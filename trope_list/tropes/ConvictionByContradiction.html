</div></div><p>The classic whodunit challenges the viewer to solve the crime along with the detective. Since the viewer isn't a professional, the crime has to be set up so that the solution doesn't rely on skills only a professional criminologist would have. These mysteries often work by reducing the crime to a logic puzzle: you solve the mystery by finding the fact that doesn't fit.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The problem with this is the "solution" at the back of the book doesn't give the perp a chance to offer a perfectly reasonable explanation.
</p><p>So, for example, let's say the police are investigating a murder, and Bob is their lead suspect. Bob says that at the time of the murder he was attending a party and his friend Alice was there with him. But wait! It turns out that Alice was on vacation in a foreign country at the time, so she couldn't have attended the party with Bob.
</p><p>In fiction, this is usually enough to prove Bob's guilt, or at least cast serious suspicion on Bob. In the real world, of course, this does not in any way mean that Bob committed murder. Maybe Bob still attended the party, but it was with his friend <em>Allison,</em> not Alice. Maybe the party was a different night and Bob just mis-remembered. Maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSecret">Bob was lying because he was doing something embarrassing that still wasn't, you know, murder</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Real crimes aren't logic puzzles and mere factual inconsistencies aren't a substitute for hard evidence. Poking holes in a suspect's story might push a jury towards the edge, but it's not going to convince them by itself. You might be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullTheThread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullTheThread">Pull the Thread</a>, but on its own, proving that the suspect lied about something doesn't prove he committed the crime (especially if he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSecret">Big Secret</a>). At best, this kind of logic game can be used during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating">Perp Sweating</a> to get a confession. At worst, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown">Detective Brown</a> will arrest the perp immediately, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason">Perry Mason</a> wouldn't even break a sweat getting an acquittal from that.
</p><p>More realistic examples focus on the investigative side, where the contradiction satisfies the significantly lower standard of proof required to <em>arrest</em> someone and investigate them further, rather than the much higher standard to <em>convict</em> them, or on non-legal contexts where the solution is just about swaying people's opinions rather than meeting any rigorous standard of proof. Some stories <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwave</a> this issue by having the contradiction lead to further investigation and the discovery of more concrete evidence. In stories involving teenage perpetrators, the crimes are often rather minor and the solution has them immediately confess when the contradiction is pointed out; this is somewhat less plausible against adult suspects, but even in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, plenty of people don't know their rights or make mistakes when pressed.

A contradiction in the defense's alibi doesn't necessarily prove them guilty if the prosecution otherwise failed to make its case; but for the prosecution, even an entirely innocent mistake in a key witness statement can call the credibility of the entire statement into question and cause the case to collapse.

This has happened so often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown">Encyclopedia Brown</a></em> shorts that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RenamedTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RenamedTropes">the former Trope Name</a> was "Bugs Meany is Gonna Walk".
<ul><li> A "witness" trying to frame a boy for the theft of a pocket knife claims the boy took the knife with his right hand, and put it in his pocket while running away. He is found innocent because he has a cast on his left hand and the knife was found in his left pants pocket (planted there by the "witness") and (according to the answers section at least) it's impossible to put a pocket knife in your left pants pocket with your right hand while running. Leaving aside that Encyclopedia was assuming an impossibility out of a difficult and highly improbable physical stunt, the mere likelihood of him putting the knife in his left pocket after he'd stopped running never occurred to him.
</li><li> The perp claims to have been out of town during the crime, but knows details about some contemporaneous local event (because, clearly, he never talks to anyone about local events or reads newspapers).
</li><li> The perp claims to have seen something by moonlight on a night when there was no moon. It's entirely possible that the perp saw the incident by another ambient source of light and simply assumed it was moonlight. Interestingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> got an acquittal in a case in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff_Armstrong">exactly this manner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, though in his case it was used to show that, without moonlight, it would have been impossible to see something 150 ft away at night in 1858.
</li><li> A boy blows his fake alibi by tracing a shirt pocket on the wrong side of his chest. This is perfectly understandable, since everyone is accustomed to seeing images of themselves in the mirror, where left and right are flipped.
</li><li> A man accused of committing a robbery is being interrogated in the crime scene and claims he has never been there before. Shortly afterward, he says, "When you brought me <em>back</em> here, did I resist?" to the police officer. Since he couldn't be brought <em>back</em> if he had never been there before, the man is guilty. First of all, the term "back" doesn't have to mean "return." It can simply indicate distance or location, shown in common phrases such as, "He's from back east." You can also say you're taking someone "back" somewhere if <em>you've</em> already been there. The all-too-common example would be asking a stranger, "Want to go back to my place?"
</li><li> A perp claims to have been on the bottom floor of a building when the crime was committed, yet when he went to the elevator, he pressed the "up button." Encyclopedia deduces that the perp was probably not on the very bottom floor, because the perp wouldn't have had to distinguish the button as the "up button" because there wouldn't have been a "down button." Of course, an "up button" is always an "up button" whether or not there's a "down button" along with it. The actual name for them is "call button", but it's rarely used outside of technical and legal documentation. Besides, plenty of call buttons still have the appropriate arrow on them even when they're on the top and bottom floors.
</li><li> The perp tells someone he's hidden a $2 bill between an odd and even page of a book that are normally on opposite sides of a leaf if the book is read left to right. It might be possible that the book had a typo, breaks the tradition, had its pages printed out of order, or the perp simply misremembered the book pages.
</li><li> A stolen rare coin is found inside Bugs Meany's hot dog. How did Encyclopedia know where to find it? Because he saw Bugs spread mustard <em>on top</em> of the sauerkraut, and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">no one</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">likes hot dogs</a> does that." Admittedly, it is a pretty messy way to go about things (similar to trying to spread peanut butter on top of jelly), but c'mon. Interestingly, the story effectively admits Bugs <em>would</em> have walked if he'd been willing to finish his hot dog, and presumably swallow the coin in the process. Also a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a>, as a modern reader would expect the mustard to come out of a squeeze bottle and be easier to have on top than the sauerkraut. Plus, who's to say Bugs hadn't just <em>overlooked</em> the mustard jar, or that someone else was hogging it, when he first started applying his hot dog toppings?
</li><li> The perp buys time to rob his victim's house by asking the victim to add four tubes of toothpaste to his supermarket order of seven items. This required the victim to check out in a regular shopping lane instead of the 10-items-or-less express lane, which otherwise would have allowed him to return in time to see his house being robbed. Brown figures it out because the perp was the last of the victim's friends to ask for items, and his order was too plainly designed to surpass the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressLaneLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressLaneLimit">Express Lane Limit</a>. Of course, the fact that the perp counted on both the victim and grocery staff to obey the letter of the express lane rules and for the express lane line to be open and available at the same time he was at the store pretty much means he deserved to get caught. Even Donald Sobol (the author) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">seemed to realize that this one was flimsy</a>; Mrs. Brown specifically mentions that the store is notorious for demanding <em>exactly</em> ten items for the express lane. That doesn't quite fix the problems (again, the lane might not have been open in the first place), but points for trying.
</li><li> Bugs Meany holds a raffle drawing at a fair for a baseball glove and has one of his friends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">reach around for another associate's balls</a> in the big container of ping-pong balls. Encyclopedia discovers he was cheating by noticing that Bugs drank a canned soda when he was carrying around a thermos, thus meaning he put the ball in the freezer, then took it to the fairgrounds in the thermos so the associate would just have to feel around for a frozen ball. It's entirely possible that Bugs simply didn't want whatever was in his thermos at that particular moment or was <em>saving</em> it for later. Or that he'd already emptied his thermos, and found himself wanting another drink.
</li><li> A carnival tent gets upended, and the take is stolen in the confusion. When Encyclopedia studies the injuries of the performers, he suspects the magician; the reason? He's wearing a short-sleeved outfit, and "all magicians wear long sleeves to hide things in." This example is also listed under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue">Conviction by Counterfactual Clue</a>.
</li><li> Two precious ivory bookends belonging to a former circus owner are stolen when two of the man's friends are visiting. Encyclopedia and his father find strange handprints in the beach near the circus owner's house, and so suspicion falls on one of the visitors, a crippled acrobat, because the only way he could have walked was on his hands. Encyclopedia, however, insists that the thief is in fact the other visitor, a former bareback rider, because she said her leather gloves were missing, and "no one brings leather gloves to a seaside town in the summer." (Because she couldn't possibly have brought the gloves for a legitimate reason like playing golf, as driving gloves, or even riding a horse. And she <em>certainly</em> couldn't have packed them by accident. Or maybe she just really liked the gloves and bring them everywhere.)
</li><li> A perp who's trying to frame Encyclopedia for claiming ownership of the town clock and charging people to use it to set their watches is "proved" as a liar because he used his left hand to set his own watch, because of the "fact" that when you set your watch with your left hand, you're holding it upside down. (Because it's impossible that a person could simply be more comfortable using their left hand, and compensate for it when setting their watch, or that one could buy left-handed watches specifically to avoid this problem, and ignoring that watch faces are quite easy to read upside down.)
</li><li> A perp is accused of stealing something that belonged to Encyclopedia's client, and riding away on her bicycle. She claims that she hasn't ridden her bike all summer, before she takes it out of storage and starts showing off on it. Encyclopedia declares that she's lying, because if she hadn't ridden the bicycle like she claimed, the tires would have gone flat. (Because it's impossible that the girl or her parents could have kept the tires inflated in case she ever decided she wanted to go for a bike ride.)
</li><li> A man tries to claim insurance money on a painting he's reported stolen. His story goes that while shaving after a shower, he saw reflected in the mirror a man stalking away with the painting. Encyclopedia explains that the claim is a fraud because a mirror would be foggy after a shower and so the man wouldn't have been able to see anything. (Never mind that it only takes a second to wipe away condensation, something people often do when they <em>need to shave</em>. Or cold showers, or how movement and shapes are still discernible through a foggy mirror. Or how some people use a fan or leave the bathroom door open specifically so that the mirror doesn't fog up in the first place. And finally, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>, fog-free mirrors now exist.)
</li><li> A sailor wins a painting contest open only to amateurs. He is called out as a professional painter pretending to be a sailor because he failed to do the research on nautical terminology: he used terms like "left" or "right" when describing a boat he was painting rather than the nautical terms like "port" or "starboard", as well as the redundant phrase "knots per hour"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bh70');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bh70" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bh70');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A knot is a unit of speed referring to approx. 1 nautical mile per hour. Technically, this would be acceleration</span>, mistakes that no one remotely familiar with sailing would have made regardless of their expertise level. However, while "he's a professional painter trying to pass as an amateur" is the most likely explanation for the masquerade and was probably sufficient grounds on its face to get him disqualified, he might have had other reasons for the pretense and it's not ironclad evidence he's an actual professional.
</li><li> Still another case hinged on the detective's belief that a real resident of San Francisco would never ever refer to the city as "Frisco." While it's true that residents of the city traditionally hate that nickname, it's not exactly an enforced law, at least not since <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Norton">Emperor Norton<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> died.
</li><li> A case had a kid that finished last in a race correctly identify a song being played at a theater along the race route as "The Eyes of Texas," rather than (the presumably more identifiable to a kid in Florida) "I've Been Working on the Railroad," "proving" that she stopped in to ensure that she would finish last. Because she couldn't simply have been a football fan who had seen the Longhorns play. This compounded by the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue">two songs aren't even the same</a>"I've Been Working on the Railroad" has more lines, to a different tune.
</li><li> A blind man is the only witness to a crime; a perp fleeing the scene with a bag of cash crashed into him, and it is thought that the man might have felt his face well enough to identify him if he felt it again. Turns out the blind man is not blind, and was in on it the whole time: he swapped bags with the thief when they collided. How does Encyclopedia prove this? When he visited the man in his hotel room, the lights were on and there was a newspaper on the table despite the man claiming he hadn't had visitors in "a long time". Because no hotel in the world offers complementary newspapers that they put in your room. And they <em>never</em> have the lights on when you arrive. And a blind man would totally notice if they were on, and turn them off. This is a lesser example, however.

</li><li> Bugs steals an antique teacup. When Encyclopedia confronts him about it, Bugs claims that that it was a prized cup from the owner of a Chinese restaurant that has since gone out of business. Encyclopedia deduces that he's lying by noticing that the cup has a handle, which Chinese teacups do not have. (Because it's impossible for a Chinese guy to like American mugs, and of course, with globalisation Chinese teacups with handles do exist now.)
</li><li> One story had a girl having one of her sneakers stolen from her before a sneaker contest was held. The thief was identified because she said to another person that the girl had the sneaker stolen from her "while clipping her toenails", even though all the girl said was that she was "clipping her nails". And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">only the thief would know that she had been clipping her toenails and not her fingernails</a> (even though if someone said she had her sneaker stolen while clipping her nails before a contest involving feet, most would immediately assume the nails WERE toenails, not fingernails.) There's no reason to take your shoes off to clip your fingernails, and it's a safe bet a person would notice someone stealing shoes that <em>they were wearing at the time</em>, making it even less of a stretch to assume that toenails were meant.
</li><li> Encyclopedia's dad described a case to him after the fact that involved a professional tennis instructor who reported that a set of ivory screens had been stolen that morning. He saw the thief's face; it could be either of two identical twinsone who worked as a cashier and one who played tennis. Encyclopedia figures out that the victim was just lying so he could get insurance money for the screens, because the crook was wearing a T-shirt, and if the tennis player had been the culprit, one arm would be more developed, while equal arms would incriminate the cashier. This assumes that the cashier had the presence of mind to make such an astute observation, and also assumes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue">untrue "fact"</a> that all tennis players have asymmetrical arms.
</li><li> In one story, a man claimed an item of his had been stolen during a thunderstorm. The house was dark because the power was out. He was awoken by a thunderclap, then saw the burglar <em>in the lightning flash that followed</em>. E Brown knew that the man was lying (he had actually stolen his own property for the insurance money, then made up the story), since in real life, thunder follows lightning, not the other way around. Of course, it's inconceivable that there would be <em>more than one lightning flash</em> during the course of a thunderstorm.
</li><li> A contest is held in which contestants complete a quiz for 3 secret prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. The first place winner receives the best prize: a watch, which he discovers has been broken. The theory of the crime is one of the contestants secretly examined the prizes and played with the watch and broke it. The culprit turns out to be the 2nd place girl that purposely missed a question she should have gotten right: "Name a word that has three double-letters." The girl referred to herself as a "bookkeeper". This doesn't account for the possibility that the word simply slipped her mind at that exact moment. Or perhaps she can't spell itthinks it only has one k, for example, or thinks it's two words. Or perhaps she hyphenates the word, as "book-keeper" (a valid, if rather old, spelling), splitting one of the double letters.
</li><li> One case was solved because the culprit claimed their wobbly table was knocked and various possessions spilled on the floor. EB points out that the table was three-legged, and that such tables can't tilt. Three-legged tables won't be wobbly even if the legs are different lengths. However, if the table was on a slant to begin with, jostling it might very well knock it over, or at least knock the items off.
</li><li> At least one time the series used this trope absolutely correctly. Bugs claims to have been kidnapped at Encyclopedia's behest (how a 5th-grader was able to hire and control adult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> is never discussed). He describes being imprisoned in a small room, and attempts to escape by removing the pins from the door hinges, but they are on the other side of the door. Then he tries to wait to the side of the door and jump his kidnappers when they come in, but the door opens into his face, foiling the attack. Standard house doors <em>cannot</em> open away from their hinges, only toward them.
</li><li> Encyclopedia Brown liked solutions where the answer hinged on an American city having the same name as a foreign place that was generally more famous, for example Paris, Texas. This isn't usually conviction by contradiction, but became a case of it in the answer to one puzzle involving an American city called Palestine, where Encyclopedia declared that it <em>had</em> to be the American city because "nobody calls the real one Palestine anymore." Apparently in Encyclopedia Brown's world, Palestinians don't exist. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12a1h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12a1h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12a1h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Current political controversies notwithstanding, prior to the 1967 War the non-existence of Palestine was indeed generally considered a non-controversial matter.</span>
</li><li> A boy gets injured in the foot by an unknown suspect. Another boy is asked to bring a spare shoe for the injured party. Brown deduces the other boy is the perp because he brought the right shoe for the injured foot without asking beforehand which shoe to bring. While common sense might suggest to the boy to think about which foot would need the shoe, he still had a 1 in 2 chance of getting the right shoe if it didn't occur to him right at that moment to ask and, although the wrong shoe might not fit comfortably, it could still fit his foot if the size allows for enough space. Encyclopedia does point out, however, that if the boy didn't know which shoe to bring, he would likely have brought back <em>both</em> shoes. The boy brought back <em>only</em> the one, however, which made Encyclopedia suspicious.
</li><li> A local con man claims to have bred chickens that can lay square eggs. He comes up with a lame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwave</a> as to why he simply can't show them, and claims instead that he'll stage a publicity stunt by having the skydiver standing with him jump holding one in a box only to have it still intact afterwards but needs money for promotion. Encyclopedia calls him out because the skydiver is wearing only one parachute, and all jump with two in case one fails...because there's no chance that someone might wear something different to a publicity event than during actual skydiving. Granted the con man does describe his accomplice as dressed "ready to jump", but considering the whole absurdity of the situation (the convenient excuse as to why he can't just show the eggs, the fact that a square probably would be crushed if held by a skydiver anyway, why such a stunt would even be necessary to promote square eggs, and of course, what the hell besides novelty value is the benefit of square eggs anyway?) it seems kind of silly that Encyclopedia quibbles over such a minor technicality. The "Solution" page at the end of the book even admits that had Wiggins not embellished his con by bringing his friend along, Encyclopedia would have had nothing to use against him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">he could've successfully screwed the kids out of their money</a>.
</li><li> A note about who was supposed to receive some calendars couldn't have been written by a math teacher because it says "divide the calendars by 1/2", which would actually be multiplying by 2, because math teachers never make mistakes in grammar or use common English-language phrasing fallacies outside of the context of the classroom.
</li><li> Combining with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">I Never Said It Was Poison</a>", Encyclopedia is at the dentist's and has his rollerskates stolen. The perp <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">manages to identify himself</a> because he never even heard of him (Dr. Vivian) until Brown mentioned him, and he wasn't at the dentist's because "I had a sprained wrist, not a toothache". Because he couldn't have found out that Vivian was a dentist through other means (such as being close enough to notice that this is a dentist's office), or simply assumed "Vivian" was male since Vivian is a gender-neutral name. (In fact, it's only been seen as a feminine name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">Since around the 40s or 50s</a>.)

The protagonists find out that a miracle religion is a front for a money scam. Both the founder and the first pupil claim that they are innocent and the other was manipulating him to get money. The protagonist asks both of them privately what happened. He first asks the pupil about what the founder did with the money, and the pupil answers that the founder never let anyone else close to it. Then the protagonist asks the founder how he didn't notice the money next to boxes of equipment, and the founder answers that he didn't notice the boxes of money. The protagonist finds that the founder is innocent because the founder incorrectly stated that the money was put into boxes when it was actually placed inside bags <em>next</em> to boxes. If the pupil was telling the truth, then the founder would have known that the money was put inside bags.

<ul><li> A notable example of forcing the culprit to come clean after being caught in a misstep is in one case in which a person is murdered in a cabin during a blizzard. The culprit's alibi is that they were buying snacks, but did not buy ice cream because they were "sold out". And why would anyone be sold out of ice cream in a blizzard? The culprit could have just as easily lied and said she didn't get ice cream because it would melt due to it being a blizzard (Thus requiring the car to have the heat on, and the trip up being slowed.)

<ul><li> The Swedish edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ThePhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ThePhantom">The Phantom</a></em> had a few pages of reader-submitted letters and material for a long time; one mainstay was various whodunnits, of course concocted by one of the readers. One whodunnit was a murder taking place in Germany, and one suspect claimed to have been in the woods picking berries at the time, while the other said he had been at the movies seeing a Bond movie, and remarked on Bond's funny German accent. While the readers were supposed to suspect the latter (Bond is German?), certain little-known cultural traits were at workmovies are always dubbed over with German speech in Germany, whereas picking berries in wooded areas you don't own counts as theft and/or trespassing, in contrast to Swedish law which allows it.
</li><li> One early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em> comic featured a woman impersonating a man claiming to be Supergirl's husband-that-she-forgot-she-had, in order to make her (the woman's) boyfriend give up his crush on Supergirl. Supergirl saw through this at the beginning, because the woman put "his" arms around Supergirl's neck when "he" kissed her rather than around her waist, which is apparently something <em>only</em> girls do.

There's another problem: an <em>electrician</em> is someone who works hands-on in electrical systems installation, maintenance, troubleshooting and repair, while an <em>electrical engineer</em> is usually someone who designs such systems but does not physically work on them.

</li><li> Inverted <em>again</em> in another story where Archie accidentally spills paint remover on an 1870 Frederick Church painting that Mr. Lodge buys from an art dealer. Mr. Lodge is predictably upset, but then Archie wipes away more paint and finds the signature "Picasso". Mr. Lodge is suddenly thrilled, thinking that he's actually discovered a long-lost painting by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PabloPicasso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PabloPicasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, but then his butler Smithers reminds him that Picasso was born after 1870, the date when Church supposedly painted his picture. When it dawns on Mr. Lodge that Church couldn't have painted over Picasso's original painting if Picasso wasn't even <em>born</em> yet, he realizes that he's being conned. Mr. Lodge then takes back his check from the crooked art dealer, and gets Smithers to help him literally throw the dealer out of the house.
</li><li> Yet another story had Archie and Jughead housesitting for Mr. Lodge and Veronica while they went on a family trip. A crooked art dealer and one of Mr. Lodge's security guards use the opportunity to steal Mr. Lodge's collection of priceless paintings and replace them with forgeries, while trashing the Lodge house to make it look like Archie and Jughead threw a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty">Wild Teen Party</a> and distract Mr. Lodge. When he comes home, Mr. Lodge falls for it and is furious with Archie and Jughead, but then Archie realizes that the paintings weren't at all damaged by the "party". He convinces Mr. Lodge that they were hung after the wrecking was done, and proves that they're fakes. Archie and Jughead then direct the police to the art gallery, where they find Mr. Lodge's real paintings. Archie explains that the crooked art dealer couldn't bear to damage his expert forgeries and ended up tipping Archie off to the fact that they were fakes, which makes this a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazi">Grammar Nazi</a> Aunt Josephine's alleged suicide note contains several grammatical errors, leading the Baudelaire siblings to believe it is a forgery. It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the note was genuine, but the <em>suicide</em> was fake, and the errors were a coded message to that effect</span>.
</li><li> Some examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown">Encyclopedia Brown</a></em> author Donald J. Sobol's less famous solve-it-yourself series for adults, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwoMinuteMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwoMinuteMysteries">Two-Minute Mysteries</a></em>, starring Detective (no first name given) Haledjian:
<ul><li> Haledjian knows someone is the culprit because he claims that a cook in the kitchen was yelling and waving a bright red lobster before he was found murdered. The lobster wasn't supposed to be cooked yet, and lobsters are only red when they're cooked. However, that detail wouldn't be impossible, just weird. The back cover of a regular mystery might well say something like, "Why was the cook waving an already-cooked lobster before he was killed?" Another question is, was the cook yelling <em>because</em> the lobster had already been cooked?
</li><li> Haledjian knows that Nick the Nose, the informant, is lying (as he always is), because he claims that a dying Brazilian's last words were in Spanish, and the national language of Brazil is actually Portuguese. (Because the Brazilian couldn't be one of the many immigrants to Brazil from nearby Spanish-speaking countries. And because it would be impossible for a native Brazilian to speak his last words in a foreign language. And because it would be impossible for an Anglophone informant to simply <em>mistake</em> Portuguese for the extremely-similar-sounding and more commonly heard Spanish language.) In fact, depending on what he said, it could sound exactly the same in Spanish or Portuguese, especially from the mouth of a dying man (who presumably isn't speaking particularly clearly).
</li><li> One of the cases involved the apparent suicide of an actor and Haledjian claiming that the note left behind was a fraud written by an English rival of the deceased because the note used "theatre" instead of "theater" and other British spellings. (Because apparently, Americans are only supposed to use American spellings. And no one <em>ever</em> uses "-re" to refer to stage productions and "-er" to refer to a local multiplex.)This one is particularly egregious: most actors, even American ones, probably <em>would</em> spell it "theatre", unless they were specifically referring to a movie house. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">This Very Wiki</a> uses "Theatre" as the namespace for plays, not "Theater".
</li><li> Another case has Haledjian declaring someone's alibi faulty because the person identified the tune a band was playing as "God Save the Queen" rather than "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" (which has the exact same tune), and so knew about a British performing troupe being in town. Many American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> companies play "God Save the Queen" before performances, and as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a>, it's <em>always</em> "God Save the Queen"; he could also simply be an Anglophile. Even worse, the actual <em>name</em> of the tune is "National Anthem."
</li><li> The alleged murderer claims to have not visited his friend for days, but is caught because he leapt over the freshly-painted stairs and knocked on the window set into the door rather than the freshly-painted door itself. (Because it's not like fresh paint <em>looks</em> and <em>smells</em> like fresh paint, especially fresh <em>white</em> paint. And because it's not like some people leap over stairs as a matter of course, or like knocking on a window is often simply <em>louder</em> than knocking on a heavy door.) This is one of the many cases that were recycled for Encyclopedia Brown to solve.
</li><li> An English professor's suicide note is considered fraudulent and a product of foul play because it contains a split infinitive. (Because English professors always follow grammatical rules, even when distraught and suicidal, and all English professors accept "don't split infinitives in English" as a rule.)
</li><li> Haledjian also dealt with the rather more plausible inversion, where the suicide note was in perfect grammatical English despite the dead man being an uneducated Italian immigrant who read the news in an Italian-language newspaper.
</li><li> The suspect claims it is his first time in the victim's house, but when a doorbell rings, he knows to answer the back door. (Because nobody can <em>hear</em> where a given sound is coming from, and it's certainly not that front doors often always have a double ring (ding-dong) and back doors a single ring (ding). And because there's no way at all the suspect could be from, live in, or have lived in a town where it's customary to do everything at the back door except on special occasions.)
</li><li> The painting's owner claimed to be getting dressed to investigate the disturbance, with his right leg in his pants and his left leg out. (<em>Everybody</em> always gets dressed and undressed left-leg-first. Didn't you know that?)
</li><li> A criminal's itinerary read "Palestine" instead of "Israel", thus revealing he wasn't <em>actually</em> going to the Middle East as his girlfriend claimed. (Not a lot of tolerance for potential political differences.)
</li><li> "An arrow flight away"/"A narrow flight away": The detective was specifically looking at the flight of stairs when he said it and the suspect still replied "then why don't you go <em>outside</em> and look for it?", rather than "upstairs", revealing that he knew that the stolen diamond had been shot out of the house with a bow and arrow.
</li><li> "Flawless"/"floorless" The police have confiscated a car whose floorboard was used to smuggle drugs. Haledjian is trying to catch the crooks by posing as car salesman "Flawless Phil". He mentions to one prospective buyer that "the interior is floorless"; when the buyer walks away, Haledjian orders him arrested on the grounds that had he been innocent, he would have heard "floorless" as "flawless", the slogan of the lot. While there are accents that make 'flawless' and 'floorless' sound similar or even the same, there are many more where they are quite distinct. And in either case, isn't it possible that the guy <em>just didn't like the car</em> or perhaps he had to take a dump? (In this case the guy didn't help his case by acting really nervous.)
</li><li> In one of the Two-Minute Mysteries, the suspect was caught after Haledjian said the (diamond?) was hidden in the cupola because the murderer was the only one who ran up towards the attic instead of to the kitchen. Because only a murderer could know that a cupola (usually "KOOP-ul'uh", but the pronunciation varies by person enough that "kupp-ola" wouldn't be suspicious) was a term for the little domed thing on top of the house and not just an annoying term for a cappuccino maker, that only someone who had killed the house's occupant would assume that the stairs going up lead to the roof level, and that it's impossible to see a cupola from outside the house.
</li><li> In one case, the question of whether or not a ring bearing a very valuable jewel was stolen or legally bequeathed comes down to the accusing party's testimony. She says that when she saw the deceased for the last time (when he supposedly bequeathed it to her), he was reading a book and wearing the ring on his right hand, so when he turned a page the gem flashed brilliantly. Haledjian figures that the 'witness' is lying because the dead man was reading a book written in Hebrew before he diedand Hebrew is written right to left. The man would have been turning the left page with his left hand, not the right page with his right hand... But most people turn the page with their <em>dominant</em> hand, regardless of direction. If Haledjian had been correct here, then people would use a different hand to flip back through a book than to flip forward through it. Even animators knew this wasn't true. Also, Haledjian would be discounting the possibility that he was flipping back a few pages, perhaps to find a passage.
</li><li> Sometimes, Haledjian completely disregards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor">sheer stupidity as an answer</a>. In one mystery, he was on his way to a BBQ when the host was found murdered. His neighbor came over, saying he heard his wife scream in horror, and during the interrogation, spotted the wife's pearl earring in the grill and reached his hand in to retrieve it. The detective told him that he obviously planted the earring because, despite having just arrived, he knew that the coals were cool enough to plunge his hand into them. Apart from the fact that coal visibly whitens when heated and that people can sense heat when standing next to hot coals, does he ever consider the fact that the guy could have just been an idiot?
</li><li> In one case, the head of an orchestra had two skilled violinists and had to decide which would play a solo on opening night. He picks A about five minutes before the performance is meant to start. When he goes to get A, he finds A has been killed, and then has to pick B. Haledjian decides that it must have been B who did it, because B walked onto the stage, sat down and began to play, when he should have tuned his violin and rosined his bow first. Like it's totally unthinkable that someone with an equal chance of getting a part would get themselves ready to play it, especially if the choice wasn't going to be made until about five minutes before it was meant to begin.
</li><li> In one, Inspector Winters asks for bicarbonate of soda for an upset stomach while in a bakery. The baker says she doesn't have any; this leads the detective to deduce that the bakery must be a front for smuggling, since bicarbonate of soda is baking soda and no real bakery would be without it. Except there's the possibility that the baker was unfamiliar with an antiquated term for baking soda (even more egregious today than when it was originally written: many modern <em>chemists</em> might find the term unfamiliar, since the proper scientific terminology has been "sodium hydrogen carbonate" for <em>decades</em>, and was "sodium bicarbonate" rather than "bicarbonate of soda" for some time before that). And then there's the possibility they ran out of baking soda using it to, you know, bake; or that they bake pies and pastries which don't require it.
</li></ul></li><li> There was one book of "Solve it yourself mysteries" intended for kids which seemed to do something with the trope while inverting it with more common examples:
<ul><li> One case hinged on "I was woken up by thunder and then saw a man stabbed during the lightning" because lightning always comes before thunder. Yeah, makes sense, but apparently, there was only <em>one</em> strike of lightning.
</li><li> Another case from the book had a murder take place at a country club wherein someone was pushed down a hill and broke his neck in the fall. The tennis player who reported it was apparently the murderer because he had a grass stain on his shoes and of course, tennis players would have different shoes for tennis than walking around in the grass. Yeah, you'd have a point there, since many tennis players keep a separate pair of shoes specifically for tennis the way people do for a lot of sports, but apparently, the grass stains <em>certainly</em> couldn't have come when he ran over to see if the victim was okay or not. (In real life, it'd have been <em>more</em> suspicious if he stopped to change his shoes like the detective thought he would.)
</li><li> Another one had a victim killed by having a heavy clock dropped on his head, and there were two murderers. All three suspects claim it was most likely an accident. Person #1's alibi was that he was watching a TV show at the time of the murder. Person #2 hears something fall to the floor from down the hall and runs to investigate, and person #3 was out smoking, then walked in and simply found #1 and #2 standing over the body. The detective says that Person #1 and #2 are guilty for several reasons. One, the clock stopped at 8:51 and no TV show ends at 8:51. This is an analog clock (the stories were written in the '70s) and evidently, there's not the possibility that it might have been simply <em>running slowly</em> (or that the clock's hands got jarred by the impact). The second one also apparently couldn't have heard the body from the other side of the hall, but it's actually not impossible to hear something heavy fall to the floor, especially if it's a clock heavy enough to kill someone.
</li><li> Lampshaded in one story where the detective is listening to someone's testimony on a crime, and mentions it won't stand up in court because he was telling the story as he saw it, through the mirror of a car.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> this in one of his stories, in which a character points out that in most detective stories all the detective's deductions could easily be picked apart by a competent defense lawyer and it's a good thing the detective is always able to use their deductions to make the perpetrator panic and incriminate themselves before they go to trial. That didn't stop him from flirting with the trope himself, though.
</li><li> In one short story, two similar-looking girls work in a library. One of them murders the other, but claims she has an alibishe was accepting a book return from a student at a certain point before the murder. The detective deduces that it was the other librarian who had accepted the book, because the student shared a name with the author of THE chemical reference, period. A professional chemistry librarian could no more forget the name "Beilstein" any more than a conductor could forget an applicant named "Ludwig van Beethoven". The student recalled that the librarian had smiled at hearing his name, but the surviving librarian didn't recall anything unusual about the student. Not much evidence, but since she confesses later, that's what would matter in court.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackWidowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackWidowers">Black Widowers</a></em>:
<ul><li> "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpellIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpellIt">Spell It</a>!": The man makes a <em>huge deal</em> about his name being famous after a bookstore clerk innocently asks him to spell it. Of course, this version discounts the fact that two different people may spell similar-sounding names differently, thus leading a clerk to <em>always</em> double-check.
</li><li> "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhatTimeIsIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhatTimeIsIt">What Time Is It</a>": One of those stories inverted this trope by having the shaky evidence (that an accountant would associate the phrase "half past eight" with 8:50 since "eight and a half dollars" is $8.50 and accountants are marinated in money) given to a defense lawyer with an innocent client, so that he can use it to impeach an otherwise unshakable witness. The story was written at a time when digital clocks were still relatively new. The characters admit that, while not conclusive evidence, this could be used by the guest, a defense attorney, to sow reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors, allowing his client to be acquitted.
</li></ul></li><li> "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoRefugeCouldSave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoRefugeCouldSave">No Refuge Could Save</a>": Challenges like "sing the National Anthem" or "who was last year's World Champion?" were often used to find spies, at least in the movies. Dr Asimov inverts the typical approach by identifying someone as a German spy because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondVerseCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondVerseCurse">no American could possibly know all four verses of the Star Spangled Banner</a>. They must've been a spy who <em>over</em>prepared for the former challenge. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Dr Asimov had very strong feelings</a> about the song, and considered it a tragedy that Americans didn't know it. He also wrote an essay about the importance of all four verses.
</li><li> In one of Dr Asimov's short mystery stories, the culprit is a Québécois person using a false identity of an American. The detective tricks him into revealing his true identity by asking him to write the word "Montréal", and he writes it with an <em>accent aigu</em> on the e, whereas someone who only spoke English wouldn't spell it that way. To rule out innocent explanations for this information, the interrogator establishes by prior questioning that the American identity doesn't speak a word of French. Never mind that you can know about the etymology of words without also knowing the language the word was originally from, or that he might have seen someone else write it "Montréal" and followed suit, or that "Montréal" is in fact the <em>official</em> spelling, not only in French but also in English.
</li><li> "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSingingBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSingingBell">The Singing Bell</a>": Since the detective is only looking for enough evidence to convince a judge to mind probe the individual, that provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justification</a> for the shaky evidence. The mind probe can, by law, only be done to a particular individual one time in their life, so it's only performed for very serious crimes (like murder) when there's very good reason to suspect the accused is guilty, but not enough evidence to actually <em>convict</em> them. It's used to collect more evidence directly from the mind of the accused.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDyingNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDyingNight">The Dying Night</a>": Wendall Urth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneInDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneInDetective">Phone-In Detective</a>, deduces the killer's identity through the circumstantial evidence of "he was the one most surprised by sunlight". The flaw in this reasoning is that both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mercury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mercury">Mercury</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMoon">The Moon</a> have very long nights. The assumption that the light-sensitive recording would be safe in starlight (and safely retrieved days later) could have been made by either of Dr Kaunas or Dr Talliaferro. The justification for proving which one of them killed Romero Villiers is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue">Conviction by Counterfactual Clue</a> due to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">astronomical assumption being proved wrong</a> (we now know that Mercury rotates around the sun twice for every three "days").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LuckyStarrAndTheMoonsOfJupiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LuckyStarrAndTheMoonsOfJupiter">Lucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter</a></em>: Bigman suspects blind Mr. Norrich of being a spy and not blind at all. His arguments are that the man is sitting with the lights on, and that he noticed when Bigman turned the lights off. However, the man provides perfectly good explanations; he realized Bigman turned off the lights because he heard him tiptoeing toward the wall and his guide dog going to sleep, and as for the lights... well, it doesn't matter to him, but it would probably matter to any friend who might come to visit.
</li></ul></li><li> A series of short plays for kids published in the UK featured a detective with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">catchphrase</a> "And I can prove it, because you made four silly mistakes". The mistakes rarely proved anything. (In fact, one of them was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">fallacy namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">No True Scotsman</a>; a character during the Jacobite Rebellion is exposed as an English spy because, amongst other things, he puts sugar on his porridge...)
</li><li> One short story in the anthology <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s Sinister Spies</em> is called "QL696.C9", by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyBoucher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyBoucher">Anthony Boucher</a>. It's about a librarian who was killed, leaving a the titular mysterious sequence of letters and numbers nearby. At the end of the story, the detective gathers the suspects in the, um, library in the traditional fashion,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> declares that the code was probably a library subject reference number, and starts to look it up</span>. He's interrupted by the need to keep the murderer (a spy), from killing herself with the pistol she hid in her blouse. Turns out he knew it was her as soon as he figured out what the code was for, as the killer had the only name that was a noun, and the whole library scene was just to flush her out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> kicks in when you realize that the detective needed something from the suspect to avert this trope, since there's all sorts of perfectly good reasons a librarian would have to write down a Library of Congress reference code <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for swifts</span>. Ironically, the anthology in question comes up when you search the LoC for the code.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a>, in one of his books, wrote a parody of the detective-catching-one-mistake trope (<em>Match Wits with Inspector Ford</em>). The situations and answers were all absurd. For instance, a kidnapping victim returns home by asking his kidnappers if he could go to a football game that he only had one ticket for. The detective figures out that he's in on it with the kidnappers, because his parents are in their 80s and he's 60 years old, and "nobody would kidnap a 60-year-old man, as it makes no sense."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDicksonCarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDicksonCarr">John Dickson Carr</a> specifically warns aspiring mystery writers about this kind of clue in his essay "The Greatest Game in the World." Of course, if you do what he advocates, having guilt depend on a series of clues rather than just one, you won't have that problem.
</li><li> <em>Uncle John's Bathroom Reader</em> had a series of simple mysteries featuring Leslie Boies and her companion, Steve. In one story, Steve tells Leslie about a man whose life was saved because the night watchman at the factory he owned told him he dreamt the train he usually took was going to crash. So the man waited for a later train, and sure enough, his usual train crashed. Leslie comments that the watchman should be fired, because if he dreamt about the train, he must have been sleeping on the job. Because he couldn't have had the dream when he was back at home, clearly. This is a variant on the tale that actually <em>introduces</em> the element that makes this qualify; in other versions, the dreamer specifically states that he had the dream at a time when he was at work.
</li><li> In one of the stories in Maurice Leblanc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArseneLupin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArseneLupin">Arsène Lupin</a> book <em>The Eight Strokes of the Clock</em>, Lupin determines that one of the extras in a silent film is infatuated with the leading lady solely from the out-of-character lustful gazes he casts upon her in the film. (These days, we'd just call that "bad acting".)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a>:
<ul><li> In one of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissMarple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissMarple">Miss Marple</a> stories in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThirteenProblems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThirteenProblems">The Thirteen Problems</a></em>, Miss Marple bases her conclusion on the fact that the gardener wasn't really a gardener, because he was working on Whit Monday.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AfterTheFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AfterTheFuneral">After the Funeral</a></em>, Poirot deduces that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the "murder victim" who showed up at the titular funeral was actually the murderer <em>disguised</em> as her. The two clues he notices? One: when the murderer later comes to the house where the repast was held supposedly for the first time, she comments on a vase of flowers that she could have only seen if she'd been there before. Two: the murder victim had a habit of twisting her head to one side when she asked probing questions, but the imposter had practiced her mimicry in a mirror and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImposterForgotOneDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImposterForgotOneDetail">turned her head in the opposite direction</a></span>. That's enough to start him on a path toward the real motive behind the murder.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SadCypress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SadCypress">Sad Cypress</a>,</em> the murderer tells a particularly silly lie — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">namely, that she pricked her wrist on a rose in the garden; when Poirot investigates, he finds that that particular genus of rose doesn't <em>have</em> thorns.</span> It's even discussed in-universe: Poirot remarks that he wouldn't have even considered that person a suspect had they not told such a stupid, pointless lie in the first place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out the pinprick mark actually came from the murderer injecting herself with an emetic after poisoning a teapot and drinking from it with the victim, thus preventing herself from dying as well.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed and then averted in the novel <em>The Franchise Affair</em> by Josephine Tey. The novel is about two women accused of kidnapping and enslaving a school girl and the attempts of their solicitor, Robert Blair, to defend them. Midway through the novel, the womens' solicitor discovers a discrepancy that can be used to cast doubt on the girl's story (she could not have seen the view out of the attic window that she describes). However, Blair realises that a clever prosecution lawyer can argue around this and even if the women are let off on this evidence, the taint of the accusations will still hang over them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouBeTheJury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouBeTheJury">You Be the Jury</a></em>: One case involved a radio DJ being kidnapped as revenge for publicizing the bad service of a local roofer. It turns out that the DJ faked the kidnapping as a publicity stunt as one piece of evidence was a photo of him after getting away from his kidnappers three days later. He was clean-shaven and the solution argues that he should have had a three-day beard.
</li><li> Subverted in <em>Death on the Way</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FreemanWillsCrofts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FreemanWillsCrofts">Freeman Wills Crofts</a>. The police prove that one of their suspects faked his alibi for the time of the murder, and consider that this is sufficient evidence to arrest him. It turns out he isn't the guilty partywhen he realised he couldn't prove his innocence, he panicked and constructed a false alibi.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TerraIgnota" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TerraIgnota">Terra Ignota</a></em>, Papadelias, the cop who brought Mycroft in after Mycroft's two-week-long murder rampage, has known for years that there is something off about Mycroft's case, based mostly on how Mycroft seemed to be in two places at the same time while committing his crimes. Every time they run into each other, he quizzes Mycroft on the timeline, trying to find discrepancies. Mycroft always has a correct and plausible answer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Papadelias is right, though. Mycroft is hiding his lover and partner in crime Saladin, who committed half the murders.</span>
</li><li> The short story collection <em>Inspector Forsooth's Whodunits</em> sets out to very deliberately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert this trope</a>, even citing the classic example of "the English professor who 'committed suicide' and left a note filled with grammatical mistakes."

His initial "contradictions" are fairly shaky, such as why is an honest businessman is meeting someone in a garage unless the person was a criminal. The real clincher that he's a phony is when he tries to attack Jack with a knife he keeps in a secret compartment of the limo; why would an ordinary businessman who can presumably afford security carry a blade in his car unless the guy he was meeting with was a criminal? Perhaps the guy's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>? In this case, it may have been as much about the knife itself as the fact that it was a specialized blade: a Microtech HALO that's something only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">Knife Nut</a> would procure.
</li><li> Played for laughs in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a> Goes Forth</em>: Blackadder reveals he discovered Nurse Fletcher Brown was a German spy when he asked her if her well-educated boyfriend had been to "one of the great universities: Oxford, Cambridge, or Hull. You failed to spot that only two of those are great Universities." To which General Melchett, a Cambridge man, replies, "That's right! Oxford's a complete dump!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em>: Shows up in the first regular episode "Murder By the Book", where Ken Franklin, half of a mystery writing team, sneers that Columbo doesn't have anything concrete linking him to the murder if his partner Jim Ferrisjust a motive, the fact that he took out a life insurance policy on the victim, the fact that someone else was murdered shortly afterward who he claimed not to know but in whose house was found a book with a personal autograph in it, and such odd behavior as opening his mail shortly after finding the body on his lawn, and withdrawing a large sum of money out of his bank account and redepositing it the next day. And Franklin's right, these things are all circumstantial evidence. Then Columbo points out that he found a vague story outline in the victim's office; apparently Columbo's (accurate) reconstruction of the murder matches one of the thousands of rough story ideas that Ferris had been scribbling down over the past couple of decades. Franklin immediately gives in, despite this being easily the <em>weakest</em> piece of evidence presented thus far.

<ul><li> In one episode, Fitz deduces that someone is the murderer, as they claimed to be a student and "you don't dress like a student" (because obviously, all students dress exactly the same way).
</li><li> In another episode, he not only deduces that someone is a closet gay, but also his alibis, because when questioned he said "I was at home with my girlfriend" rather than "I was at home with Lesley"thus showing he was afraid of saying that his girlfriend's name was a potential man's name and letting Fitz think he was at home with a man (because, of course, everybody normally says "I was at home with [name]" to complete strangers, despite the stranger not having a clue who [name] would be).

</li><li> One episode involved a serial rapist UnSub who played a particular genre of music during his crimes. The team ended up dismissing one suspect on the grounds that he had been too young to be influenced by that music when it was popular. Apparently it's an iron-clad law that your favorite music <em>must</em> be the music that was popular while you were a teenager, and that no one ever prefers music from a previous era. The episode's main sub-plot (a woman goes full-blown vigilante and kidnaps and tortures a suspect becuase she believes he's the rapist) revolves around her (apparently paranoid) belief that because she heard him play "Total Eclipse of the Heart" on the piano he's the guy — as the tortured man points out, the fact he knows how to play "Total Eclipse of the Heart" (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_-_VwrXwss">a piano melody<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcOxhH8N3Bo">that is very simple to learn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and which he insists he learned for his wife, and he even plays a couple of songs that sound similar) is not conclusive evidence at all. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">It was him</a>.</span>

Conveniently, the note happens to mention a brand of alcopop that didn't exist at the time.

Moreno's defence is that he knew he was talking to an adult from the beginning. His reasoning? No real teenager talks about their parents in a chatroom without using some kind of chatspeak term. The judge accepts this and acquits him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then turns out to be a pedophile himself, with a long history of corruption.</span>

He still has to get the lab to find more definitive proof of foul play before he could do anything substantial and the criminal wasn't arrested by the end of the episode (though the raised suspicions were enough for the wife's life insurance company to repossess the husband's newly-bought Ferrari).
</li><li> In another episode, while searching the house where the female victim of the week lived alone, Sara dramatically announces "the toilet seat is upa man was here!"... without even entering the bathroom to check if maybe the victim had been vomiting in the toilet (they'd just found a lot of spoiled food in the fridge, after all), or whether she'd been interrupted in the middle of cleaning the bathroom, etc.

He is, but the evidence presented is rather flimsy. The accuser saw him briefly look at a boy who was getting a drink at a water fountain, and she heard another boy who no longer attended their school make a vague statement. In the first instance, he was checking the other boy out, but someone taking a few seconds to look at a person getting a drink often has another explanation than the looker checking said person out. In this case, anything from, 'Yeah, I was thirsty, saw that a member of the club that's been on my case for driving away one of their members was at the fountain, and decided to find a different fountain,' to, 'I have no memory of this happening, but yeah, it's possible I was near said person when they were getting a drink and glanced at them,' would have been viable defences.

House deduces from various clues that the man is a veteran of the <em>Canadian</em> Army, and calls him out as a fraudonly to be told that although Canada didn't take part in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, they did send troops to Vietnam to enforce the Paris Peace Accords, which is how he lost his arm in a landmine incident.

When the suspect says that the library has state-of-the-art smoke detectors and Goren didn't see that detail in the magazine article, that the guy was lying becomes a major plot point. An arguably more likely explanation, that the substitute teacher was being facetious (referencing the fact that the old Library of Alexandria burned down), isn't even considered. (On the other hand, given that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfiler">Goren</a>, he probably picked up on other indicators that the teacher was lying as well, and this was just the easiest to explain.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Savior": a teenager claims she tried to lift some family jewelry for her boyfriend but when the jewels were missing, he shot her and her mother in a rage. The DA points out she could have stolen the jewelry herself without inviting her boyfriend into the house and concludes instead that she was paying the boyfriend the jewelry to murder her mother and he shot her when the jewelry was missing.
</li><li> ADA Claire Kincaid once suspected a wife of the murder the husband had just been found guilty of. Her reasoning was that in a pretrial interview, the wife tried to cover for her husband's bank account withdrawals (which the victim was blackmailing him for) with a sloppily-crafted alibi. On the witness stand during cross-examination, she stuck to the same obvious lie with no elaboration; having known ahead of time the DA would ask about the money, she had more than enough time to come up with a more plausible explanation.
</li><li> In another episode, a husband's conviction for the murder of his wife hinged on the theory he stole a brooch from her body the police later found with his mother. The defense brings in identical brooches to challenge the DA to prove the one they have is the right one. The victim's lover identifies the brooch from an engraving she'd made on the back of it.
</li><li> In one episode, Cerreta and Logan interview a murder victim's family, and the son tells them that his mother <em>wouldn't</em> have killed his father, saying that he was with her at the time of the murder. Later in the episode, Cerreta wonders why the son didn't say she <em>didn't</em> kill his father, if they were together. Although the variation, while still a leap on the part of the detectives, is rather significant in that if someone is physically with you at the time of a murder, you know full well they couldn't have done it and thus have little reason to prevaricate.

<ul><li> In one episode, Jane quickly convinces the cops that a notoriously stingy millionaire is the culprit because he offered a reward for info on his employee's killer. After 48-hours, with no actual evidence or success at interrogation, they are legally required to release him. But as the guy is leaving the building, Jane tricks him into correcting a mis-quoted line from Shakespeare, contradicting his earlier claim that he neither liked nor knew the material (relevant because the victim had been killed by someone she met in a chatroom on the subject). This single slip is treated as a decisive victory and the cops immediately take him back into custody as if they now have enough evidence to make an actual case against him.
</li><li> A variation of the old "I'm innocent" vs. "You can't prove that" giveaway is used in another episode when the main character sits down three suspects and declares that he's going to have them fingerprinted to see who accessed a certain company computer. Two of the suspects become visibly upset and protest that of course their fingerprints will be on it because it's a public terminal. The third suspect says, "Go ahead. It'll just prove that I'm innocent," which of course immediately arouses suspicion because only the culprit could know that their fingerprints won't be found.

<ul><li> In "Mr. Monk and the Birds and the Bees", sports agent Rob Sherman has made it look like he shot and killed a burglar who apparently broke into his house and killed his wife (the trick is that he shot the "burglar" with a semi-automatic and the wife with a revolver, then planted the revolver on the "burglar", making great use of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedFallGuyGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedFallGuyGambit">Deceased Fall-Guy Gambit</a>). Monk suspects Sherman is lying because he gave the alleged invader one single shot, instead of unloading his gun on him in a fit of rage and fear like someone would do in a situation like that. Further evidence is that the "burglar" owned a .22 caliber (which he left at home), the revolver found on the body was a .38 caliber, and there is no .38 caliber ammunition in his apartment.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MonkS2E1MrMonkGoesBackToSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MonkS2E1MrMonkGoesBackToSchool">Mr. Monk Goes Back to School</a>," Monk zeroes on science teacher Derek Philby for no other reason than he found evidence he hid his wedding ring in his walletwhich meant he was having an affair and lying about it, making him suspect number one in the death of another teacher whom the police assumed (and Monk couldn't prove otherwise) committed suicide.
</li><li> In another episode, Natalie's parents talk about a couple of friends of theirs who died in a car accident. When Monk hears that the car involved was a British Morgan, he becomes suspicious because the British drive on the left, and this doesn't square with the positions of the bodies at the scene. Apparently, Monk doesn't know that most British car manufacturers, including Morgan, make left-hand-drive versions of their cars for countries that drive on the right.

However is was immediately pointed out that the specified train didn't <em>have</em> a restaurant car, instead being standing buffet only. The suspect attempts to further clarify his alibi, but every attempt to do so is immediately picked apart by the others present as they all seem to posses omniscient knowledge of railway timetables. Stimied at every turn, the son eventually just gives up and confesses to the murder.

<ul><li> Shelby once identified a kidnapping suspect by breaking his alibi; he'd claimed he was at the movies around 8 or so but his ticket stub was for a 5:15. The suspect got irritated that she was going through his things and it was pointed out the evidence was not sufficient to point to his guiltthen he's identified based on his strange habit of drumming his fingers on his briefcase, making the same drumming sound as heard over the kidnapper's ransom call.
</li><li> Another ep had Shelby try to identify a suspect in a smuggling case by the sound of his whistling a particular tune. She told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Da Chief</a> it had to be the musician who performed a concert in town whose song the suspect was whistling; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Da Chief</a> points out that a lot of people attended that concert and would have found the song catchy.

In "The Problem of the Trojan Hamburger", amateur gem cutter Hans Ballpeen is kidnapped and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin">Despair Diamond</a> is stolen afterwards. Ballpeen manages to escape and explains that he was forced to cut the diamond. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Monday and Frankly are more than suspicious because of not one, but a number of contradictions in his account. First, Ballpeen was kidnapped first and then the diamond was stolenit's reasoned that there's no point in kidnapping a gem cutter unless you have one to cut in the first place. Second, Ballpeen claimed he hadn't cut a diamond in years, which made the detectives wonder why someone that rusty would be kidnapped instead of someone more skilled. Third, Ballpeen doesn't identify the diamond as the Despair Diamond. That was considered odd since it was a world-famous diamond. Fourth, he claimed that he was released somewhere in the woods, hiked to a highway, and hitchhiked home. Kate Monday pointed out his boots were pristine and George Frankly reasons that anyone getting away from kidnappers would find first find a phone and call the police.</span>

This was all that kept him from graduating valedictorian. But in the episode "Distant Voices", an alien in Julian's brain points out what viewers with medical training (including writer Rob Wolfe's wife) caught right awaya preganglionic fiber and a postganglionic nerve are nothing alike. The alien accuses Julian of getting it wrong on purpose, which later proves to be true, though for a different reason.

One officer questioned was revealed to have falsified some personal information claiming he had a Vulcan grandfather, when the grandfather was actually Romulan. The witch-hunter who started the hearings took that alone as just-about-proof that he was the spy they were searching for, but Picard and a few other <em>Enterprise</em> officers recognized that while the lie is cause for disciplinary action in and of itself, it didn't prove that he was involved with any kind of deeper conspiracy.
</li><li> Deconstructed in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>: a copy of the Doctor finds himself in a museum seven hundred years into the future, a museum dedicated to the "Voyager incident," which claims the ship caused an entire civilization to be conquered by another race. The Doctor tries to explain what actually happened: Voyager was just making a trade deal for fuel that was misinterpreted to be a weapons deal. The Doctor could prove it wasn't Janeway who shot the first civilization's national hero, but an ambassador from the second race. However, it was pointed out proving who fired a single weapon in what circumstances doesn't really change the broad strokes of the history the "oppressed" civilization <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">wants to maintain</a>. He does succeed in revealing the deception to the general population in the end, though.

She told her friend a minor detail differently (that was not even directly about her rape) and the detectives decide based solely on this that her entire account was made up, pressuring her into recanting (then sticking to it after Marie changes her mind). On top of all that, she's also charged with false reporting, something which is noted by her public defender to be very rare.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>: when a student accuses a popular teacher of sexual assault, Veronica quickly finds several contradictions in her story.

When Sam begins to act like he didn't think there was a problem, CJ preemptively shoots him down, pointing out that he asked both Josh and Toby for advice on the matter, so there's no way he can feign ignorance.

<ul><li> One episode of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheWhistler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheWhistler">The Whistler</a></em> featured a man who killed his wife and made it look like a suicide. The police investigation and interrogation, conducted in the wife's apartment, has some close calls, but it looks like he's gotten away with it. The detective rises and heads for the door, ready to close the book on the case...and the wife's alarm clock goes off. Why would someone who's planning to commit suicide set their alarm clock to wake them up? The detective comes back, and says it's time to restart the interrogation from the top, as the husband breaks down.

<ul><li> A popular (well, often seen) riddle for kids goes like this: The detective is in a hotel room because the hotel's director told him that a famous thief is in the hotel. Then, someone knocks at the door of the detective's room. He opens, and there's a guy, who apologizes: "Sorry, I thought this was my room." The detective arrests him immediately, and guess what, it's really the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a> he was looking for. Oh, the reason? Because nobody will knock on the door of his own roomso the thief must've been checking whether the room was empty and he could plunder it! (Because it couldn't be, let's say, that his wife was in the room, had been taking a shower and he wanted to warn her, in case she wasn't dressed yet, and other people were in the corridor, or that he left the keys in the room while his wife stayed so he had to knock on the doors. Guess the thief is at least guilty of not inventing a good excuse.)
</li><li> Another riddle involves the murder of a wealthy man who is killed on a Sunday. Upon being questioned, all of the servants give various alibis: "I was polishing the silver," "I was mowing the grass," etc. The "killer" is the one who claims to have been checking the mail, because mail isn't delivered on Sundaysbecause apparently, it's impossible to forget that and just check every day out of habit. Or to have forgotten to check on Saturday, and instead get the mail the next day. Or to receive a newspaper that is delivered on Sunday. Or to get mail delivered by others than the Postal Service (how uncommon this is may vary between countries, but that's especially erroneous in the US, since the USPS will deliver letters on Sunday for an extra charge).
</li><li> Yet another one had a woman who was attacked on the walkway leading up to her house, then the robbers tied her and her family up while robbing the place; the detective, arriving an hour later, noticed his long shadow in front of him on the same path and insisted that she was in on the robbery because she hadn't noticed her attacker's shadows behind her.

</li><li> One riddle involves having to figure out why a suspect was let go. It turns out he was deaf, and thus couldn't understand his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirandaRights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirandaRights">Miranda rights</a> when read to him. Aside from the fact that many deaf individuals know how to lip read, the whole idea hinges on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">Hollywood law</a>, as no mention of him confessing is made. Obviously if he confessed the police would quickly have learned of his deafness and made sure his rights were understood, giving them in writing or through a sign language translator if necessary. A deaf person will most likely tell the police immediately they're deaf to facilitate this, if they didn't notice already.

While not on the level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> it's still a ridiculous assumption to make for a while multitude of reasons, particularly since it's only a single shoe size in difference.

During the first round of questions, you find out that one of the two suspects lied, but he's not the murderer and it wouldn't do him justice to accuse him just based on this evidencethe truth is more complicated and can only be found out by repeatedly questioning both suspects and the forensic droid. You can also bypass the whole "logic" aspect and say that you know who did it and that your reasoning is that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Funny/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Funny/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">fat people always lie.</a>"

Although the guilty party usually tells a very blatant lie that makes <em>everything</em> they say untrustworthy, you usually find other physical evidence too. Not so in one case, where a suspected Moon rock theft hinges almost entirely on the thief calling said object a sedimentary rock, despite the player researching in-game that it is physically impossible for a Moon rock to be sedimentary. No other evidence is found to implicate the suspect. (Because if you don't know your basic geology terms, you are clearly a thief.)

Notably, the player cannot use the testimonies of two separate people to contradict one, the other, or both. All lines of questioning are kept separate, and thus those questioned can only ever be called out as a liar for giving self-contradicting testimony. As such, the game does rather well at avoiding any one contradiction resolving the case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with the closest the player character gets to jumping ahead of their evidence being threatening a full-scale investigation against a properly suspicious organization. Even the final contradiction doesn't completely nail the culprit down, with the reveal and arrest coming from an almost off-hand confession</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> has gotten into this trope as of 2016 with players taking the role of police detectives solving the day's latest in the series of "egg murders" taking place at mansions everywhere. Being unable to search for clues or evidence (although some of the <em>suspects</em> are doing so), or indeed take any action other than to wander the scene and interrogate suspects, this follows naturally. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, it's an <em>inversion</em>: most suspects are such pathological liars that if one both fingers a culprit and also correctly tells you even one verifiable fact about the scene or others you can make an arrest. Conviction By Non-Contradiction.</span>
</li><li> In the DOS Game <em>Sleuth</em>, you play a detective investigating a murder in a mansion. There are six suspects each time you play. The ultimate breakdown of their alibis are that two pairs of them will have alibis that substantiate one another, one will claim to be alone, and the last one will have a contradictory alibi. The one with the contradictory alibi is, of course, the murderer.

It was an incredibly minor charge, and the prosecutor was willing to drop it if the defendant would just pay for the cost of replacing the window. However, the defendant swore up and down that he hadn't smashed the window (for extra salience, there was apparently a woman involved, that both the defendant and the window's owner were having sex with), and wanted to go to trial. During pre-trial prep, the public defender noticed that the prosecutor wasn't going to call the police officer that responded to the original complaint, which struck him as odd. He, however, <em>had</em> spoken to the police officer, and he therefore knew that he was going to win the case. He called the officer to the stand (which is extremely rare, for a cop to be called as a witness for the <em>defense</em>), and asked if the owner of the window had allowed the officer into the room with the smashed window. Well, no, replied the officer. Alright, did you get to see the paint can? Well, no, replied the officer. Did you get to see the shattered window? Yes, the officer replied, but only from outside. And where was the broken glass? Well, replied the officer, it was on the <em>outside</em> of the window...
