</p><p>Why someone would target the descendants rather than the one who originally did the wrong tends to vary, but it's usually due to the original offender not being alive enough to go after and make suffer. Or that the descendant benefitted (or still benefits) from his ancestors' crimes; the money grandfather stole allowed the father to go to medical school, which allowed son to grow up in comfortable circumstances; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">therefore, son deserves to be punished for grandfather's theft.</a> This is especially true of villains who are immortal or undead, or many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>, whose hatreds can take years if not decades or centuries to fester and grow. More often than not, this form of revenge is pursued by villains rather than heroes, since targeting someone other than the person who actually committed the wrong, and who may not have anything to do with it aside from being descended from the person who did is a good way to wind up on the wrong side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfEmpathy">Rule of Empathy</a>.

The villain may justify it on the grounds that the children profited by the original crime, particularly when they own something that belonged to the villain. Repeated instances of this occurring between two families in a tit-for-tat fashion may lead to a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">blood feud between them</a>.

A young Grisha Yeager decried this oppression, pointing out the unfairness of punishing subsequent generations for the crimes of people long dead. In comparison, most Eldian children are raised to believe it is their duty to atone for their ancestors' crimes by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sacrificing their lives as soldiers and Warriors for Marley's war machine</span>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, Char plots the deaths of the Zabi family — including youngest son Garma, his best friend from military academy — because he's convinced their father, Sovereign Degwin, murdered his father. It starts out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">Revenge by Proxy</a>, with Char killing the Zabis to make Degwin suffer, but he continues on after Degwin's death (at the hands of eldest son, Gihren), pushing him into this territory.
</li><li> It should be noted that, outside of Garma, the only Zabi Char directly killed was Kycilia, which he did more to end the Zabis' reign of terror as opposed to avenge his father. Dozle was killed by Amuro at the Battle of Solomon, Degwin was killed by Gihren's "accidental" firing of the Solar Ray, and Gihren himself was killed by Kycilia in the middle of A Bao A Qu. In that sense, Char only invoked the trope with Garma (which ironically was enough to torment Degwin, who loved Garma the most, to his grave), whereas the rest were casualties of war (Dozle) or just had it coming over their own sins (Gihren, Degwin, and Kycilia).

To summarize, Rau hates Mu because he (Rau) is a faulty clone of his father (whose reason for creating Rau was to create a successor in his own literal image), he hates Kira because <em>his</em> father was the geneticist in charge of the project (which he used to fuel the Ultimate Coordinator program) and he hates everybody else because he feels humanity condoned his creation through the rampant genetic engineering of the Cosmic Era.

Unfortunately, the manner in which Vorian is "killed" is cowardly and backhanded, only infuriating the young Atreides. So when he and Valya's little brother end up courtiers to Emperor Roderick, it's the Atreides who ends up rekindling the feud, seeking retribution for the murders of Vorian and his brother earlier.

Some of Herc's other Olympian relatives also resent Zeus favoring a half-mortal over them and treat Hercules as a scapegoat to take their anger out on.

Here, Worf's late father, Mogh, is accused of treason, but only to cover up the fact Duras' powerful clan was responsible to avoid civil war. The Klingon High Council figured that since his only known relation was Worf, a Federation citizen, then Worf would be safe from any punishment this judgment would bring. Unfortunately, they underestimate how much value Worf places in his Klingon heritage, including his honor; the dishonor may have no <em>practical</em> implications, but that doesn't mean Worf is going to let it slide (though he eventually agrees to go along with it anyway for the greater good of the Empire).
</li><li> Played with in the case of Duras. Worf clearly wants revenge on Duras, for Duras' father framing Worf's father for treason. He does not directly challenge him, as with Duras dead, Worf would never have the proof to regain his honor. Then Duras kills Worf's mate (and Alexander's mother) K'ehleyr...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">and Worf promptly shoves a bat'leth through his chest in single-combat</a>.

Worf declines, pointing out that unlike his grandfather, father, and aunts, he has committed no crime.
</li><li> It is also mentioned in a couple episodes that the dishonor for certain crimes in Klingon culture is passed down for a certain number of generations. Worf actually lies about the heritage of the children of Klingon POWs that he discovered because allowing oneself to be captured shames the family for three generations, meaning that said children, and any future children they might have, would be tainted in Klingon society for their parent's perceived sins.

Chancellor Gowron strips Worf's family honor when Worf refuses to side with the Empire against the Federation. Worf is willing to accept that because he feels that, whatever the Empire's official position, betraying his oath would be a <em>true</em> dishonor. Unfortunately, the fallout also affects Worf's brother Kurn, and he is <em>not</em> happy, asking Worf to put him out of his miseryas even in committing dishonorable suicide, Kurn claims he would find himself among other Klingons. Worf is eventually forced to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have Kurn's memory modified to the point he cannot remember his own name or Worf's, and he asks a friend of their father to take Kurn into his House under a new identity</span>.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, the penalty of breaking #2 of the Ten Commandments (worshiping an idol or a false god), is that God will descend his punishment unto you, and your descendants up until the fourth generation.

This was later overturned in the book of Jeremiah, since it was no longer having the intended effect (people thought only descendants would be punished).

</li><li> God did prohibit the execution of the wrong generation for the sins of a member of one generation, decreeing that each is to die only for their own sins. King Amaziah of Judah lays down this law when dealing with the two men that murdered his father (who had in his later years morally degenerated, but still).
</li><li> Once, Noah...overindulged a little on the wine made from the first grapes produced after the Deluge. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantHoldHisLiquor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantHoldHisLiquor">He got naked...and passed out.</a> His son, Ham, noticed and decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny">point and laugh</a> before informing his brothers (who covered him up, averting their eyes all the while). When he woke up and found out, Noah blessed his two other sons...and cursed Ham's <em>grandson</em>, saying that those descended from him would be destined to serve those of Ham's brothers.
</li><li> And we have David's son in 2 Samuel, conceived by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAdulteryBadAdultery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAdulteryBadAdultery">Bathsheba, the wife of one of his soldiers,</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">pulling</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">Murder the Hypotenuse</a> in the bargain.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus">Book of Exodus</a></em>, if a man died with no heirs, and he had a brother, his widow was to be married off to his brother (whether she wanted to be or not), and the first son they had together would be counted as her <em>original</em> husband's heir, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather">the family line would continue.</a> All others would be considered to belong to her new husband. This levirate marriage custom was considered to be an honor and a privilege, as well as a duty. And if a man's brother refused to marry the widow, she was permitted to spit in his face and remove his sandal in front of the entire community. He would face financial ruin and social ostracism, and all his descendants would be known as "the sons/daughters of The Unsandaled". No word on what would happen if the widow tried to refuse the levirate marriage, but since women were typically uneducated and economically dependent on the men in their lives, and besides, this was a matter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyHonor">Family Honor</a>, it most likely would not have been in <em>her</em> best interests to do so, either.

<ul><li> It's not like the Orks to complain about an inexhaustible source of fresh battle, and they also avert this trope for the same reason, and more so: killing Orks makes them release a lot of spores, that might otherwise come out only much later, if ever. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Don't expect them to thank you, though,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">except with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a>.

</li><li> Played straight, and self-inflicted, on the Death Korps of Krieg.

The only way for a casteless family to change this is if a casteless has a child with a dwarf with a caste and the child is the same gender as the parent with a caste.

Sticks herself was upset because Jebediah represents everything she hates about the government. The villagers apologize after Sticks saves them from another of Eggman's schemes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, there is an entire large set of episodes named this.
<ul><li> That was the season that dealt with Mary Jane's father, Harry's father, Peter's parents, and Felicia's father. It might have even mentioned Alistair Smythe's father. Peter's parents <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">were found out to be spies. At first, Peter thought they were Russian spies, but they turned out to be double agents working for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a>. Harry was dealing with his dad being the Green Goblin, and he became the Green Goblin for a while. Felicia's father turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar">Classy Cat-Burglar</a> who had the super soldier serum memorized, and taught Felicia all he knew in being a burglar after giving her the serum</span>.
</li><li> And then there's Wilson Fisk (Kingpin) and his son, Richard. Kingpin's backstory involves him taking a prison sentence to avoid implicating his father in a robbery gone south, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">taking his revenge later</a>. Naturally, Richard ends up going to prison to save Kingpin, who's left wondering how long it will take for history to repeat.
</li><li> Kingpin also killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Matt Murdock's</a> father to keep him from spilling the beans about his toxic waste smuggling operation.
</li><li> There's also Carnage, who's not on good terms with his "father" Venom, causing Venom's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em>: Richie Foley never had his friend visit him because his father was a racist. When Virgil's sister pointed out how often Richie visited them and that Virgil never visited him, Richie had no choice but to schedule a visit and hope his father wasn't around. He wasn't so lucky. Fortunately Virgil didn't hold it against Richie and Mr. Foley eventually changed his mind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a complicated case of this: Rose Quartz led the Crystal Gems in their rebellion against Homeworld to save Earth and her comrades. Much later, to give birth to Steven, Rose gave up her form and Steven inherited her gem — which no other gem did before. Now, Rose's enemies want to get back at her by punishing Steven. However, since Gems' forms are essentially projections from their gem, which Rose passed onto Steven, said enemies think Steven literally <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity">is</a></strong> Rose. And then it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose did not actually do what Homeworld hates her for in the first place (the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a> for them is because Rose supposedly shattered Pink Diamond). She did not shatter Pink Diamond...she <strong>is</strong> Pink Diamond</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Spinel</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie">Steven Universe: The Movie</a></em> is a straighter example: She was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pink Diamond's/Rose Quartz's "court jester" back on Homeworld who was left behind and forgotten for <em>6000</em> years and waited all that time believing that Pink would come back</span>. When she learns via galaxy-wide broadcast that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pink started a rebellion, faked her death, and then gave up her existence to create Steven</span>, she slams right past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> and decides to wipe out all life on Earth for it. Spinel <em>knows</em> Steven and Rose are two separate people unlike most antagonistic Homeworld Gems, but Spinel's grudge is against <em>everything</em> on Earth in general (not simply Steven) and thus it's all fair game with Rose gone.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">Unfortunately common in the real world</a>, as generations of Hatfields and McCoys and other families around the world who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">carried down feuds through generations</a> can attest.
</li><li> The effects of wars can last for quite a long time, sometime forming part of the justification for a later war, or leading to one or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">both</a> sides continuing to nurse resentment long after combat ends. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> had economic effects that continue to linger. The South was already at a severe economic disadvantage by most metrics when the war began, but the Total War policies that brought it to a close devastated much of the existing industry and predatory practices after the war exacerbated the effects. To this day, former Confederate states are generally behind the rest of the country in economic and health statistics, though other factors have come into play by now, and there is considerable lingering resentment in the South at their situation. It's the proximate cause of the infamous Hatfield-McCoy feud, since the families fought on opposite sides in the war, with a legal dispute later sparking decades of bloodshed.
</li><li> The Transatlantic Slave Trade. Quite often, an apology is made which goes something along the lines of "I'm sorry that my great-grandfather enslaved your great-grandfather." Understandably so, as this is the truth, though this practice has morphed in recent years to more about civil rights treatments, which many still feel aren't completely equal. Unfortunately this has become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">Flame Bait</a> because of differing opinions on whose fault everything seems to be.
<ul><li> One specific aspect of this that crops up from time to time is the idea of "reparations". It's a rather controversial topic, as trying to figure out who owes what to whom is an effectively impossible task.
</li></ul></li><li> The punishment for high treason in Imperial China is referred to as the "nine exterminations" — execution of the criminal along with all of his relatives down to the ninth degree (by Chinese reckoning).
<ul><li> Execution of relatives to the third, fifth, and seventh degree was eventually added (and taken up by some other East Asian countries as well, such as Vietnam, Korea, and Japan). There was even a case of <em>tenth</em> degree executions, the only officially designated example of such: Reportedly, Fang Xiaoru (the guilty party) indulged in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Tempting Fate</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmiteMeOMightySmiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmiteMeOMightySmiter">Smite Me, O Mighty Smiter!</a> by saying he was fine with a tenth-degree execution. The Yongle Emperor Zhu Di (who charged Fang with lèse-majesté for calling him an usurper, which is a death-penalty crime) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28skp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note28skp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28skp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which of course Yongle is guilty of, since his father the Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang declared his grandson Zhu Yunwen as his heir; Yongle seized the throne in a coup known as the Jingnan Incident.</span> got pissed off and decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">grant the wish</a>. In addition to Fang, his blood relations and their spouses were killed along with all of his students and peers as the 10th group. 873 people are said to have been executed in all.
</li><li> Vietnam's most notable case only extended to the third degree: In 1442, Nguyễn Trãi (a founding father of the Lê dynasty who had fallen out of favor) was made an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">Un-person</a> and executed with three generations of his family after he and his wife were charged with murdering Emperor Lê Thái Tông. It was revoked after Emperor Lê Thánh Tông absolved him. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yiqk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3yiqk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yiqk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Theories abound to this day as to why the executions happened, and why the charges were revoked. One of them was that Lê Thái Tông died of malaria or some other sickness, and the court seized the chance to get rid of a troublesome influence and to put Lê Thánh Tông on the throne in one fell swoop. The new Emperor might have known why it happened, but refused to publicize the exact reason to maintain his family reputation.</span> Nguyễn Thị Lộ, Nguyễn Trãi's wife, who stayed up all night with the Emperor on the night he died, was never officially pardoned by the court. She was painted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth">Lady Macbeth</a> by feudal historians. This lasted until 2004, when a comprehensive account of her position in the affair was published and completely exonerated her of murder.
</li></ul></li><li> Attainder is an old English legal concept where parliament passes a bill to execute a political enemy, as well as strip them of their titles and lands. Attainder also worked a corruption of blood, such that nothing could pass from the attained to their heirs or pass through the attained, such that later inheritances would skip their family. This was so abused in the English Civil War that the US Constitution specifically bans it. It's since also been abolished in both England and Wales.
</li><li> Even 70 years after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> ended, current German citizens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis">still have to deal with their nation being mocked</a> (and in some cases, hated) by other countries due to the actions of the Nazis, but fortunately it is fading out ever so slowly.
<ul><li> Perhaps worse if you're Japanese, which is why they tend to pretend the whole thing never happened. Sino-Japanese and Korean-Japanese relations still suffer from this, especially what the Japanese did in cities like Nanking (e.g. lined up the locals to see how many heads they could chop off before tiring). This is less prevalent in Southeast Asia, though, despite having suffered their own share of atrocities.
</li><li> Italian relationships with Libya, Croatia and Slovenia suffer from the war crimes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FascistItaly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FascistItaly">Fascist Italy</a> against them...and the retaliation the Yugoslav Partisans took on Italian civilians when the tide turned.
</li><li> After formerly occupied countries were liberated, people took to punishing children fathered by SS officers with local women for their years of suffering during the war — children of the so called "Lebensborn" programs set up in Norway, for example, became especially popular targets, since all of the people who actually <em>were</em> responsible for their ordeals were already dead or incarcerated. Such children tended to be ostracized and heaped with absolutely horrific abuse, and this was <em>openly encouraged</em> by the governments of said countries, who remain largely unapologetic to this day. Understandably, many of these unfortunate children grew up very bitter and angry, over being punished for having the <em>audacity</em> to be born.
</li></ul></li><li> When it comes to the Red Terror and its atrocities (like Holodomor) many are aware of the Russians, and some claim that the Jews were a high percentage of the Communist revolutionaries (they were actually a small percentage, but anti-semitic theories then and now say differently).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a>, an offense that results in exile to a prison camp means not only the offender being sent off, but also their entire family. Not only that, but any children born in a prison camp remain there for life, as do <em>their</em> children. <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes">60 Minutes</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korean-prisoner-escaped-after-23-brutal-years-15-05-2013/">interviewed a defector<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who had been born in a labor camp, to parents imprisoned there due to <em>his grandfather's</em> supposed offenses, which occurred in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">The Korean War</a>.
</li><li> When Norway wished to celebrate their bicentennial as a "free nation", the Norwegian government invited the Danish monarch, who gladly obliged, and the Swedish monarch, who refused to attend the celebration. Why? Because his great-great-great-great grandfather was the Swedish king-to-be who didn't quite get around to accepting the Norwegian constitution in the first place. The story shows that after six generations of Swedish kings, and a successful Scandinavian partnership, Sweden hadn't forgiven completely. When the Swedish king changed his mind, it was after some public pressure from forces in the Swedish society who decided that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">bygones -- after all -- were bygones.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> received some harassment when it was revealed his father had been a member of the Nazi Party and SS. It ended when the Simon Wiesenthal Center did some research and showed there was no evidence of his father committing any atrocities (not that he would have any control over it either way).
</li><li> Almost a thousand years on, Muslim extremists continue to use the Crusades as an excuse to hate Christians and the West, while radical atheists still harp on them as an example of Christian hypocrisy and wrongdoing, far, far past the point where the identities of the majority of people actually involved have already been lost to history. On the counter side many Westerners aren't willing to forgive the Muslim world for the consecutive invasions and dominion of Europe prior to the crusades and for the Arab slave trade. Further, the Shiites still bear a grudge for their defeat at the hands of the Sunnis early in Islamic history, with annual holidays mourning them to this day, along with their martyred leaders being lionized.
</li><li> A general rule of law is that children cannot be forced to pay the debts of their parents after their parent has died (although the children may be out of a portion, or all, of their parent's inheritance as a result). However, that doesn't stop creditors from coming after children and trying to convince the children that they do have to pay for their deceased parent's debts and convince the children to sign agreements which put them on the hook.
</li><li> Children of stateless parents (i.e. people without citizenship) are usually themselves stateless, meaning they have difficulty getting any kind of visa to enter or leave countries. However, statelessness outside of birth is often due to discrimination, the dissolution of whatever nation the parent was a part of, some legal circumstance that disqualifies a person for citizen, or some other happenstance outside of the control of the stateless parents, although sometimes it is for their acts.
</li><li> It is an ongoing controversy among the pro-life community whether an exception can be made to abort children when their conception is due to rape so as to spare the victim further trauma from being reminded of the harm done to her, or if doing so is unjustly punishing the innocent child for the father's undeniably heinous crime. 
</li><li> NASCAR driver Conor Daly was dropped by his sponsors in 2018 after it emerged that his father, himself a former NASCAR driver, had used a racial profanity three decades earlier.
