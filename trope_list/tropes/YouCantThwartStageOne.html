<ul><li> In Part 1, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dio successfully becomes a vampire and begins his plans for world domination.</span>
</li><li> In Part 2, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kars acquires the Red Stone of Aja, which he had spent the whole arc trying to get, and becomes the Ultimate Life Form.</span>

"Almost" doesn't cut it, though, as Precia executes her plans anyway with what she has no matter how unstable it is, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector">Masked Man</a> intervenes and uses the Wolkenritter's essence</span> as fuel for the remaining pages of the Book of Darkness, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">the Numbers</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">invade and destroy the heroes' HQ</a></span> to reclaim the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif">Mysterious Waif</a> respectively.
<ul><li> <em>FORCE</em> uses this too, but the manga's cancellation means Stage One is all there is. That Stage One lasted for four years with no end in sight is often cited as a reason for said cancellation.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> manga's Kyoto arc, not only did Negi fail to thwart Stage One — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stopping bad guys from kidnapping Konoka</span>, he also failed to thwart Stage Two — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saving Konoka to stop the Demon God from being summoned</span> — and even failed in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">defeating the said Demon God after it was summoned</span>.

<ul><li> Similarily in the immediately following Festival arc, Negi lost the entire game and only rectified that through the use of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">time travel.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the Dark Tournament arc is revealed to have a plan to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">make a portal to the demon world</span>, but it stopped when he was still trying to amass sufficient funds. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the villains of the <em>next</em> arc have the same plan, but already have the means to do so</span>.
<ul><li> The Chapter Black saga also mostly plays it straight, as the heroes fail to prevent Kuwabara from being kidnapped, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fail to stop the opening of the portal, and destroy the barrier themselves. While they prevent a demon invasion, they learn that they were playing into Sensui's alternate plan</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, during the Water 7 arc, the Straw Hats try to get <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Robin</span> to come back to the crew on several occasions, but fail each attempt due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">CP9 threatening the Straw Hats with the Buster Call, which prevents her from coming back</span>. It takes them breaking into the heavily defended Enies Lobby, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">convincing Robin she's one of them</span> and saving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> just before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she</span> is to be taken beyond their reach.
<ul><li> Similarly, in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Impel Down</span> arc, Luffy doesn't manage to save <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ace inside Impel Down</span>, but has to go all the way to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marine Headquarters</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He ultimately fails, despite managing to free Ace from the execution platform.</span>
</li><li> Also the case with Blackbeard's plans, which go off without a hitch all the way through killing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Whitebeard, stealing his Devil Fruit power, and taking his place as one of the Four Emperors</span>. This is even lampshaded by Blackbeard and his crew often talking about fate's role in their plan, as if recognizing that this trope would come into effect.
</li><li> This is usually the formula in many arcs, where, despite attempts, the villain's plan progresses as intended and is only ruined in the final stage when Luffy defeats them, most notably in the Alabasta arc.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: During the TBTP flashback mini-arc, Yoruichi challenges Urahara to develop the best-case solution to the worst-case scenario when they face exile and abandonment because of Aizen's machinations. The first half of the storyline is therefore a chess-game where Aizen always reaches the worst case scenario so that Urahara can come up with a best-case scenario to solve the situation. Once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> is activated, the indications are that the chess-game has switched villainous players from Aizen to Yhwach, leaving Urahara still planning the best solutions to the worst case scenarios. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's eventually confirmed that Urahara is classified as one of the Five Special War Powers precisely because of his ability to devise a thousand different options for any given potential event.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, an alternative Rogue Cheney arrives from the future to help Hisui open Eclipse during the Grand Magic Games so that the dragons from the past would invade Fiore.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Father plans on using Amestris to make a philosopher stone, like he did with Xerxes 400 years ago, which requires tunnels being dug throughout the countries, bloody battles taking place at critical points on the circle, and five people who have opened the gate being gathered. The presence of Pride makes destroying the tunnels impossible, so the heroes plan on defeating Father before "The Promised Day" arrives. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During the siege of Central, Father manages to gather Hohenheim, Ed, Al, Izumi, and Roy as his sacrifices</span>. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, as the centuries-old plan was already nearing the final stage when Ed and Al were born. Technically speaking, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the plan is never thwarted at all — it's reversed <em>after</em> being completed.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Raideen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Raideen">Chouja Reideen</a></em>, the heroes are completely unable to stop the Chouma from gathering the Zodiac Orbs by the simple problem of the fact that they don't even know they <em>exist</em>, much less that the enemy is gathering them.

However, the only strong characters have chronic cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> and typically let the enemy <em>get</em> to their maximum power so that there's no doubt of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours">who's the strongest when it's over.</a>
</li><li> Subverted in the Frieza arc, as although Frieza was allowed to power up to full by the heroes, he never got to wish for immortality (his actual goal). Okay, technically he did, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory">the opportunity meant nothing to him because he couldn't speak the right language.</a>
</li><li> The Buu Saga, wherein Goku and Vegeta, who were at least twice as strong as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> and hundreds of times stronger than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, not only failed to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Majin Buu's revival</a> but agreed to cause it so they they could settle their infighting.

</li><li> At the end of the Cell arc, Future Trunks also killed Future Cell after destroying the Androids thus preventing Cell from reaching his stronger forms. He also killed Present Cell before he could awaken. In general, Future Trunks is the subversion that does things the sensible way in this franchise, though mostly off-screen or as an afterthought.
</li><li> In the Future Trunks arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> Goku and Beerus make a spirited effort at thwarting Stage One by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Present Zamasu before he could kill his mentor Gowasu and become Goku Black</span>. This works out without a hitch, until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Black shows up again and reveals that his Time Ring made him immune to changes in the past, so while there is now a new timeline in which Zamasu died before he could do anything, the Goku Black version of Zamasu still exists</span>. After all's said and done, Whis also goes to thwart Stage One by warning Future Beerus of the threat, though it's acknowledged that this isn't so much undoing the damage as creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline">Close-Enough Timeline</a> where the problem didn't happen.
</li><li> Zig-zagged all over the place with the Cell Arc. The story begins with Future Trunks unceremoniously shredding Frieza and all his forces before they could carry out their planned revenge, and Dr. Gero, the person behind all the threats of the arc, is unceremoniously killed off shortly into it. Afterwards, however, Cell plays this straight when he is allowed to reach his Perfect form because Vegeta got cocky. Later, the story reveals that Cell is in the main timeline because his Future Trunks <em>did</em> thwart Stage One by killing Androids 17 and 18 before he could absorb them, necessitating his time travel (via killing Future Trunks and stealing his time machine) back to an era where they still lived. Present Cell is thwarted at stage <em>zero</em>- Krillin destroys him long before he could awaken. And at the end of the arc, the Cell from Future Trunks' timeline is also thwarted at stage one, as the now much stronger Trunks returns and kills both him and the androids.

<ul><li> Each season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> has the villains' plans succeed to some extent:
<ul><li> In the first season, the plan to kill Teri Bauer succeeds while the Palmer assassination fails.
</li><li> Season 2 has the bomb go off, even though only Mason is killed. This is significant because Palmer is forced to follow through on his threat that if the bomb goes off on U.S. soil, he will wage war against the people responsible.
</li><li> In season 3, hundreds of people are infected with the virus, although a <strike>city</strike> nation-wide epidemic is averted.
</li><li> In season 4, one nuclear meltdown succeeds, and Keeler is incapacitated and possibly killed after Air Force One is shot down.
</li><li> In season 5, the gas attack on the shopping mall partly succeeds, as does the attack on CTU headquarters.
</li><li> In season 6, 12,000 people are killed by a suitcase nuke in Valencia, California.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> In season 1, the confrontation itself triggers the final phase, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> needs Buffy's blood to give him the strength to set his plan in motion.
</li><li> In season 2, Angel actually gets as far as awakening Acathla, who begins to suck the world into hell, forcing Buffy to sacrifice a now resouled Angel in order to seal the rift.
</li><li> In season 3, by the time they figure out who the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <em>is</em>, he's completed a ritual that makes him invincible until he's ready to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a>. (In this case, the Scoobies do actually capture an artifact required for the ritual, but, in doing so, Willow was taken hostage by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Wesley argued that they should accept Willow as lost and destroy the artifact there and then, but in the end, the Scoobies traded it for their friend.)
</li><li> Season 4 is a subversion of this trope. Adam was potentially the most dangerous foe that Buffy ever faced, but they managed to kill him before he secured a powerbase. If he had succeeded and gained the resources of The Initiative, then they would've really been in trouble!
</li><li> Season 5: One of Glory's minions opened the portal home before Glory was defeated.
</li><li> Season 6: Short answer: Yes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Willow</span> is seconds away from destroying the world. Long Answer: No. The trio of nerds were the main villains for most of Season 6, only a handful of their plans even got past Stage 1, and none of them really went the way they anticipated (leading up to a frustrated Warren just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">going to buy a freaking gun</a>...).
</li><li> Season 7: Short answer: again, yes, most of the major events of Season 7 go the way they do in order to have the climatic battle at the end. (And the span of human history leading up to it, according to the First Evil.) Longer answer: the season went mostly according to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plans, but Buffy took it off the rails before the invasion was scheduled to begin. It all still came down to an all-or-nothing final battle with everything on the line, but it was done on the Slayers' timeline before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> could open the Hellmouth and have the army of super-vampires start pouring out. The word "plan" is used loosely, as it seems to consist of little more than "screw with Buffy's head". Probably a result of the writers designing an omniscient, omnipresent villain with "unlimited resources" and still trying to make the show dramatic. By the final episode, even the writers had to lampshade how useless the First Evil was for all of their supposed power.

Hawkeye sees a friend die in the O.R., which devastates him.

Over the course of an entire season, the <em>Enterprise</em> doggedly and valiantly track the Xindi effort to build and launch their Sealed Death Star in a Can. However, no matter what they do, they cannot stop the Xindi from launching the device. For bonus points, the Xindi open one of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">spatial rifts</a> which enable them to cross the distance from their part of space to Earth in something like 4 hours. Note, it took the Warp-5 <em>Enterprise</em> months to reach the area.

<ul><li> In Season 1, the Winchesters corner Azazel but fail to kill him, allowing him to continue his plan for Sam.
</li><li> In Season 2, they are seconds too late to stop the Hell gate opening, and while they close it, over 200 demons still escape from Hell.
</li><li> In Season 3, Lilith succeeds in dragging Dean to Hell, which opens the first seal to start the Apocalypse.
</li><li> In Season 4, the main characters are attempting to prevent various seals from being broken and thus preventing the end times. It didn't go well. Sam is tricked into killing Lilith by Ruby, unwittingly breaking Lucifer's seal and releasing him onto Earth.
</li><li> In Season 5, Lucifer succeeds in hijacking Sam's body, but in a subversion of this trope, Dean manages to snap him out of it long enough for Sam to throw himself and Lucifer into Hell.

You have a few encounters with the villains, during which they set up their plans and, thanks to GM fiat, escape or muck up the heroes' plans.

On the other hand, there is a power under Luck Control that allows the PCs to cancel Villain Points, effectively telling the GM, "No, you do <em>not</em> get to escape this one!"
</li><li> Interestingly, the inverse system used by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em> leads to the same metagame: players start each gaming session with poker chips, and can earn some more in a variety of ways. These chips can be used at any time to get bonuses on rolls, or reroll failed actions, or negate injuries etc... However, whenever a player uses a chip, the GM gets one, to be used on NPC actions. So, while using chips early in the story to stop Mooks or avoid an injury might seem like a good idea at the time, it WILL come back to bite the PCs in the ass. Trust me, pilgrim: let the outlaws rob the bank. Take the sucking chest wound. Use 'em chips when you know who the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is, and are drawing a bead on his noggin'. No sooner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea">7th Sea</a></em> has Drama Dice, which work roughly the same. But of course, the entire point is heroism and general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> behavior, so you really ought to hold out for the supervillain.
</li><li> A similar dynamic exists in basically every incarnation of the FATE system. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> in particular makes it explicit that powerful characters (including wizards like Harry), on account of having a low refresh and thus starting out with potentially no more than one lonely fate point to their name when a scenario unfolds, basically <em>have</em> to earn more the "hard" way by accepting setbacks and rolling with the punches as best they can in order to eventually have enough to help wrap up the plot.
</li><li> This can occur in any game system where the PCs gain experience and level, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">but the villain or villains don't</a>. The first time they meet their enemy, the heroes are outclassed. By the climax, they have gained more skill and gear, and can face their foes on a more even footing. It can be averted if the PCs outmaneuver the GM. Usually causes the session to end early.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Masks of Nyarlathotep</a></em>, where the game is structured in such a way that it's actually entirely possible to stop certain aspects of various cults' plans <em>before</em> they are supposed to be launched if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Investigators</a> go to the right places first. For example, if they choose to go to Shanghai (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">the canonical end game</a>), they can potentially <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Penhew's</a> rocket on Grey Dragon Island long before the launch date</span>.

</li><li> This is an important part of the flavour of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer40000</a></em>. The Empire and Imperium are the preeminent powers in their respective settings, with enough resources available that they will always eventually defeat whatever evil scheme they're currently facing. But consistently failing to defeat stage one of said schemes means their strength is slowly but surely being drained while their enemies grow stronger - every Chaos invasion may be beaten back, but the Chaos Wastes advance a little further each time.

<ul><li> Cia and Ganondorf each get their hands on the full Triforce and its infinite, reality-warping power early on in their respective arcs before somehow still being defeated by the heroes.
</li><li> On a smaller scale, Sequence Breaking is nigh impossible in Legend Mode; if you manage to bypass the enemies to get to the "main" target of the scenario (i.e. Wizzro in the first scenario of the Prologue), they'll quickly disappear to prolong things until the necessary storywise events have occurred (i.e. King Dodongo has appeared)
</li><li> This also happens in some Adventure Mode battles, combined with an unusual variation of You Shouldn't Know This Already: In many of them, you have to complete a mission, and are then told to find a boss key in a specific keep to access the overall boss of the battle; it is very possible to get the key early but the key won't work until you complete the starting mission.

The first time is during the climax of the Horizon mission, wherein Shepard decides to attack the Collector Ship using the colony's planetary defense cannons, but fails to destroy the ship. The second time, Shepard is actually on board the Collector Ship as the Illusive Man has sent them there to gather intel, despite knowing that it's a trap. The third time, a virus embedded in the Reaper IFF disables the ship weaponry, and Shepard decided to take the shuttle, preventing them from being able to do anything about it.

This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a> scenario means that the world would've been screwed regardless of whether Solid Snake succeeded or failed.

However, this gets you a bad ending, since the plot never had a chance to get underway and as a result you never were able to piece together exactly what the hell was going on in the first place.
<ul><li> More importantly, in the Bad ending, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Nick Kang</a> loses his job for accidentally killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> (or letting him die) and remains bitter for not finding closure.

When playing as Chris, you come across Wesker fighting Lisa Trevor. He'll say "Chris! Take a piece of the action!" when he sees you, and you fight her off together. However, Wesker can get knocked into the abyss by Lisa's attacks. If he does so, he'll <em>still</em> appear unscathed during the final battle, with no explanation.
<ul><li> This <em>started</em> as a subversion, though. Originally, this actually would have killed Wesker, and you'd have gotten an entirely different ending. For whatever reason, the developers decided against it, and <em>forgot to remove the line of code that allowed Wesker to be knocked off the edge</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Blizzard seems to enjoy this trope as a means for making proper drama.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>, the chronological order of the campaign is Terran -&gt; Zerg -&gt; Protoss, with the Terrans introducing most of the cast and the threat of the Zerg, the Zerg campaign having them run rampant over most of the galaxy, and the Protoss managing to barely pull off a last second victory despite a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fully manifested Overmind on the surface of Aiur</span>.
<ul><li> Subverted in the <em>Brood War</em> expansion, as the order is changed to Protoss -&gt; Terran -&gt; Zerg, with the Protoss simply doing their best to survive in their campaign, the Terrans introducing the new UED antagonists and succeeding much like the Zerg before them... and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kerrigan betrays <em>everyone</em> and the Zerg finish the game as the pre-eminent power in the Sector, with only Kerrigan's mercy holding them from overrunning her former allies she used to bring down the UED.</span>

<ul><li> And much like <em>StarCraft</em> before it, <em>Frozen Throne</em> starts with the Night Elves dealing with the aftermath of the first game, moves on to the Alliance campaign setting up Illidan's powerbase, and then ends with Arthas <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">beating all comers around the titular <em>Frozen Throne</em> before putting on Ner'Zul's armor and becoming the Lich King, with the unlimited power the position entails no longer kept in check by the Throne's prison.</span>

Never mind that you and everyone else that matters in the Kingdom know which exact artefacts need to be protected in order to prevent that occurrence, and where these are; they get destroyed anyway.

If you are quick enough and clever enough, it's actually possible to escape this ambush and make it back to a friendly town, where you're safe. But the plot requires you to be captured, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> will just keep trying every night until he succeeds.

Your commander even admits that he's impressed, but he doesn't want to see you try anything that stupid again. Of course, over the span of the game, your space fighter gets weapons upgrades that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>-level improvements... Which in no way affect the game's storyline or allow you to rescue or otherwise impact the story in any meaningful way. Even when you're regularly wiping out entire enemy fleets, your own fleet will still be desperately on the run.

Near the start of the game, your character, Renko, is thrown 50 years into the past — going from a destroyed building to a building on fire. Coming across someone trapped in the fire, Renko saves him, then jumps back into the present — where he (Dr. Demichev) has taken control of the world. Unfortunately, if you try to kill Demichev or leave him to die, the game will end.</span>
<ul><li> This is explained by the endgame. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After fighting through Demichev's troops, Renko manages to create a bomb powerful enough to destroy the island's reactor — he detonates it in the past. When he comes back to the present, Demichev is waiting for him in front of an <em>operational reactor</em>. He says that it was pointless to destroy the reactor — he just rebuilt it. Dr. Raikov, a supporter of yours, then says that the problem with the time loop wasn't the reactor, but Demichev — since you rescued him from the fire. Demichev then says that <em>you've already tried killing him in the past, and it changed nothing</em> - as evidenced by notes scrawled on the wall by someone who turns out to be <em>Renko</em>. Raikov then realizes that the only way to stop the loop is to destroy the one thing not present in the original timestream — Renko.</span>

In many games, Sonic tries to stop some evil from being released or brought to full power (or in one case, the Chaos Emeralds from being collected, which unbeknownst to him and Eggman, releases an evil anyway). Said plot goes underway anyway despite his best efforts, and the final boss is him going Super Sonic to face the unleashed evil and bring peace to the world again.

Doubly subverted, though, in regards to Eggman's plans to rebuild the Death Egg. Sonic's victory at the Launch Base causes the Death Egg to crash down to Angel Island in destruction before it can be launched into orbit (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadBearingBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadBearingBoss">...somehow</a>), but Eggman still succeeds at rebuilding it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">AGAIN</a> and successfully launching it and stowing the Master Emerald inside.
</li><li> It's most egregious in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em>, as you spend large amounts of the game searching for Chaos Emeralds at a snail's pace, and Eggman (or rather, Chaos) succeeds at getting every single one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The last Chaos Emerald, hidden in Tails' Tornado and being used as a power source, lands in the Hidden Ruins at the end of the game.

As a result, the events of <em>Calamity Trigger</em> play out to Terumi's advantage without exception. <br/><em>Continuum Shift</em>, however, is quite a bit more complicated. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Takamagahara set a new backup point after the time loop broke to more directly control affairs and carry out its plans, and alienated Rachel Alucard in the process due to her actions in preventing Kagutsuchi's destruction after Noel saved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Ragna the Bloodedge</a> from his fate. Its new plan involved using Terumi to smelt Noel into her original identity (Mu-12), use her to track down Amaterasu, and destroy it. While this plan goes off without a hitch, they were ready to reset should Ragna kill Mu... only he chose to restore her as Noel instead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">Terumi planned for this, however, using Phantom's magic to peruse every possibility of the continuum shift</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy">and had Relius kill him before Ragna and Mu's fateful battle so he can infiltrate Takamagahara during this brief period and use a virus program to lobotomize them</a> (for what it's worth, Ragna was supposed to kill Terumi, but the lifelink Terumi established with Mu would complicate affairs for him, and he left the bastard to bleed instead - that's where Relius came in).</span> So as much as the protagonists' brain trust of Rachel, Jubei and Kokonoe wanted to break the plan whenever possible, Terumi got what he wanted in the end. However, he had to pay a price of his own this time - Ragna had to be issued Lambda's Idea Engine, which locks out Terumi's direct control over the Azure Grimoire Ragna wields, Noel survived and is now fully aware that Terumi was playing her (and as much as Terumi acts like he doesn't need her anymore, he really does, and plans on manipulating her in the future), and Jin Kisaragi awakened to the power of order that Terumi fears so much due to the combined efforts of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Makoto, </span>Jubei, Rachel, Hakumen and Ragna, and defected from Terumi's control as well. While Terumi got a new figurehead hero in Tsubaki Yayoi, that same power of order could sever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">brainwashing</a> that compels her to serve the now-corrupt Librarium. On top of that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the aforementioned Makoto possesses knowledge that would cement Tsubaki's correction in alignment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">towards good</a> once said brainwashing elapses, and has sight of other plot threads vital to Terumi's post-Kagutsuchi operations, as well as one tied to her wrist that is linked to Relius' own designs.</span> And that's not the entire bill. Suffice it to say, without a script to work off of, Terumi's going to have his hands full dealing with so many rogue elements at once. Depending on how well the protagonists cohere in Ikaruga, Terumi's plans stand on a razor's edge, with one unplanned rogue element too many away from tipping towards failure - and this time, the damage won't be so small. <br/>And the result in <em>Chronophantasma</em> is: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">going out of control indeed. So much that Terumi ends up dead and Relius overly depressed. Still, the heroes cannot thwart their boss, Hades Izanami, to forcefully brainwash Ragna and prepare to use the Takemikazuchi Embryo to consume all souls in the world. Wait until next game to see how they thwart her plans.</span>

After a certain point in the game, you totally can thwart the villain's plan by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">breaking a crystal</span>. However, this gets you a less-satisfying ending than letting the villain take their plot all the way to the end and thwarting them at the last moment, since you've only forced them to wait 5,000 years <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">while that crystal regenerates</span>, instead of stopping them outright. And both endings actually reveal that they've already spent <em>millions</em> of years on their plan, so a 5,000 year wait really is only a minor setback for them.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneralProtectionFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneralProtectionFault">General Protection Fault</a></em>, Trudy's plan to split up the cast proceeds smoothly until Nick is in the Statue of Liberty, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">unwittingly</a> using his Velociraptor device to power the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> that she is using to hold the United Nations hostage in her bid to take over the world, leading to a final desperate attempt to stop her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>: A version of this occurs by necessity in all games of Sburb. In every session, someone must defeat the White King (good guy) and begin the Reckoning, a 24 hour period during which meteors from the Veil (asteroid belt) bombard Skaia (sparkly planet-thing in the Medium vital to winning the game). The catch is that Skaia has defence portals which can send the meteors to the host planet (i.e. Earth in the comic), and these portals can send things to the past. It just so happens that the players of Sburb invariably create themselves, and the baby versions of themselves get sent back through these portals to become themselves. So if the Reckoning did not happen, the players of the game would not exist! So if Stage One were thwarted, that would cause a time paradox. Which doesn't happen in this universe (usually).

<ul><li> Common and constant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em>. Every season involves the heroes rushing around the world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll">to find objects of power</a> before the forces of evil can collect them all and become all powerful. Nearly every season ends with said forces of evil collecting everything anyway and having to be defeated at their most powerful. This was only averted twice: the first time, Jackie and co. did manage to stop Shendu from freeing all of his demon brethren, but then Shendu manages to find an easier way to do it and it happens anyway. The second time is to stop Daolon Wong from collecting Shendu's scattered powers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">echoing the plot of the first season</a>) — in an amusing twist, the season ends with Daolon having only some of them, trying to make a deal with Shendu to get it all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon">and then Shendu tricking him and getting all the power himself</a>.

<ul><li> The gang originally had the sensible idea of waiting until <em>after</em> Sozin's +300 Comet of Firebending was gone before deciding to take on the Fire Lord. Then they find out at the last minute that, in a shocking plot twist, the villains do <em>not</em> plan to spend their period of temporary nigh-omnipotence sitting in their respective throne rooms eating take-out. Slightly more surprising, they don't intend to use the power to merely overpower the remaining resistance forces in the Earth Kingdom; instead they plan to <em>incinerate the entire continent</em>. So the heroes no longer have the luxury of waiting. Then various operational delays keep them from being able to attack the Fire Lord in the 48 hours available <em>before</em> the arrival of the comet. Nope, the final battle just <em>has</em> to be on comet day, and no other day.
</li><li> Also, the fall of Ba Sing Se and the failure of the invasion on the Day of Black Sun are both instances of this trope in action. Had the heroes been successful in either, the epic battle of the season finale wouldn't have been quite as epic (if it had even happened), as the Fire Nation's resources would have been depleted. What's even worse is that they absolutely could have prevented Azula's takeover of Ba Sing Se; in fact, it looked like they were just about to do it... Until Zuko put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>, betrayed them to his family, and shook up the battle enough for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Dai Li</a> to show up, and for Azula to back-shoot Aang with lightning in the middle of his transformation into the Avatar State. And in turn, a victory by the Gaang in Ba Sing Se would've allowed the Day of Black Sun invasion to have been carried out with the entire army of the Earth Kingdom instead of just a few dozen people. Or heck, even the smaller invasion would have caught the Fire Nation by surprise if only the Earth King hadn't blurted out the invasion plan to Team Azula, disguised as Kyoshi Warriors.

The following episode, "Gideon Rises", has them reveal Gideon's nature to the town and get him sent to jail.

In one episode, Dark Helmet tells Skroob that it's time to move to Phase 2 of their plan. Skroob suggests staying at Phase 1, because things always go so well during Phase 1, and Lone Starr never shows up to ruin things until they move to Phase 2.

Particularly noticeable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">A Sitch In Time</a></em>, where she can't stop the villains from assembling the time monkey, or going back in time, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shego</span> escaping to use it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, but fixes it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButtonEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButtonEnding">undoing that whole timeline</a>.

</li><li> This seems to happen quite a bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>.
<ul><li> Twilight Sparkle is unable to prevent the release of Nightmare Moon and she causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds">The Night That Never Ends</a>. Fortunately, she discovers of the Elements of Harmony and realized her plus five other ponies that she made friends with are able to utilize said elements, and thus use them to defeat Nightmare Moon. This may or may not be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> by Celestia.
</li><li> Discord succeeds in breaking the six, turning their elements around and turning them into jerks and Twilight into a friendless sack of depression. Fortunately, Spike had been receiving the letters that Twilight Sparkle sent to Celestia concerning the studies of friendship, and reading them helped cause her to realize the importance of friendship and sets off to help her friends remember as well, thus allowing them to use the Elements to defeat Discord. This is more likely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> by Celestia, however.
</li><li> Canterlot has been completely taken over and not only did Celestia get beaten by Queen Chrysalis, but the Mane Six also got beaten up by her mooks. Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActStupidity">Third Act Stupidity</a> sets in for Chrysalis and leaves the six unguarded. This causes Twilight to free her brother and her sister-in-law-to-be and allow them to create a powerful shield to knock the Queen and her mooks out of Canterlot. No really smart gambits here. Heck, if Chrysalis wasn't holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a>, she would have <em>won</em>.
</li><li> King Sombra manages to make it through Cadance's shield and is dead set on reclaiming his throne, with Twilight being unable to bring the Crystal Heart to the others in time. Fortunately, her assistant Spike takes the heart for her and brings it over to Cadence, who with the help of the Crystal Ponies, manage to <em>kill</em> Sombra with a powerful concentrated blast. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">It's a good thing Spike was there</a>.
</li><li> Tirek takes over <em>all</em> of Equestria with Discord in tow, uses Twilight's friends as leverage to get her to give up her powers, and literally has no opposition to defeat him. Celestia actually <em>tried</em> to thwart Stage One in the form of Discord, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">that failed</a>. After that, Celestia opted to get Twilight supercharged, but she ran out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>-planning power she had back in Season 2 and told her not to tell her friends, thus prompting the 'friends as leverage' part to go through. In short, not only did they not thwart Stage One, they didn't thwart stages two through four either. The <em>only</em> reason Tirek is defeated in the end is because that 'friends as leverage' wound up unlocking a treasure chest that was mentioned every episode or so. Whether this was a gambit planned by either Celestia or Discord or if it was sheer luck bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">another story for another day</a>.

Amusingly, failing Stage One drove him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverRecycleYourSchemes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverRecycleYourSchemes">scrap the entire plan</a> rather than come up with another way to raise the money, even though he eventually did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse">Danger Mouse</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series subverts this in "Demons Aren't Dull." He apparently surrenders to the Demon of the Fourth Dimension and asks for a last request: to show Penfold how powerful the Demon is. As DM explains it, the Demon offers to demonstrate: the Demon connects a door from his dimension to a door in our dimension. Then DM explains that if the Demon's door is closed (which DM asks him to do and he obliges) and the door in ours is closed, the Demon would be powerless as he would be trapped between dimensions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu">DM applies this instantly before he tells it.</a>
</li><li> In the sequence before, with him and Penfold in the Demon's dimension, he threatens to report the Demon to the 4-D Union (the union of Deadly and Diabolical Dimensional Demons) for violation of a clause in their contract—to return victims to their own dimension before the end of episode 4 or their powers are revoked by the Boss Demon. Scared, the Demon obliges and returns our heroes to their own realm. A double-double cross ensues: DM says he was bluffing about the contract clause, and the Demon deposited the duo in their own realm—in midair, causing them to tumble towards the Earth.
