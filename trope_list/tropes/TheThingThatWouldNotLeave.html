In a few stories, Dennis even decides that he needs to do something to "cheer up Mr. Wilson" as a result of yet another attempt by Wilson to ask him to leave, leading to more mayhem.

<ul><li> Used when Zonker moves in with Mike and J.J. to the point of seriously grating on their nerves. J.J. comments at one point that it's like having a teenage son (which was surprisingly appropriate, with Mike even giving him an allowance).
</li><li> J.J.'s once and future boyfriend Zeke also moved back in with her when she started dating Mike, after Zeke had burned down Duke's house.
</li><li> And then there are the times when Zonker's father moves in after bickering with his wife, much to <em>Zonker's</em> annoyance.
</li><li> One story arc had Zonker moving in with an English nobleman when he was called in to vote a tiebreaker for the House of Lords (he bought an English title, long story). Long after the vote, he remains at the castle, oblivious to the clear exasperation the castle staff and his host feel towards him. He finally is booted forcibly by his host, who took the liberty of packing for him.
</li><li> As of this writing, it appears another such scenario is in the works with Uncle Duke. One might expect Duke to be the unwanted guest, but in this case he's the host—the guest is Trff Bmzklfrpz, former President-for-Life of Greater Berzerkistan. Duke arranged an extraction to get him out of Berzerkistan just ahead of a revolution, but it turns out that Trff's Swiss bank accounts have been frozen, and he's penniless with nowhere to go.

Draco works for a charity organisation. When the organisation plans a gala to raise money for the children who lost their parents in the war against Voldemort, Draco's boss demands that he makes sure that the Great Harry Potter is in attendance. The problem is that since the war, Harry has turned agoraphobic and refuses to leave Grimmauld Place, which prompts Draco to intentionally invoke this trope. It's not that he never leaves, but he goes there every day, sits around for hours and tries to annoy Harry into agreeing to come to the gala. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He succeeds.</span>

With the appearance of the crocuses and with the first liquid notes of the robin all his poor relatives from Brownsville, East New York, Midwood and West Bronx descended upon him in the country in force. They never gave him a moment's peace or privacy until the leaves began to turn. Then they returned to New York. <br/>One day, as he sat gloomily regarding a young third cousin-in-law upon whom a thousand hints had been wasted, he sighed and said, "There is little likelihood, is there, that you'll ever come on another visit here?" <br/>"What a thing to say!" protested the young man with heat.

Lydia also occasionally did this to Darcy and Lizzy, but her husband was never allowed to accompany her - which, given the history between Wickham and Darcy, is entirely unsurprising.
</li><li> <em>Bartleby, the Scrivener,</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HermanMelville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HermanMelville">Herman Melville</a>, is about a man who is hired by an office as a scrivener, becomes increasingly particular about the work he does (to the point where he "would prefer not" do just about anything, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even eat, in his final days.</span>), and <em>just won't leave,</em> despite having been told to get out many times. Though Bartleby's employer puts up with him for a time because he's not harming anything or anyone by merely staying in the office, he ends up deciding to move his offices elsewhere to get rid of him (as he can't bring himself to forcibly throw Bartleby out). Even then, Bartleby <em>still</em> remains in the office building until he is arrested for trespassing because the new owner of the office doesn't want to put up with him.
</li><li> One of the many subplots of Anthony Trollope's <em>Ayala's Angel</em> involves the usually generous patriarch Sir Thomas Tringle being driven to exasperation by the failure of his new son-in-law, the Honourable Septimus Traffik, to remove himself and his new wife to an establishment of their own and quit mooching off her rich family, despite his continual hints, barbs, and even demands. Near the end of the book the Traffiks do finally move out, though.

Unfortunately, these animals - which increase in number - take advantage of his hospitality, and refuse to leave. When Thidwick's herd gives him an ultimatum - get rid of them or leave the herd - he still can't bring himself to be rude to his guests, and leaves. Still, the guests grow in number and size, inviting more guests, and refusing to consider the increasing physical and psychological load they're putting on their host. Finally, when a group of hunters comes after Thidwick, he decides to stand up for himself, and sheds his antlers, fleeing to safety and leaving his inconsiderate guests behind. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">The last page of the book shows them made into taxidermy specimens, still on the shed antlers.</a>

It's somewhat subverted in that they like her, don't mind her staying and are entirely sympathetic with her problem of not having enough to get her own place, but their place isn't that big and Craig kinda wants their flat and sofa back (especially since Jen's trying to get pregnant). Also a subversion in that Kate feels extremely guilty about moving in, constantly searches for apartments, and moves out the minute fashion editor Dolly Vargas offers her a room.

Ostensibly it's so they can get to know each other better, and Melanie her new nephew Wade, as well helping Scarlett get over her supposed grief over the death of her husband Charles (and possible legitimate post-partum depression). In reality, it's so she can be close to Ashley when he comes to visit Melanie. In any event, though the plan is only for Scarlett to visit, the general assumption of everyone is that she's there to stay, as this is a tradition in the South—people visit relatives for Christmas, but don't leave until June, newlyweds visit relatives during their honeymoon but don't leave until after the birth of their second child, elderly aunts/uncles come for Sunday dinner but don't leave until they <em>die</em>.

Gus tries warning him that he'd get into deeper trouble (like when the father sets out mousetraps when he believes that there's a mouse in the house), but the mouse refuses to listen.

</li><li> One of the earliest examples is from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em> with guest-star Tennessee Ernie Ford as Lucy's "Cousin Ernie" who stays over for one episode and wears out his welcome by the next one. Hilariously Lampshaded by Lucy on Ernie's second appearance when she says, "He stayed overnight with us for a couple of weeks once."
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em> had two police officers use Carly and Spencer's apartment for a stakeout. They eat food out of their refrigerator, interrupt the webshow, one of them brings his bratty little kid over (who screams very loudly when he finds out they're out of soda) and one of the cops is a bully from Spencer's childhood.
<ul><li> They've also dealt with literally dozens of people (somewhere around 40 to 50) staying at their apartment room in "iBeat The Heat" when word gets out Spencer has a back-up battery-operated air conditioner during a heatwave in Seattle when all the power goes out (which of course was the result of people overusing their own ACs). This episode probably served as a satire of illegal immigration or overflowing of people into more urbanized areas.
</li><li> Don't forget Mandy. She's a cuckoo pest who's annoying as hell rudely disrupting their webcast shows, making duck "quack" sounds wearing a duck mask and keeps following the iCarly team wherever they go.
</li><li> Spencer in "iSpace Out" runs into one girl who for some reason stays in his apartment room and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless">doesn't talk at all</a>.

</li><li> Partial subversion in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em>: Tully is invited to stay over one housemate's objections, but by the end of the episode the positions regarding him have reversed, with the original naysayer defending Tully's continued presence against the others' complaints.
<ul><li> The second-to-last season gives a truly disturbing example. An incredibly unpleasant huckster is bitten by a werewolf and ends up homeless and penniless. The housemates let him stay with them out of sympathy, but he proceeds to secretly trick Tom into handing over all his money for "investments" (money being used to give Tom's adopted father a proper funeral, no less) and then convince him that Annie and Hal secretly don't care about Tom and are deliberately ignoring his birthday (in reality, neither even knew it <em>was</em> Tom's birthday). The reason he was doing this? He wanted to drive Tom to leave permanently, so <em>he</em> would have a place to stay in the house. Even after Hal confronts him about this, after Tom was found miserably living in a tent in the woods, the con man still is convinced he'll be able to stay on with them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One doesn't feel too sorry for him when Hal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">kills him</a>.</span>

The problem solves itself when a bullet rips through a nearby wall and kills the moocher.

It's a variant in that they <em>both</em> end up utterly miserable, but they're both too polite to admit that the other is driving them nuts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SecretDiaryOfACallGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SecretDiaryOfACallGirl">Secret Diary of a Call Girl</a></em> the main character (a call girl) has a one night stand with a man who is not a client. Unaware of her profession and unemployed, the guy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a>) insists on hanging out with Hannah at her apartment. Not wanting to be rude, she doesn't ask him to leave. He eventually leaves when her friend Ben shows up and claims he is her fiancee.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, the "Pond Life" webisode has the Doctor rescue an Ood from a sticky situation, only to escape the TARDIS and end up in Amy and Rory's house. For the next month or so, they are forced to live with the Ood (who insists on serving as their butler), until the Doctor can come and pick him up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched">Bewitched</a></em>, Mr. Kravitz stayed with Darren and Samantha for several days after he and Mrs. Kravitz had a huge fight, much to their annoyance. Samantha eventually fixed the issue by making them to dream about the day Mr. Kravitz proposed, causing them to run into each others' arms once they woke up.
</li><li> Played with and justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em>. Once he started dating Darlene, David started spending a lot more time at the Conners, to the point he was at their house more than he was at their own. Roseanne didn't mind so much since David was a lot nicer and better behaved than her own kids, though did advise David to back off some when she saw Darlene wasn't comfortable with him being so close. Later on though, it came out that David's mother was abusive, so he had perfectly good reason to want to be at his house as little as possible. Upon finding that out, Roseanne had David move in with them permanently.
</li><li> Zig-zagged with Wilson in season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>. After Wilson leaves his wife, he moves in with House, and House resorts to a campaign of pranks to get Wilson to leave — but when Wilson actually starts apartment-hunting, House ends up intentionally sabotaging him.
<ul><li> Played straight twice over in the penultimate episode of Season 6. After initially seeming okay with having House as a roommate indefinitely, Wilson asks him to move out when he starts getting serious with his girlfriend. House reluctantly goes back to his own apartment, only to find that Alvie, his roommate from the mental hospital at the start of the season, has moved in in his absence and isn't eager to leave.
</li></ul></li><li> In a sketch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ManStrokeWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ManStrokeWoman">Man Stroke Woman</a></em> a woman tries to break up with her unbearably lazy boyfriend, who for some reason won't understand that she actually wants to break up. She tries to be nice at first, using phrases like " It's not you its me." She finally snaps when he disagrees, saying that she has been wonderful. She lets him know how lazy and unattractive he has been. He keeps taking it as joking and continues to play his video games. Eventually she is seen sitting with him, eating chips and watching tv, consistently repeating a defeated " Get out. Get out. Get out."
</li><li> In Season Eight of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>, Stuart moves into Mrs. Wolowitz's house as her caretaker and companion. After she passes away, and Howard and Bernadette move in, they decide he can stay until he gets his own place. They soon come to regret this, as he shows no signs of even <em>thinking about</em> leaving.
<ul><li> Sheldon sees Penny as this, because he's very annoyed over Penny eating their food without ever paying them back, piggy-backing on their Wifi, sitting in his preferred couch spot, and in one episode she keeps bugging him for advice on how to ace through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfConan">Age of Conan</a>.

NBC's Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel happened to be in town, which he almost <em>never</em> is, so when he swung by her daily rundown meeting to say hello to everyone, everyone enthusiastically said 'hello' back. But then, in Rachel's words, "he <em>didn't leave</em>." He just hung around the meeting until Rachel, overcome by curiosity, asked, "Richard, is there something you'd like to add to the meeting?" At which point Richard let out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigYes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigYes">Big "YES!"</a> and started excitedly explaining The Very Huge Deal That Just Happened in Iraq. (And when Rachel noticed his hand twitching and handed him a whiteboard marker, he <em>diagrammed</em> it.) When he finished explaining the Huge Deal, a very impressed Rachel essentially said, "Yeah, you're coming on my show tonight." And thus Richard Engel got to tell all of her viewers about the Huge Deal by parking himself in her rundown meeting and counting on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">long-standing friendship</a> and Rachel's innate curiosity to do the rest.

<ul><li> Elaine and Kramer have opposite views of this. In "The Busboy," Elaine considers a week too long to have a house guest, and in "The Wig Master," Kramer cheerfully says that his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">Bob Sacomano</a> once stayed with him for a year and a half.

His perkiness becomes too much for them to bear that they ditch him in a "Costgo" but soon regret that decision and go get him back...just for him to remind them how annoying he was that they both jump out of the running car and watch him horrified as he disappears in the distance...and <em>then</em> they go back to missing him.

<ul><li> Daffy is also an example of this in the same show. He moved in until he got back on his feet and stayed for seven years, apparently without realizing at all that he is not really someone you would want to be around for that long. The situation is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in an episode where Bugs accidentally cracks a water pipe in the house.

<ul><li> Not to mention every Charlie Dog cartoon, ever, is about Charlie weaseling his way into a stranger's household (frequently that of Porky Pig) and proceeding to drive his new "master" crazy.
</li><li> In "The Fair Haired Hare", Bugs and Sam are court-ordered to share Sam's prairie home after Sam builds over Bugs' hole in the ground. Sam does more than try to get Bugs to leave...he tries to kill him.
</li><li> "From Hare to Heir" has Bugs representing a firm awarding Duke Sam 1 million pounds under the provision he keeps his temper in check with Bugs deducting any amount he sees warrants whenever Sam blows up. Bugs spends the rest of the cartoon making Sam's life a living hell, just to see if and when he loses his temper.
</li><li> In "The Stupor Salesman", Daffy is a door-to-door salesman who takes a taxi to the hideout of a notorious bank robber and pesters him to buy something. Despite the bank robber making very (violently) clear that he is not interested in anything Daffy has to sell, Daffy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">refuses to take no for an answer</a>, and makes it a point to not leave until he's made a sale.

Bean finally gets rid of him by ditching him at the restaurant after indulgently encouraging Harry to eat all he wants with empty promises of footing the bill himself (after Harry finished eating, Bean snuck into the bathroom and hid in the ducts), leaving Harry to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkOffTheDebt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkOffTheDebt">work off the hefty bill</a>.

<ul><li> The episode in question has Supes having to put up with Mxyzptlk. In this case it's not so much "never leaving", rather can't keep from coming back every three months after making him say his name backwards.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> special <em>He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown</em> has Snoopy sent across town for obedience training.

Then he starts squatting at the school in full Madea garb and routine, and nobody can get him to leave because Token is the only person who thinks he's funny and won't stop giving him money.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBelushi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBelushi">John Belushi</a> was like this by many accounts, casually dropping by at the houses of friends, and sometimes strangers, making himself at home, eating their food before falling asleep, and generally staying way beyond the point of welcome. In fact, he directly inspired the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">SNL</a></em> sketch that now names the trope.
</li><li> In real life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a> paid a visit to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a>. Andersen was supposed to stay for a night, but he ended up mooching off of Dickens for over a month. Reportedly, Dickens made ever-increasingly obvious hints to the ever-oblivious Andersen to leave, and refused to answer Andersen's correspondence when he'd gone - much to Andersen's confusion. So enraged was Dickens that he wrote in the mirror in Andersen's room "Hans Christian Andersen slept in this bed for five weeks." The character of Uriah Heep in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DavidCopperfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DavidCopperfield">David Copperfield</a></em> is said to have been partially based on him.

</li><li> Used by Queen Elizabeth I as a tactic to financially bankrupt nobles with questionable loyalties at best. Since she was the Queen they had to put her up like a Queen. It was often a cover for her spies to dig through the nobles' dirty laundry while she and her <em>very extensive</em> entourage (sometimes literally) ate them out of house and home - as well as a way to save on costs to the royal household, which was not in the best financial condition in Elizabethan times.
</li><li> The proverb "Visitors and fish smell in three days." Some variations of this appear all throughout history, from ancient China to Poor Richard's almanac.
</li><li> In 1971, Chilean socialist President Salvador Allende extended an invitation to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FidelCastro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FidelCastro">Fidel Castro</a> to visit the country. He made a visit <em>supposedly</em> for just a week, but he ended up staying for a <em>month</em>. And to top it all, when he returned to Cuba, he declared that they had nothing to learn from Chile.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Immolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Immolation">Immolation</a> drummer Craig Smilowski got booted from the band due to his habit of crashing on lead guitarist Bob Vigna's couch for weeks on end without paying rent. According to Ross Dolan, it wasn't an overnight decision; Vigna had been dropping increasingly less subtle hints that he was getting sick of Smilowski sitting around his house all day and that he needed to get a job (the fact that he apparently wasn't showing up to rehearsal didn't help), but it did not register, and so Smilowski was eventually asked to leave the band as a result. Dolan also made it clear that they didn't harbor any ill will towards Smilowski as a person, just that he was a shitty bandmate.
</li><li> Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks
<ul><li> He once stayed at a friend's house for weeks, commandeering their couch, eating their food, and ruining their laptops, among other things. The whole story was told to former <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">The Colbert Report</a></em> head writer Allison Silverman, who made a dramatized video about it.
</li><li> He later did it again at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he'd been granted asylum in August 2012 to avoid extradition for various criminal charges. Even after having promised to leave the embassy if the US released Chelsea Manning (one of the sources of the leaked documents), he went back on it and stayed after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> did so when leaving office. In October 2018, Assange's behavior was reported to have gotten <em>worse</em>, to the point where the <a class="urllink" href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/ecuador-reprimands-assange-take-care-of-cat">embassy staff issued orders for him to clean up after himself and his cat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. By December, 2018, the Ecuadorian and British governments negotiated an agreement that said that the Brits wouldn't extradite Assange to a country with the death penalty if he left the embassy, but Assange rejected the deal and continued to refuse to leave.
</li><li> Finally, he was <em>forced</em> out when, in April 2019, Ecuador revoked his asylum and allowed British police to come into the embassy and arrest him. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/04/12/mystery-julian-assanges-cat-where-will-it-go-what-does-it-know/">The cat has reportedly been re-homed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

By most accounts, he was unable to adjust to peacetime life, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">holding a Columbia law degree, being a qualified university language instructor, and having many offers to coach</a>. Instead, he would usually stay with friends and acquaintances like Joe DiMaggio and Jimmie Breslin for weeks at a time, often implying that he was still serving in some clandestine capacity. He lived with his brother, Samuel, for 17 years before Samuel got tired of the arrangement and had Moe legally evicted. Moe would go on to live with his sister for the rest of his life.

</li><li> During the comic book crossover <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathMate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathMate">Deathmate</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a> was running over a year late with his issue, so Bob Layton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValiantComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValiantComics">Valiant Comics</a> invoked this trope by hanging around his house and not leaving until Rob finished his half.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrieFisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrieFisher">Carrie Fisher</a> had her own way of dealing with these people. Stay too long after the party's over? No problem, she <em>would</em> run you off... by putting on her copy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a></em>, which she requested in exchange for doing commentaries on the reissues of the classic trilogy. The party's over once this thing comes out, and all the guests are probably gone by the time it's over. Suffice to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">she probably never had to deal with this problem since she implemented this system.</a>
</li><li> Scott Pruitt, EPA Administrator from 2017 to 2018, developed a reputation for this while in office.
<ul><li> He moved into the spare bedroom of two friends (and lobbyists) when he went to Washington, having agreed to pay them 50 dollars a night (well below market rates). What was originally supposed to be a six-week arrangement stretched into months as he took advantage of his friends' hospitality. Pruitt's landlords dropped hint after hint that they wanted him to move out and began sending him listings for houses and apartments in the area before finally telling him, in frustration, that they were going to change the locks to their house and that they were going to rent his room out to someone else. And even though Pruitt was offered a very low price for the room, he apparently never paid his rent on time and would only provide the money after constant cajoling. There was also an incident where Pruitt's Secret Service detail broke down his room's door thinking he'd collapsed, leaving the angry landlords with an expensive repair bill.
</li><li> He also had to be told very bluntly to stop hanging out at the White House Mess, because he was taking up seats and eating food meant for White House staffers.

Tim Templeton never wanted a baby brother and as far as he's concerned, the Boss Baby is The Thing That Would Not Leave. He'd do anything to get rid of him and is thrilled to hear that he might be fired from his job.
