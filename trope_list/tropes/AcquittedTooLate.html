<ul><li> Required by law in every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Giallo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Giallo">Giallo</a> (violent Italian whodunit, featuring amateur sleuths, buckets of gore, and high body counts) ever made. Warning: Italian splatter-opera spoilers galore!
<ul><li> Master of the genre, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarioArgento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarioArgento">Dario Argento</a>, did it with his first-ever Giallo, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirdWithTheCrystalPlumage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirdWithTheCrystalPlumage">The Bird with the Crystal Plumage</a></em>. The prime suspect takes a fatal plunge from a window but it turns out that he was actually protecting the real killer: his crazy knife-wielding wife.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarioArgento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarioArgento">Dario Argento</a> again, but this time bizarrely inverted. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tenebre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tenebre">Tenebre</a></em>, the trope appears to be played straight about halfway through, when a mysterious figure kills the main suspect with an axe to the head. The bizarre inversion stems from the fact that the victim <em>was</em> the original serial killer, but his killer is a copycat who wants to throw suspicion off both of them while he commits some murders of his own. Yeah, Dario has some whacky ideas sometimes.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HangmenAlsoDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HangmenAlsoDie">Hangmen Also Die!</a></em>, the investigation by the Nazis determines that Czaka did not assassinate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/ReinhardHeydrich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/ReinhardHeydrich">Heydrich</a>. By this time, they have already killed him, however. To add insult to injury, they decide to close the case with Czaka as the official culprit in order to save face (having failed to uncover the real assassin despite the harsh reprisals).
</li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLifeOfDavidGale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLifeOfDavidGale">The Life of David Gale</a></em>. The victim had actually committed suicide. David Gale, an anti-death penalty activist with a history of depression, framed himself for her murder and deliberately withheld the evidence proving his innocence until it was too late to save him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">as an attempt to politically sabotage the death penalty by guaranteeing that an innocent man (himself) would be executed</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedGun">The Naked Gun</a></em> movie:
<div class="indent"><strong>Frank Drebin:</strong> Hey! The missing evidence in the Kellner case! My God! He really <em>was</em> innocent! <br/><strong>Captain Ed Hocken:</strong> He went to the chair two years ago, Frank.
</div></li><li> The central point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOxBowIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOxBowIncident">The Ox-Bow Incident</a></em>. Posse lynches suspected cow rustlers; they learn of their error when they get back to town.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PansLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PansLabyrinth">Pan's Labyrinth</a></em> when the villain finds two men with guns he accuses of being rebels and brutally beats to death, despite their protests that they were only hunting rabbits. Inspecting their bags afterwards proves their claim was correct.
</li><li> Supposed to happen in the movie within a movie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePlayer">The Player</a></em>. The writer of <em>Habeas Corpus</em> insists that the main character gets acquitted, but too late. By the end of the movie, however, it's changed to an ending where the acquitted is (ridiculously) saved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShriekIfYouKnowWhatIDidLastFridayTheThirteenth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShriekIfYouKnowWhatIDidLastFridayTheThirteenth">Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th</a></em>: Parodied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IKnowWhatYouDidLastSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IKnowWhatYouDidLastSummer">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a></em> segment when one of the teenagers flashes back to his own sin. His older brother, who's on death row, handed him a letter and asked him to pass it on to the Governor because it would prove his innocence, but his little brother was too much of an asshat to do it on time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePoughkeepsieTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePoughkeepsieTapes">The Poughkeepsie Tapes</a></em>, the killer changes his whole M.O. and starts killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSexWorker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSexWorker">prostitutes</a> in order to frame a cop, who is found guilty and executed. The true killer then makes it clear the day after the execution that the cop was innocent.

<ul><li> Despite being the trope namer, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone">And Then There Were None</a></em> is actually not, strictly speaking, an example itself. There's no wrongful conviction, only suspicions since one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims">Ten Little Murder Victims</a> has to be the killer. The phrase "acquitted too late" refers to the death itself, which clears the victim of said suspicion, but by then it doesn't do them any good. Even this turns out to be false as when the "death proves innocence" idea takes hold, the killer fakes his own death to throw suspicion off himself.
</li><li> In Agatha Christie's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MurderOnTheOrientExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MurderOnTheOrientExpress">Murder on the Orient Express</a></em>, it's mentioned that Ratchett is not only responsible for the death of Daisy Armstrong, but also a maid who was suspected of being an accomplice. She was eventually proven innocent, but only after she had committed suicide.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoTellItOnTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoTellItOnTheMountain">Go Tell It on the Mountain</a></em>, Richard is arrested for a robbery he didn't commit, and while he is acquitted at trial, the experience — including the abuse he takes at the hands of white police officers — leads him to commit suicide on his first night home.
</li><li> In <em>Crimson</em> by Gord Rollo, a man on death row has been convicted of murders that were committed by a demonic creature that has plagued him and framed him. His ally knows he's innocent and she manages to get him exonerated. However, the man doesn't want to be saved, because if he dies then the creature is killed with him, so when it's time to get executed, he embraces his destiny and dies happy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sirius Black</span> had been sent to Azkaban for crimes he didn't commit (and in one case, never actually happened) and wasn't allowed to have a trial. He didn't live long enough to see the real culprit being exposed.
</li><li> Within <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em>, readers learn that Voldemort had his uncle Morfin Gaunt framed and incarcerated for his murder of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">his Muggle father and grandparents</a>. When Dumbledore found evidence indicating the truth, he tried to get the conviction overturned, but Morfin died in prison before the ministry reached their decision.
</li><li> Voldemort also framed a House Elf named Hokey for poisoning her mistress with the same methods he used to frame his uncle. The Ministry didn't bother investigating the situation any further <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">because she was a House Elf.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLincolnLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLincolnLawyer">The Lincoln Lawyer</a></em>, Jesus Menendez had been framed for rape and murder. While he even lived to see himself pardoned once the real culprit had been caught, he caught AIDS while in prison.

A man about to be executed, Adam Grant, believes that everything around him is a dream, and if he is executed, they will all cease to exist. A reporter convinces the prosecutor who convicted Grant that this belief means that Grant is insane and shouldn't be executed. The prosecutor calls the governor and gets a stay of execution, but the call to the prison arrives just after Grant has been executed. After Grant's death, the entire set fades to black. It fades in with a different cast of characters, except for the protagonist. Turns out Grant was right!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em>:
<ul><li> An episode appropriately titled "Death Penalty: Final Appeal" had a man wrongly convicted of rape and murder executed before the detectives could clear his name. In this case, however, the detectives <em>did</em> find evidence to clear the man in time, but the DA who put him in jail stonewalled their attempts to do so. They find the evidence they need and arrest the guilty man, the <em>day after</em> the innocent one was executed.
</li><li> Somewhat in "Thrill Kill": Two innocent men were imprisoned for killing three boys. One of the two hanged himself in prison, which is what prompts the detectives to re-investigate. They manage to free the other one though (it was loosely based on the West Memphis Three, who have now been freed but were still imprisoned at the time).
</li><li> One episode had the plot of a man being convicted of an 'arson' that was a negligent landlord, bad wiring, and an accidental fire. Both the man's kids were killed. His brother defended him and helped reveal his innocence, but there was no explicit mention of the landlord being punished. The innocent man had been killed in prison (this bears a strong resemblance to the case of Cameron Todd Willingham, convicted of murdering his daughters through arson but which may have been just an accident-he was put to death in 2004).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIVerse">CSI Verse</a></em>:
<ul><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em> episode had the suspect arrested in the pre-credits sequence. Throughout the episode, it keeps cutting back to the hell he's going through in prison, until a guard eventually finds him standing over a dead body during a riot with a shank. Turns out that a) he was innocent of the first crime, and b) he killed the other inmate in self-defense; the deceased had been <em>raping</em> him. His dialogue with Horatio at the end implies he's already been screwed up by even his short stay.
</li><li> Also occurred on the main <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> when a registered "sex offender" (he was not a child molester or a pedophile; rather, he got drunk and urinated in public, and while doing so inadvertently exposed himself to some kids) is suspected in the death of a little girl. The mere suspicion (plus revelation of the sex offender status he tried to hide) ruins what little life he'd built for himself in Vegas.
</li><li> Another episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> began with an ex-cop convicted for murdering his wife (another cop who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">really got around</a>) getting stabbed to death during a prison riot. The investigation of his death revealed that his "victim" had faked her death to get him sent to prison and had arranged his death when he tried to get his case reopened.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>:
<ul><li> The second-season episode "Taken" starts off with a young woman stumbling out of an elevator during a hotel opening. The staff shuttles her off to the side, and a suspect (who is on the sex offender registry as a pedophile) is later arrested. Turns out it's a scam to get money from the hotel, the supposedly under-age "victim" was in her 20s rather than her teens, the sex was consensual, and the "suspect" was a patsy set up by the girl and her family. Unfortunately, by the time anyone remembers that they have an innocent man in jail, the "suspect" had already been killed in prison (pedophiles being <em>very</em> unpopular in prison populations). Fortunately, that made the woman and her accomplices legally culpable for murder. Disturbingly enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Munch is the only one who is bothered by the suspect's death</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">as opposed to being glad the woman and her accomplices didn't get away</a>) and takes the trouble of informing the dead man's ex-girlfriend (who, it turns out, was the same girl the suspect purportedly "molested" when they both were teenagers, he 17 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBait">she 15</a> and who, it also turns out, was still in love with him and had been for nearly a decade).
</li><li> In another episode, a young woman "recalls" that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">her father sexually abused her</a> in her youth after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">a psychiatrist "recovers" memories of the abuse.</a> In typical SVU fashion it goes downhill from there, with the father being vilified as a monster by everyone, including the SVU department and his own family, culminating in the father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">being shot by his other daughter</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother">in a misguided attempt to protect her sister from him.</a> Only <strong>then</strong> does the truth come to light. The ultimate vindication was that the daughter's hymen was intact.
</li><li> An unusual variation comes in "Unstable", in which the critical death is not the innocent man, but the man who actually committed the crime. The innocent man remains alive, but with the real rapist dead, there's no way to prove his innocence, and he will have to serve out his sentence.
</li><li> The same situation is narrowly averted half a season later, in "Confidential"; much like the earlier case, the real murderer is found after committing a similar crime, but is killed before he can be tried. Fortunately for the wrongfully convicted man, the dead man's lawyer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">breaks privilege</a>, admits he confessed to her, and points the detectives to the evidence they need to prove that her client, not the man in prison, committed the murder.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>:
<ul><li> A series of murders are carried out in one day. The detectives discover circumstantial evidence connecting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">loner</a> to the crime, and he refuses point blank to give an account of his whereabouts during the crimes. While he's remanded into custody, the ADA tracks down his mother, who reveals that her son was with his gay lover at the time, and the reason he wouldn't talk is he didn't want her to know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">not knowing she already did</a>. By the time this is discovered, however, he has been stabbed to death in prison.
</li><li> Another episode uncovered the fact that a lab technician falsified fingerprint evidence that sent two men to prison. One of them had been murdered in prison by the time the episode takes place. The survivor is later exonerated (the lab tech could be charged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder">felony murder</a> for the former).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">UK version</a> of the show had an episode, "Shaken", where a young nanny and her boyfriend were accused of killing her employer's baby. They were arrested and jailed, but the nanny is freed, leaving the boyfriend behind bars. By the end of the episode, the husband's ex-girlfriend (who couldn't have children) confesses that she killed the baby out of rage and depression. The boyfriend is cleared, but the Crown Prosecutors find out that he was beaten to death by another prisoner when they go to get him out of jail.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InJustice">In Justice</a></em>, a gentle mentally challenged man was arrested for the murder of a priest and sentenced to death. His lawyers try every last-minute appeal they can think of to delay his execution and they fail. He dies on schedule. Afterward, we see the heroes know who the real murderer is, and are able to persuade his wife to retract the alibi she gave him. If the team continues investigating (a strong possibility give that the hero confronts the murderer in his house) they may be able to find enough proof to get a posthumous exoneration.
</li><li> Played with in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser">The Closer</a></em>; Priority Homicide is fairly certain they know who the serial killer is, they just need to find him... which they do, as a corpse, murdered before the murders (re)started. The guy never had a chance to claim his innocence.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrimeSuspect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrimeSuspect">Prime Suspect</a> Five</em>, when Campbell Lafferty turns himself in for the murder of a drug dealer, but the police are unable to corroborate his story and release him. He is subsequently murdered by the drug dealer's associates.
</li><li> Happens a lot in Chinese/Hong Kong TV dramas. If set in the past, executions are done quite a ways away from the courts. So if anyone innocent happens to get the penalty that day, they better hope for a fast messenger on a horse before their head gets chopped off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MonkS1E7MrMonkAndTheOtherWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MonkS1E7MrMonkAndTheOtherWoman">Mr. Monk and the Other Woman</a>." Grayson is the primary suspect in the early investigations, thanks to his file being burned. Stottlemeyer drops him off the suspect list when he's found dead in Monica's garage.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em> has a scene like this, that drives the executioner into a depression:
<div class="indent"><strong>Condemned Psycho:</strong> Hey old man, how does it feel killing an innocent? <br/><strong>Executioner:</strong> Don't make me laugh, murderer. <br/><strong>Condemned Psycho:</strong> Ooh, not me. The previous guy who claimed innocence all along, looking at you with puppy dog eyes. <em>I</em> did it.
</div></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em> involves the team searching for the actual killer and saving a man convicted on death row. To the team's heartbreak, he's executed before they can find the real killer, and Abbott remarks that with the suspect dead, their bosses will never allow them to pursue any other leads. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, it turns out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">elaborate trick</a>. They were pretty sure that either the victim's husband or his new wife were guilty, so they faked the execution to gauge the reactions of the suspects, and Abbott deliberately dropped the comment about the case dying with the execution so that the real killer would think they couldn't be touched. Once Jane realized it was the wife, he planted the idea in the husband's head and then slipped a listening device in his pocket before sending the couple home. As predicted, the husband confronted the wife and she admitted what she'd done... at which point the FBI pulled up, arrested her, and then promptly called the governor to tell him what they'd heard. With the wife's admission on the record, the execution is halted and the innocent man released</span>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue">NYPD Blue</a></em>, the squad investigates a child rape/murder in which they strongly suspect the boy's father, but don't have a strong case against him. They arrest a mute homeless street preacher in order to make the real suspect overconfident so that he'll slip up. Tragically, the decoy arrestee is too <em>non compos mentis</em> to realize that they know he's innocent, and commits suicide in his cell.
</li><li> Averted in an episode of the 1950s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">The Adventures of Superman</a></em>. Supes flies the pardon from the governor to the prison where he arrives just as the switch is being thrown. He interposes his arm in the way to block the charge from going through the innocent man.
</li><li> An episode of <em>Strange Luck</em> handles this trope in a surprising way. A murderer confesses to his crime on the same day that an innocent man is going to be executed for this same murder. The governor believes him and issues a pardon. A series of strange events (its in the title of the show, folks) keeps the governor from being able to just call the prison, and with time running out, the governor, the murderer, and the show's hero Chance Harper all rush to the prison to stop the death of an innocent man. A thunderstorm with heavy rain comes up, making the roads slick, and Harper crashes into a power pole on the way to the prison. This has two effects: power to the prison is cut just in time to stop the electrocution of the innocent man... and the real murderer gets killed by a falling power line.
</li><li> <em>Very</em> narrowly subverted on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em>. A man attacked by two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo">Wendigo</a> shot one in self-defense and was sentenced to death because nobody believed his claim that he'd been attacked by monsters. When Nick and Hank find the evidence that the surviving wendigo is a cannibal killer, they call the DA, who doesn't pick up her phone. When they finally get in contact with her, she hesitates before giving the order for the execution to stop while some of the lethal injection had already been administered.
</li><li> Plays a part in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathInParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathInParadise">Death in Paradise</a></em> episode "In the Footsteps of a Killer"; eight years prior, a woman was arrested for murder and died in prison, as she was the only one of the pool of suspects who couldn't provide an alibi. However, the episode opens when a man the victim slept with on the night of the crime returns to the island to give her an alibi; the night he slept with the victim was the last day of his holiday on the island and he had an early morning flight out, with the result that he never realised she was in trouble until he returned. This new information leads to the team re-opening the case and determining that the true culprit had faked their own alibi.
</li><li> In the last <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SevenDays1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SevenDays1998">7 Days (1998)</a></em> episode to air, a man is convicted of murder and executed. Then, another man reveals he committed the murder and publishes the missing security tape — after he fled into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunForTheBorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunForTheBorder">South America</a>. Frank uses an emergency to take a copy of the tape with him into the past (the guy was a friend of his), but the data doesn't survive the travel. This is one of the few episodes to feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>.
</li><li> In the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKilling">The Killing</a></em>, Linden doesn't find out who the real killer is until it's too late for Seward.
</li><li> <em>Very</em> narrowly averted in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash1990">The Flash (1990)</a></em>. A man accused of murdering his wife is sentenced to be given the chair at midnight. He successfully pulls the guy out of the chair at super-speed at 11:59:59 PM. Then he directs the guard's attention to the presence of the man's still-living wife (who Flash had brought with him to the prison to exonerate her husband) and exposes the person who kidnapped her.

An ex-con falsely accused of murder escapes custody and succeeds in proving his innocence, but is killed by the real culprits in the process.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrossingJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrossingJordan">Crossing Jordan</a></em> inverted this.

</li><li> Possibly at the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace">Without a Trace</a></em> episode "Two Families". The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">Victim of the Week</a> was a man who believed that his death-row inmate son was innocent.

Unusually for this trope, it's not Galvanax who executed him - he was destroyed by the Rangers while trying to prove his innocence and get back on Galvanax's good side.

<ul><li> Yomiel is struck and killed by the Temsik meteorite while escaping police custody in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick">Ghost Trick</a></em>. He's cleared of all charges six months later. And after using time travel shenanigans, Yomiel is acquitted of treason but <em>still</em> sent to jail for attempted homicide of a little girl who was cooking yams in front of an open flame in the middle of nowhere with her parents nowhere to be found. The case is <em>really</em> ambiguous and Yomiel himself lampshades that the circumstances which led to him taking a little girl hostage were suspicious and disturbing to begin with. He still technically serves the full sentence for this crime, which cost him and his fiancée ten years of their lives.
</li><li> One of the tasks the protagonist must perform in <em>Veil of Darkness</em> is to clear the name of someone hanged for the murder discovered at the beginning of the game. The magistrate just wanted someone to pay for the murder and chose an innocent man, but this leaves the innocent man's spirit trapped in his body until he can be cleared. When the protagonist successfully proves the hanged man was innocent, he's able to move onto the afterlife and the actual murderer is hanged as well.
</li><li> This can happen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrisonArchitect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrisonArchitect">Prison Architect</a></em>. Prisoners on Death Row have a "clemency" percentage, which is the chance that they will be found innocent of their crime or have their sentence reduced. If you execute a prisoner who is later declared innocent, you'll be heavily fined and possibly fired. However, if their clemency was under 5% (or 10%, after researching Reduce Execution Liability) then you will not be punished.
</li><li> This factors into one of the optional side quests in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> DLC <em>Legacy</em>. Hawke and company learn the ultimate fate of Tethras Garen, one of Varric's distant relatives, who was convicted (a few hundred years before the time of the game) of murdering his own sister and sentenced to die in the Deep Roads. Some months after his conviction, it was discovered that the organized crime outfit the Carta was actually responsible for the murder, and the distraught family spent years trying to find him and bring him home. The Deep Roads being what they are, it's likely that he was dead before his innocence was ever brought to light; but if the quest is completed, his remains are located and given the traditional dwarven funeral rites.

Over the course of the trial, Mia not only comes close to clearing him of the crime he's on trial for but also the crime he got sent to Death Row for in the first place. Unfortunately, the real murderer is Dahlia Hawthorne, who has Fawles wrapped around her finger so tightly that he commits suicide on the stand rather than testify against her. Thankfully, Mia gets Dahlia later and when she pops up <em>yet again</em>, Phoenix has her number.

<ul><li> Joan of Arc was found innocent by the court... 25 years after she was burnt at the stake. The vilifications continued for a long time in England, though, and for good reason (i.e. Joan fought for France, who was England's nemesis during the Hundred Years' War), and the basis for her trial to begin with (Joan's claims of being told by God she should defeat the English naturally was a massive threat which they had wanted to discredit with it).
</li><li> Capital punishment was abolished in Britain after <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Evans">Timothy Evans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was hanged for a murder which, it was concluded sixteen years later, had been committed by the serial killer <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Christie_(murderer)">John Christie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, his landlord, who was a major prosecution witness against him at trial. Commemorated in the folk song "Go Down, Ye Murderers":
<div class="indent"><em>They sent Tim Evans to the drop for a crime he didn't do <br/>'Twas Christie was the murderer, the judge and jury too</em>

In contrast to this, the actual killer (who was underage and thus couldn't be hanged) got off with only ten years.
</li><li> Jamie Macpherson actually was guilty, but he still had a pardon coming when — according to legend — the townspeople, seeing the messenger, decided to deliberately set the clock ahead by fifteen minutes so they could hang him anyway. Bit of a subversion, that.
</li><li> In 1913, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Frank">Leo Frank<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Jewish superintendent of a pencil factory in Atlanta, was convicted of murdering 13-year old Mary Phagan, one of the factory's workers, based on what would later turn out to be false testimony (by the prosecution's star witness, who in fact was the real killer). He was sentenced to death, but when suspicions arose that he was innocent, the governor commuted his sentence to life to allow for further investigation. However, even as concrete evidence that Frank was innocent surfaced, a group of men calling themselves "The Knights of Mary Phagan" broke into the prison, kidnapped Frank, and took him to the woods where he was lynched. Neither the real killer of Mary Phagan (a janitor at the factory named Jim Conley) or the killers of Frank (who turned out to be some of Georgia's most prominent citizens) were ever arrested, and the incident resulted in a resurgence of the Klan. In 1986, 71 years after his murder (and 73 after Mary Phagan's) and based off the testimony of a now-elderly eyewitness who had seen the real killer carrying the victim's body, the state of Georgia granted Leo Frank a posthumous pardon. Conley, in fact, had been initially arrested for murder (unsurprisingly, since he had blood on his shirt) but later became the star witness when he claimed it came from moving the body at Frank's request. His handwriting matched that on a note left near the body too (he claimed Frank dictated them). Given that he was black, this may have been the first time a white man was prosecuted in the South on this basis (antisemitism trumped anti-black racism here it seems). This case would become so famous that a musical, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Parade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Parade">Parade</a></em>, would be made about it.
</li><li> A military veteran named <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cole">Tim Cole<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was arrested and convicted of raping a fellow student in 1985 in Lubbock, Texas and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He died in prison of an asthma attack in 1999. The rape victim realized her mistake and told police that her attacker was smoking, and Tim could not smoke because of his asthma. After the statute of limitations on the crime had run out, the real rapist confessed to the crime. DNA testing proved Cole was innocent, and on February 6, 2009 - nearly ten years after his death - a Texas district court judge announced "to a 100 percent moral, factual and legal certainty" that Timothy Cole did not commit the rape. The judge reversed the conviction and ordered Cole's record expunged. A commission was also established to review past convictions that might have been wrongful and propose criminal justice reforms that could help prevent future occurrences.

Eleven years later, it emerged that a confession was beaten out of him and that evidence was withheld that would have acquitted the seven. Worse still, he had only been in England to help out his son, Gerry, one of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildford_Four_and_Maguire_Seven#Guildford_Four">The Guildford Four<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Gerry was released in 1989, his conviction having been quashed. Their story was the basis for the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTheNameOfTheFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTheNameOfTheFather">In the Name of the Father</a></em>.
</li><li> The notorious <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park_jogger_case">Central Park Jogger case<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. On April 19, 1989, investment banker Tricia Meili was brutally attacked in New York City's Central Park—raped, beaten, and left for dead. Five teenagers who had been harassing other people in the park that evening were soon arrested and charged with the crime. Despite no DNA evidence, no identification made by Meili (she survived, but could not recall the attack in detail), and most damning, a time frame that showed that the boys could NOT have attacked the woman — ironically, because they had been committing a lesser crime at the time — all were convicted. A little over a decade later, a man serving a life sentence for another crime confessed that <em>he</em> had attacked the jogger, and that he'd done so alone. Only one of the five was still in prison while the rest had served their time and been released. Despite their convictions being overturned, it is their unanimous belief that the entire experience has ruined their lives. Adding insult to injury, the statute of limitations has expired, meaning that the real perpetrator of one of the most infamous crimes in New York City history can never be prosecuted and that Meili will never see proper justice done on her behalf. A thoroughly gross miscarriage of justice all around.
</li><li> An example that does not involve capital punishment was the trial against Arthur Andersen LLC for their destruction of the files relating to Enron. To establish <em>obstruction of justice</em>, it was necessary for Arthur Andersen to <em>knowingly</em> and <em>corruptly</em> persuade their employees to destroy the documents — the Supreme Court held that they <em>must be conscious</em> that they were destroying the files illegally. The thing was, however, that Arthur Andersen was not aware that they were destroying the files illegally, yet the jury was originally instructed that <em>"even if petitioner honestly and sincerely believed its conduct was lawful, the jury could convict"</em> and therefore convicted Arthur Andersen. The Supreme Court later reversed the conviction, but it was too late. Arthur Andersen went from one of the largest auditing firms to practically going out of business.

Seventy years after he was executed, a judge ruled that he had not received a fair trial, as he was not effectively defended and his Sixth Amendment right had been violated, and executing a 14-year-old boy was extremely cruel. The only ones disappointed by the overturning of the ruling were the families of the murdered girls.
</li><li> Alan Turing was pardoned for indecency in 2013 by the Queen herself. He killed himself by eating a cyanide-laced apple in 1954 because he was sentenced to forced chemical castration and lost his livelihood due to the conviction.

While it's possible they were actually the killers, they certainly didn't get a fair trial... always a warning sign when the judge says in court that the defendant, even if not guilty, would "nevertheless [be] morally culpable because he is the enemy of our existing institutions." The evidence was conflicting, but the majority of historians and investigators feel the pair were innocent. However, an associate of theirs later said Sacco was there, meaning he may have been involved but Vanzetti wasn't. In one account, it was Sacco who'd actually shot the men, though both were involved in the robbery (Vanzetti would also be liable due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMurder">felony murder</a> if true). As both were part of the Galleanist anarchists, who had committed a number of bombings, it's also been speculated that US law enforcement prosecuted them to get at the group more than due to any evidence.
</li><li> While it's never been absolutely proven he didn't commit the crime, Cameron Todd Willingham's guilt was thrown into serious question shortly before his execution when experts discovered that much of the scientific evidence that had convicted him was invalid (he was convicted of murder by arson; fire scientists had determined that much of the "science" commonly used to establish arson was based on myths, and it was that supposed science on which the conviction was based).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bqhu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bqhu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bqhu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is before we get into the political aspects of the conviction involving the prosecutor, the reliability of the jailhouse informant who testified for the prosecution, and prejudiced and speculative testimony from a later-disgraced forensic psychologist in the penalty phase that likely contributed to the death penalty being handed down in the first place.</span> Governor Rick Scott refused to grant a stay of execution and Willingham was executed on February 17, 2004, despite the testimony of experts saying the conviction was almost certainly faulty.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">This is one of the reasons Italy has banned the death penalty</a>: a wrongfully imprisoned man can still be released, but a wrongfully executed man cannot be resurrected.
