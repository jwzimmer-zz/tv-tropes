<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The acquisition of Dragon Balls becomes increasingly trivial as the series goes on. While they were meant to be brought together only after a lifetime of searching by a very dedicated person, Bulma's Dragon Radar allows the heroes to collect them all within the span of a single story arc. Later sagas often have them acquired within the span of a single episode or even <em>offscreen</em> so that the heroes can deal with or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">clean up after</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <em>du jour</em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> introduces a second set of Dragon Balls on the planet Namek, which follow a similar progression, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> adds a third set of Dragon Balls—the Black Star Dragon Balls—but scatters them across the entire galaxy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">blows up the Earth</a> if they're not brought back within a year. Then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> introduced the Super Dragon Balls which are supposed to be the original set that created the Namekian Dragon Balls and they can grant <em>any</em> wish. They're much more difficult to gather since they're the size of planets and spread out across two entire universes. This was even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em>GT</em> with the Shadow Dragons, which are created from the buildup of negative energy in the Dragon Balls: it's explained that they were <em>supposed</em> to lay dormant for decades in between wishes so that energy could dissipate naturally, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">the heroes using them over and over in such a short span of time prevented that from happening</a>.
</li><li> From the same series is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan</a>. Goku used to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">only one in existence</a>. By the Buu saga, Vegeta's son Trunks and Goku's second son Goten could use the transformation before the age of ten without even being taught, and there were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">three different levels of transformation</a>. The former was mercilessly lampshaded by Vegeta; the irony of it is that Vegeta <em>himself</em> caused the trend by also becoming a Super Saiyan. It really says something when Frieza, who initially feared the transformation, was more surprised that Broly <em>can't</em> go Super Saiyan. However, this only really holds true for a normal Super Saiyan as each level have fewer people having access to it. Super Saiyan 2 is only used by Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Future Trunks, Caulifla and Cabba, the latter two hailing from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/DragonBallUniverse6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/DragonBallUniverse6">Universe 6</a>. Super Saiyan 3 is only gained by Goku and Gotenks. Only Goku ever becomes a Super Saiyan God — unless you count Vegeta in the manga and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></em> — and Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan/Super Saiyan Blue is currently exclusive to Goku and Vegeta. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vegeta also gets his own "evolved" form of Super Saiyan Blue during the Tournament of Power, though it's an anime-exclusive form and does not appear in the <em>Broly</em> film (which is set after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DragonBallSuperUniverseSurvivalArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DragonBallSuperUniverseSurvivalArc">Universe Surival arc</a>).</span>
</li><li> There's also the idea of Frieza as the most powerful being in the universe. For a time the show found ways to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> the increasingly powerful foes Goku had to face after him. The Androids and Cell didn't exist yet when Frieza was alive. The warriors Goku faced in the afterlife a) were dead and thus not counted against Frieza's claim of strongest IN the Universe, and b) had been training for thousands of years. The claim gets a bit shakier in the Buu Saga. Majin Buu had been sealed for so long that it's likely Frieza was simply unaware of him, but many of Babidi's henchmen, Dabura especially, seem likely to have been at least as strong as Frieza (although we don't have confirmed power levels for them and in Dabura's case he comes from a parallel world in the shadows of Earth). With the introduction of Beerus, who is well-known enough for Vegeta to be terrified of him, Frieza's claim seems downright delusional. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Resurrection 'F'</a></em> addresses this by having Frieza privately admit that he was warned to <em>absolutely never</em> try to fight either Buu or Beerus by his father, so his claim of being the "strongest in the universe" was likely propaganda from the beginning. Either that or what was meant was he was the strongest <em>mortal</em> being in the universe. During the movie, he also reveals that he was <em>never even trying</em> to improve his abilities, and when he does, he actually reclaims his title as strongest (mortal) fighter in the universe, although he still fears Beerus.
</li><li> The Kamehameha was originally introduced as the ultimate ki technique of the Muten Roshi, one of such complexity that it took him fifty years to perfect it. Goku does it on his first try, and it becomes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a>. By the 22nd tournament Yamcha reveals he learned, and mastered it, and Krillin learns and masters it as well a few chapters/episodes. Later Goku's own children master it even earlier.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Hadron Cannon</a> was an experimental weapon capable of destroying a small army, and only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Knightmare Frame</a> Gawain had it; at the same time, it was one of only three Knightmares with the ability to fly. By the second season there had been a one year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, however, and suddenly a bunch of Knightmares had Hadron Cannons equipped, and by the end there were barely any Knightmares that <em>couldn't</em> fly. Takes a turn for the bizarre in the finale, when one of the Knightmares flying around is clearly a Portman (a dedicated Knightmare <em>submarine</em>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>: The Stand Bow and its Arrows allowed several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High School Students</a>, prison inmates, <em>the Mafia</em> and many others to acquire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit">Stands</a> where they wouldn't have otherwise. The Arrows had the limitation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly">killing anyone without the spiritual strength necessary to control a Stand</a>, but Josuke of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">Part 4</a> got around this in one case by healing the dying Koichi after he was pricked by an Arrow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> was unique to the Yamato itself, though their enemies had rough equivalents to it in the first series (like the Dessler Gun). From the second series onward, Wave Motion technology would spread to the rest of the Cosmo Navy.
</li><li> Subverted in the remake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199">Space Battleship Yamato 2199</a></em>, where the Dessler Cannon was still the only thing even close to matching the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> in sheer destructive potential. Then played immediately straight in the follow-up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2202" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2202">Space Battleship Yamato 2202</a></em>, where <em>every Cosmo Navy warship</em> had some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> mounted on its bow.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>: You stole a giant robot, making you the most dangerous humans on the planet? Good idea; now we've all done the same in imitation! What, now you've learned to combine them and wield superhuman power? We'll all start doing that too!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 8 Chosen Children were the only people with Digivices and Digimon partners. It appears now that, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, there are hundreds, or maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenMany">thousands of chosen children</a> all over the world, each with a Digivice and a Digimon partner. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, in the end, everyone in the world has a Digimon partner.</span>
</li><li> In the franchise as a whole, a certain mon will be introduced as having developed under special circumstances. They'll be a regular part of the universe in other, unrelated series, though. For example, Armor Digivolving in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> is an ancient method that the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Ken, can't shut down with his Control Spires because, well, a virus made to take out a computer using Windows 8 probably wouldn't work on a TRS-80. The only Armor Digimon are the armor forms of our heroes. <em>Not</em> so the later series, where Armors are everywhere. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em>, Guilmon was created from scratch by Takato. No others exist and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyScan">Digimon Analyzer sequence</a> basically amounts to "huh? What do you mean, 'no data?'" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em> has forms of Guilmon as Digimon elementary school students.
</li><li> Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Mons</a> of the main ones' races are rare within their series but not outside of it. Unlike Armors or Guilmon, there's no in-universe reason why we don't see any other Gomamon in the series where one is a main character... but we don't. However, there's a whole tribe of them in Frontier. Out of universe, it's probably because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a> is in effect.
</li><li> Then there's Mega Digimon in general. In <em>Adventure,</em> the stage <em>before</em> Mega is considered fully evolved. Megas always happened through special circumstances; Venom Myotismon had a prophecy going for him (and having his bats eat the data of <em>all</em> his minions and infuse him with it helped.) Metal Etemon had fallen into and absorbed the entirety of the Dark Network, Saber Leomon had been exposed to a metric buttload of Digivice energy. Then there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> quartet that's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods">The Four Gods</a>, the heroes' Digivice-induced Mega forms, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods">The Four Gods</a> themselves. Your average joe will probably <em>never</em> be a Mega; Ultimate is fully evolved and Mega happens through either help or basically being a god. But outside the Adventure-verse, civilian Megas are quite common, and <em>all</em> the heroes getting to go Mega is <em>expected.</em>

</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, the Gundam itself is suggested to be a unique unit. Sure, the mass-produced GMs are the same design, but they look different enough to keep the Gundam special. Later UC continuity side stories, OVAs, and video games have introduced as many as twenty other Gundams running around during the One Year War, though none of them achieve the same level of notoriety. This is given some explanation later: Gundam-class Mobile Suits are much more expensive to produce than GMs, given that their specs are so much greater than standard GMs'; they're treated much the same way as F-14 Tomcats were, and given only to aces. This is demonstrated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em>, where Delta-Plus-type (based on the Gundam Mk-II) and Zeta-Plus-type Gundam Class Mobile Suits are seen as non-unique mobile suits, but are still far fewer than the standard-issue current-generation GM models.

However, she admits at the time that she's never encountered one before and her knowledge comes from a school text book. It's eventually revealed that there are three levels to a Menos Grande, the lowest rank having been the first introduced. The top level Shinigami (captains, lieutenants and lower ranked officers who have been acknowledged in-universe as being as powerful as lieutenants) can fight Gillian and Adjuchas ranks easily enough, but the Vasto Lorde rank is so powerful, even a captain will struggle to win.

In the first half of the Grand Line ("Paradise") and any of the Blue Seas, a Logia user would be highly feared and dangerous, as they can turn into an element, such as fire or electricity, and allow physical attacks to pass through. In the second half of the Grand Line ("The New World"), Logia users have substantially shorter lifespans because many of them don't seem to get that everybody can hit you there thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">haki</a>, demonstrated when one such character gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomped</a> by someone better prepared while explaining that to the Logia user.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In early seasons, Legendary and Mythical Pokémon could not be truly caught and controlled by anyone, and appeared only in important episodes and movies. They were also nearly invulnerable, and were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> on one level or another. Later seasons have them appear in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> episodes and tamed by trainers (even Ash himself caught a Meltan in the <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> series), as well as having them frequently sent into battle and getting defeated like other Pokémon. In addition, what were once implied to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleSpecimenSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleSpecimenSpecies">Single Specimen Species</a> had multiple specimens appear (even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonGenesectAndTheLegendAwakened" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonGenesectAndTheLegendAwakened">if it made no logical sense</a>), which were almost always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">weaker/less impressive than the one that first appeared</a> (usually by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">Pokémon Speak</a> as opposed to telepathy). Compare Shaymin's handling in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonGiratinaAndTheSkyWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonGiratinaAndTheSkyWarrior">Giratina and the Sky Warrior</a></em> to the one owned by Mallow in the <em>Sun and Moon</em> series for example, or Lucario's ongoing depiction since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonLucarioAndTheMysteryOfMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonLucarioAndTheMysteryOfMew">Lucario and the Mystery of Mew</a></em>.
</li><li> In a similar vein, there's Pokémon who can use telepathy to talk. For the first few movies, it was restricted to powerful Psychic type <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">Mewtwo</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000">Lugia</a> (as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon3">an illusionary Entei</a>). As the films went on, however, telepathy became dime a dozen among Pokémon that needed to speak for plot convenience, even those that weren't Psychic or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a>. It eventually reached a head towards the end of the <em>Best Wishes</em> movies, which had no less than FIVE Pokémon with the ability.
</li><li> Team Rocket's Meowth being able to stand on two legs was very unusual. Meowth are strictly quadrupedal... Or at least they were at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentCharacterDesignDifference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentCharacterDesignDifference">start of the series</a>. In the games they have always been bipedal in their sprites however their stance implied they were not used to being bipedal, much like a real cat trying to balance on their hindlegs. As time went on they've been designed as completely bipedal and walk perfectly fine on their hindlegs. This means that Meowth's backstory about being a Meowth who trained himself to walk on two-legs isn't quite unique anymore. Meowth rarely appear in the anime so this isn't too noticeable, though Tyson's Meowth from Hoenn was shown to inexplicably walk on two legs without anyone questioning it and no one comments on the Alolan Meowth being bipedal either.
</li><li> When introduced, Togepi was a very rare Pokémon and its line was all-but unheard of. It stayed this way for years, but over time its rarity has decreased. An <em>AG</em> two-parter featured a small kingdom that revered Togepi, with dozens appearing there. <em>DP</em> had a filler villain be an evil Togepi, while the line's final evolution Togekiss was given to Dawn near the end of the series (a commonality in part because in the games Cynthia gives the protagonist a Togepi egg) without much fanfare.
</li><li> In the games, each region has eight Gym Leaders and they're amongst the best of the best. The anime waters this down a bit by showing that more Leaders exist beyond these eight. The position of "Gym Leader" is not quite as rare and exclusive as it is in the games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the early days, the Blue-Eyes White Dragon (a 3000 ATK Normal Monster) was stated to be so rare and powerful that only four were ever printed, and one of them was destroyed so it couldn't be used against the wielder of the other three. By Duelist Kingdom, we see Chaos Soldier (equal in strength to Blue-Eyes) and Black Daemon's Dragon (slightly stronger), though both had specialized requirements and Blue-Eyes didn't. By Battle City, two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mooks</a> were using Masked Beast and Masked Beast Death Guardius, both of which were stronger, Haga had Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth, Yugi had Valkyrion, and so on. By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> rolled around, just about everybody had a card that was at least as strong as Blue-Eyes, often with some kind of special ability. Blue-Eyes herself remains unique, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">strongest Normal Monster</a>, but she's hardly anything that would be banned from the game.
</li><li> Extra Deck methods have also become increasingly more common. In the original manga, only a few characters (Yugi, Kaiba, Jounouchi, Pegasus, Marik) used Fusion, and it was never their primary strategy. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>, Fusion Summoning became a lot more common, and the primary strategy for some characters, but there were still plenty of people who didn't use it, several of whom were main characters. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>, Synchro Summoning was used by every single main character and most of the important ones, but there were still a good number of characters, mostly one-off villains, who didn't use it. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em>, a grand total of four characters (three of whom were using the same deck and all of whom used Fusion anyway) didn't use Xyz Summoning, and everyone else and their dog (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">quite literally, in at least one case</a>) used it as their primary strategy. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em> actually takes a step back by declaring Extra Deck methods to be quite rare, limiting it to characters connected to LDS or to the various other dimensions (which, granted, is most of the main characters again).
</li><li> In <em>ARC-V</em>, it is actually a plot point that Reiji studies Pendulum Cards (cards unique to only Yuya) so he can mass-produce them. The Battle Royale features Pendulum Cards that litter the entire city, and by the next arc, many of the main characters received Pendulum Monsters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS">VRAINS</a></em> established that every Duelist has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Skills</a>, and Playmaker is the only one to have the Skill "Storm Access", a skill that gets him new Extra Deck monsters in the middle of a speed duel. Then Revolver gets the same skill for some reason. Come Season 2, Storm Access becomes so prevalent, that one starts to expect everyone to just use it.

Then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid">ViVid</a></em> introduced three other characters who could do so, and while two of them also had connections to Ancient Belka, the third has no such legacy. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike">ViVid Strike!</a></em>, it seems like every fighter that hasn't finished puberty uses it.
</li><li> Inverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flight">Flight</a>. For the first two seasons, the ability to fly appeared to be a rather standard skill for mages to have. Then <em>StrikerS</em> showed that being able to fly was actually really rare (only a few of the new characters can do so and none of them are protagonists). <em>ViVid</em> only had one, <em>ViVid Strike!</em> didn't introduce any.
</li></ul></li><li> Originally Nate from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> and the only human besides his grandfather Nathaniel to own a Yo-kai Watch.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zoids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zoids">Zoids</a></em> has a habit of introducing new Zoids that are described as unique, top-of-the-line, and nigh-unstoppable, only for the next series to show entire groups of them, often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">falling prey</a> to whatever new Zoids are introduced in that series.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZoidsChaoticCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZoidsChaoticCentury">Zoids: Chaotic Century</a></em>, the Lightning Saix was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> that only Irvine was capable of piloting, and even then, only when he uploaded the combat data from his old Command Wolf, essentially making it an upgrade to that Zoid. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZoidsNewCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZoidsNewCentury">New Century</a></em>, there exists a team of <em>three</em> Lightning Saixes.
</li><li> Also in <em>Chaotic Century</em>, the Geno Saurer was a scaled-down version of the Death Saurer, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostSuperweapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostSuperweapon">Lost Superweapon</a> of a Zoid and one of the few Zoids <em>not</em> to fall victim to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> in later series.

Over time, the number of non-hunters who could use Nen increased and membership in the Hunters Association became less special. This is especially noticeable in the Greed Island and Chimera Ant arcs. The former features an entire competition of Nen users, most of whom are nothing special and the latter features an invasive species that can learn to use nen more quickly and easily than humans.

And that's not including any symbiote, nor all the other spider-people we saw running around in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em>:
<ul><li> Similar to Green Lantern noted above, when Jay Garrick was first introduced it was kind of novel to have a character with simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> as their only power, though this lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfExpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfExpies">Fountain of Expies</a> with Quicksilver (Quality Comics', who was later acquired by DC) and Johnny Quick introduced before the Golden Age was up. Then comes the Silver Age and we get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a> Barry Allen, and his nephew/protege <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest">Wally West</a>, and after a short while Jay is reintroduced. After COIE Wally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGraduationsStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGraduationsStick">became The Flash</a>, and during his time many other speedsters were introduced too. This was actually taken advantage of, as after the aforementioned Golden Age speedsters were revived and reintroduced (renaming Quicksilver to Max Mercury to avoid confusion with the Marvel character), as well as having Johnny's daughter Jesse introduced, the older figures began mentoring Wally, Jesse, and Bart (Barry's grandson from the future), creating a 'Flash Family'. As the group have diverse personalities, and different strengths and weaknesses, this actually worked amazingly for creating a super-team who all have the same basic power but still feel individually unique and interesting.
</li><li> The act of leaving the Speed Force has became this. Mark Waid, who introduced the Speed Force, had it so Wally West is the first person to ever leave it because of his love for Linda Park. However, he establishes that it's a near-impossible thing to do, and that a being can't exist in the Speed Force for too long without just merging with it. Wally does it one more time in Waid's run, when he gets stuck in the Speed Force after Abra Kadabra retcons Linda from existence and, again, he's forced to go too fast. Being in the Speed Force, spanning multiple realities, allowed Wally to see what had happened and he appears to Linda again in the alternate reality she became stranded in. That's it. Then Geoff Johns came along, and being "lost to the Speed Force" keeps everyone perfectly intact, so we have Barry Allen popping out of it to help Bart after <em>20 years</em> of being stuck inside it. Johns' <em>JSA</em> run had the Rival, a speedster last seen in the 40s, somehow escape it without explanation. In Johns' <em>Legion of Three Worlds</em>, Brainiac 5 is somehow able to bring Bart back, and his personality and body were intact. Later, in Johns' <em>The Flash: Rebirth</em>, we see that Max Mercury and Johnny Quick, lost to the Speed Force <em>over a decade earlier</em>, were also intact and Max was able to return by basically holding Barry's hand while Barry was holding Wally's, when Wally went in to pull Barry out. This is all a far cry from the huge threat of the Speed Force removing someone's individuality and the undying, true love required to escape it. He somewhat fixes things in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Universe: Rebirth</a></em> #1, where Wally is barely able to escape thanks to Barry's friendship... then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth">Titans (Rebirth)</a></em> by Dan Abnett has Wally lost to the Speed Force <em>in its first arc</em> and the <em>only</em> thing keeping him there is a hallucination (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">or not</a>) of Linda Park, and he can leave it as soon as he wants to because of his friendship with the Titans. He does this <em>again</em> when his cousin goes into the Speed Force to save Deathstroke, managing to pull both out. By this point, the Speed Force is basically where speedsters go for a nap.
</li><li> The entire concept of the Reverse-Flash, who are supposed to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> speedsters to whatever Flash they're fighting. The first, unofficial Reverse-Flash was Edward Clariss (the Rival), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> to Jay Garrick. Then when the Silver Age happened, second Flash Barry Allen was given an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> in Eobard Thawne, the first official Reverse-Flash. But by the time Wally West was the Flash, evil speedsters became commonplace, with villains like Speed Demon, Savitar, Lady Savitar and the Black Flash (kinda). Meanwhile, the younger Bart Allen got Thadeus Thawne (Inertia) as his pseudo-Reverse-Flash. While all but Inertia and the Black Flash (who wasn't so much a person as a force of nature and the embodiment of death, meaning he wasn't used much anyway) were done away with, and Geoff Johns gave Wally a true evil counterpart in the second official Reverse-Flash, Hunter Zolomon. He also introduced us to Hot Pursuit later on once Barry Allen returned. Post-Flashpoint, DC created more evil speedsters, first with the new Reverse-Flash (Daniel West) to fill in the vacancies left by Clariss, Thawne, Zolomon and Thadeus, more were later introduced. These include Future Flash (an alternate timeline Barry Allen), a new version of Eobard Thawne, Godspeed and Negative Flash. Because the number of evil speedsters now far surpasses that of the number of Reverse-Flashes, their place as <em>the</em> evil speedsters doesn't mean much, and it's other things that make them stand out — Eobard killed Iris West, then later Barry's mother which led to Flashpoint; while Hunter is established as being <em>the</em> fastest being in existence, and causing Linda Park's miscarriage.

First, there was just Knuckles. Then, we're introduced to his uncle, the power-mad Enerjak, and learn that Knux's father, Locke, was alive. Then, there's Athair, a former Guardian-turned-mystic. Then, we're introduced to the Dark Legion right before Echidnaopolis reappears with an entire <em>city</em> of Echidnas. Then, we learn that Athair is leading an entire tribe of echidnas to a mystical city of Echidnas. Before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, we had Echidnas coming out of the woodwork. The time skip culled them down and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> reset it back to how it was.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em> hedgehogs are spiky and brown. Sonic turned blue in the same accident that gave him superspeed. Amy is pink furred but it wasn't initially explained why (though her fashion-savvy nature might suggest she dyes her fur). The 1998 story "Amy's Secret Past" finally gave a reason: years ago, Robotnik was building a machine to emulate Sonic's powers. Amy (already a tomboyish Freedom Fighter despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">it being too early for that</a>) caught wind of it and stopped him. Amy was thrown into the machine, which fused her quills and turned her pink.
</li></ul></li><li> In IDW's <em>Transformers</em> comics, when Nova Prime was first revealed to be evil, during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMegaseries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMegaseries">Spotlight: Optimus Prime</a></em>, this was a dramatic revelation, the notion that a Prime could be evil, that Optimus' forebears could've been corrupt. Then, some years down the line, Sentinel and Zeta Prime were also revealed to be corrupt and evil, with Optimus having known about this all along, and that Nova had directly instituted the systems that made pre-war Cybertron such a terrible place to live in the first place.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This claim is even more suspect with the introductions of Liege Maximo and Onyx Prime, the former of whom being "the Prime of Lies" and the latter revealed to actually be a time-displaced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Shockwave.</a></span>
</li><li> Time travel became this over the course of the series. It first appeared as a complete oddity associated with one planet where time flowed out of order and time machines are introduced as a super rare find, with one character spending millions of years to develop one. Eventually, a specific area of space is introduced that makes time travel much easier and predictable.
</li><li> The Transformers themselves fall into this. The Great War and the destruction of Cybertron are portrayed as especially catastrophic in this continuity, with number of remaining Cybertronians numbering around ten thousand. Then, Cybertron is healed and the neutrals come home dramatically increasing the population and then after that colony worlds from before the war are introduced which swell the ranks further.

</li><li> Played straight, however, in regards to the Asgardians of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor">Thor</a></em> series in the wide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a>.

Outside of that, it was largely oriented on humans, and no other race was considered as such importance as the Asgardians. The two <em>Guardians</em> films introduced other exceptionally-powerful alien species—in particular, the god-like Celestials. Phase 3 expanded the cosmic races further in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a></em>, and with the reveal of the Kree and the Skrull in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel">Captain Marvel</a></em>. Phase 4 and Phase 5 are set to introduce not not one, not two, but <em>three</em> additional superpowered races as important to the setting: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEternals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEternals">Eternals</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blade">Vampires</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">Mutants</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The rancor beast from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> was originally described in the novelization as a mysterious, possibly mutated creature: <em>"The size of an elephant, it was somehow reptilian, somehow as unformed as a nightmare. Its huge screeching mouth was asymmetrical in its head, its fangs and claws set all out of proportion. It was clearly a mutant, and wild as all unreason."</em> Nevertheless, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">rancors being awesome</a>, they quickly proliferated through the Expanded Universe. Later the 1994 novel <em>The Courtship of Princess Leia</em> introduced the previously undiscovered planet of Dathomir, to which the rancors are native. And it turns out that Jabba's rancor in <em>Return of the Jedi</em> was actually a <em>small</em> example of the species. Dathomir itself then propagated in the EU, to the point that the 2004 novel <em>Ruins of Dantooine</em> included Dathomirian beasts, a common biologist with detailed knowledge of Dathomir's ecosystem, and other characters who'd apparently been to the planet ... 8 in-universe years before the planet became known beyond a small circle of individuals.
</li><li> Grand Admiral Thrawn was initially presented as a member of an unknown species, established after 8 years OOU and 10 IU timeline years as the heretofore reclusive Chiss species from the Unknown Regions. After this, of course, Chiss proliferated in the EU, most recently and egregiously in the novel <em>Darth Bane: Path of Destruction</em> a full <em>1000 years</em> before the species was supposed to have been known to the galaxy at large. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>, the Chiss are running around over 3,500 years before they're officially supposed to be known (although there was a galactic dark age shortly after this era so the records could have just been lost).
</li><li> Obi-wan Kenobi and Yoda were intended to be the last surviving Jedi from the old Jedi Order, period. Of course, it didn't take long for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> authors to start creating their own survivors who went into hiding or were mysteriously overlooked. Not to mention the hundreds of Sith all over the place.
</li><li> Force Lightning. At first, it was a very rare power only the most veteran and skilled Sith had, which was a testament of their power. In the EU, either be books, comics or (especially) video games, every Sith (or just a Darksider) can use Force Lightning, and thus becoming so common that it replaced the Force Choke as the signature ability of the Dark Side. Taken to a ridiculous degree in some works where <em>Jedi</em> can use it was well. Luke himself uses a variant of it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">New Jedi Order</a></em> that is instantly lethal. This could mean that Force Lightning is something that any sufficiently powerful Force-user could wield, but the Jedi generally refuse to because it's basically made only to cause extreme pain.
</li><li> This is actually discussed about the Sith in the Darth Bane trilogy of books. Bane realizes that having more than two Sith Lords at any one time spreads the dark side of the Force too thinly, and the Sith as a whole are weakened because the Sith crave power to the point that they're willing to jeopardize their plans for galactic domination just to get a leg up on their rivals and thus leave the Sith vulnerable. Given how many times Sith empires had collapsed for precisely this reason, Bane clearly had a point. The line of reasoning behind the Rule of Two (that there should only be one master and one apprentice) is that there is one Sith to embody power, and a second to crave it.
</li><li> Specifically related to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends continuity</a>:
<ul><li> Cortosis ore. Originally introduced as a rare mineral that was difficult to work with, impractical for armor (due to its weight and softness), and with the specific power to merely turn off lightsabers (and even then, they can cause it small amounts of damage), Cortosis was eventually <em>woven</em> (sorry) into the rest of the EU as part of something called "Cortosis weave", a process that allows weapons and armor to resist lightsabers. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Old Republic</a> games in particular treat Cortosis as one of the most common materials in the universe, judging by how well standard swords and armor stand up against it.
</li><li> The Kyber Crystal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SplinterOfTheMindsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SplinterOfTheMindsEye">Originally</a>, the Kaiburr crystal was a single unique gem that could enhance one's connection to the Force. Eventually, someone made the connection that lightsabers have crystals, so why not take part of the Kaiburr crystal and make a lightsaber out of it? By the time of the reboot, "Kyber" had become <em>a kind of crystal</em>, one of many that was suitable for lightsaber construction. As of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">the new continuity</a>, Kyber has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">become</a> <em>the</em> kind of crystal that lightsabers (and, ultimately, the Death Star) are made with.
</li><li> Hilarious example with Boba Fett.

<ul><li> In the second book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></em>, the creation of a Polyjuice Potion is stated to be a very difficult and time consuming process, needing a full month to prepare. That Hermione managed to prepare it in her second year at Hogwarts is treated as something extraordinary. After the second book, however, the potion becomes one of the most commonly used potions throughout the series, playing a part in four of the seven books.
</li><li> Throughout the third book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em>, Harry is told the difficulty of performing the Patronus Charm and it is implied only powerful/very skilled wizards can use the advanced spirit animal form. Yet many characters are shown with them, and by the end of the fifth book Harry has taught it to a bunch of his classmates. The power of the Patronus varied greatly between characters though. And Harry states when he's training his classmates that it's a lot harder to produce a Patronus when you're facing down a Dementor. This gets demonstrated in the seventh book.

<ul><li> It is many times mentioned how few <em>Greek</em> half bloods there are, even before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luke</span> starts recruiting them. Yet in the <em>Heroes of Olympus</em> series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a whole new <em>Roman</em> camp is revealed, with not only more demigods, but children of demigods, and children of children of demigods</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>, everyone who knew both camps all swore upon the river Styx to never speak of it and the Gods tried their hardest to keep them separated.
</li><li> In <em>The Lightning Thief</em>, Percy being a son of Poseidon is a big deal, because Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades swore not to have anymore demigod children after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. While Zeus broke the pact first, his daughter Thalia is dead by the time the series begins... but she's brought back to life at the end of the second book, and the <em>third</em> book introduces Bianca and Nico di Angelo, two children of Hades that were born before the pact, but are still young because their father hid them in a time-warp. Bianca is promptly killed off, but the sequel series gives Thalia and Nico each a new sibling, bringing the total to five. Justified because the central plot of the story revolves around a prophecy concerning a child of Poseidon, Zeus, or Hades, and it would be <em>really</em> boring if Percy was automatically it. (He <em>is</em> it, but...)
</li><li> At first, half bloods had to pray to their parent, or focus most of their energy to use powers like lightning bolts or huge waves. But by the final battle, Jason manages to summon a storm, and Leo enough fire, to defeat Gaia, without breaking a sweat.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>, Rand is the only character on the side of good who can Travel (create gateways to travel to other places instantly) during the fifth book. After he explains it to Egwene in the sixth book, she discovers the female version and teaches the Aes Sedai at Salidar. He also shows it to Mazrim Taim, who teaches the weave to the Asha'man.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy">Vampire Academy</a></em>, Lissa and Rose are introduced as a rare spirit user and shadow-kissed pair. They have to figure out what they are and the nature of their powers through studying the lives of Medieval predecessors Saint Vladimir and Anna. As well as knowing an elder spirit user in teacher Sonya Karp. They are hinted to be the first spirit users in centuries. Later books introduce spirit users Adrian Ivashkov, Oksana, Avery Lazar, and Robert Doru. There are even some unnamed, insane spirit users incarcerated in Tarasov prison. Suddenly Lissa does not seem so unique anymore. And as for shadow-kissed characters there are Mark (Oksana's bondmate), Alden (Robert Doru's deceased bondmate) and Reed Lazar and Simon (Avery Lazar's bondmate). Making Rose less unique as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> sees the Star Kingdom of Manticore develop, over many years, completely game-changing weapons and tactics, like multi-drive missiles, Ghost Rider, LAC swarms that actually work and more, to win the war in a single hammering campaign, Operation Buttercup, as their unstoppable Eighth Fleet drives hard and fast for the Haven capitol planet. Five years later, everyone whose anyone has frantically worked to duplicate, counter or improve upon Manticore's superweapons. Which is admittedly realistic.

Over time, more and more cats have been named with it, making it lose its uniqueness.
</li><li> Portrayed in-universe in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AcornaSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AcornaSeries">Acorna Series</a> novel: Acorna's three human guardians are trying to keep her out of the clutches of Hafiz Harakamian (The uncle of one of the guardians). Hafiz is a collecter of rare and unique items and sought to make Acorna the crown jewel of his collection. A desire that evaporates near the end of the book, when everyone finds out Acorna is a member of an alien race, not a one-of-a-kind mutant girl. Hafiz masks this by making a show of relinquishing his pursuits.

Then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> has a whole arc in which <em>one</em> Starfleet ship has to fight and/or sneak into Borg space solo, and <em>succeeds</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">This does make sense</a>, though; Starfleet learned some painful lessons from their initial run-ins with the Borg and were a lot better prepared in subsequent encounters. These subsequent Borg encounters also reveal that all growth in Borg abilities comes from assimilating the technology of others and directly experiencing their tactics. Innovation is simply beyond their ability; the Borg are purely reactive.
<ul><li> This also happened with warp core breaches. Originally introduced in the episode "Contagion", it was stated as an <em>extremely</em> unlikely occurrence due to the numerous fail-safe systems designed specifically to keep it from happening. Then the show's writers realized that a "warp core breach" was synonymous with "imminent danger", and they started happening with a depressing regularity, to the point that warp cores have an ejection system built into them. Apparently, all those fail-safe systems suddenly became useless.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the early years we knew almost nothing about The Doctor's people - it was six years before we learned the name "Time Lords". From the Tom Baker serial <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E3TheDeadlyAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS14E3TheDeadlyAssassin">The Deadly Assassin</a></em> onwards, we began to learn more and actually visited Gallifrey. Over the next decade or so, more stories featuring the corrupt, self-interested and machiavellian Time Lords were made, to the point where many fans complained that too much was being explained and the mystery had gone. One of the objectives of the so-called "Cartmel Masterplan" was to reintroduce the mystery regarding the Doctor himself by retconning much of what we knew about him to be a lie and implying that he was a much more powerful figure than a "mere" Time Lord.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3o15a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3o15a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3o15a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The series was canceled before the arc was completed and continued in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures">the subsequent novels</a></span>.
</li><li> The new series managed to bring this back a bit, by having them all supposedly killed off. This means that for modern fans, any slight suggestion that there might be another one out there is incredibly exciting. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They've since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime">come back, had their return thwarted</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">been saved, lost</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2013CSTheTimeOfTheDoctor">found, lost again</a>, and then eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent">wandered back on their own</a> as of the end of series 9. Then Series 12 entirely undid all the decay by revealing that not only is the Doctor the lynchpin of Time Lord society, she is an entirely different species that we have not seen other members of.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>:
<ul><li> The introduction of the Devil's Trap at the end of Season One. Apparently Sam and Dean, two of the most experienced hunters out there, not to mention their father, didn't know about a magic chalk circle which could trap demons. As soon as Bobby uses it, suddenly everyone with even basic awareness of demons can make one, and it starts appearing everywhere as a primary security measure.
</li><li> This also happened with demon-killing weapons. In the first couple seasons, the only thing known to be able to kill a demon was an enchanted Colt Revolver made by Samuel Colt under very special circumstances (it's mentioned that, among other things, it was crafted during the battle of the Alamo, and while Halley's Comet was overhead). It had only 13 bullets, 8 of which had already been used by the time the heroes got their hands on it, and once all the bullets were used the gun would be worthless. However, in season 3 the heroes figured out a way to make new bullets for the Colt, and also came into possession of a demon-killing knife. Then season 4 introduced angels, who can kill most demons just by touching them, as well as allowing Sam to kill them with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>. By season 8, it had been revealed the blades carried by angels could also kill demons, even when wielded by non-angelic beings. Cue just about every major character obtaining an angel blade offscreen. Then season 10 introduces the witch Rowena who invented the spell "Defigere Et Depurgare" that can easily liquefies demons.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a>:
<ul><li> The Stargate is a wondrous piece of technology on which the fate of humanity rests when it is first found, only to become increasingly trivial as time goes on; by the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">SG-1</a></em>, Earth had picked up a few dozen from uninhabited worlds to make a bridge between galaxies, then just left them there when the project fell through. They took one as a replacement when their gate blew up.
</li><li> Stargate is <em>full</em> of this trope. Amazing and unique devices that wowed and shocked us three episodes ago are now commonplace. One of a kind cloaking devices? Now comes standard on every model. Fast hyperspace travel? Every little podunk space ship has got one. The list could go on. This is mostly justified in universe as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">Humans Are Special</a>, or more specifically, the Tau'ri are special and every other culture is static, and that the whole point of the SG teams going out into the universe is to acquire tech, which sort of somehow ends up in the hands of everyone... This is good in the sense that Earth develops technologically over time, becoming something of a superpower, thereby avoiding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> plaguing many science fiction universes. On the other hand, it leads to massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">power creep</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> has its own little odd twist: the Icarus base required the power of a planet with an ultra-super rare one of a kind naquadria core. One more was found by the Lucian Alliance, and it turned out that Jonas's homeworld was also a suitable candidate (understandably, they objected to a procedure that might blow up their planet). Mind you, naquadria, when first introduced, was explicitly an artificially-created variant of stable naquadah that only existed on Jonas's homeworld because the Goa'uld that invented it set up shop there. It is not supposed to be naturally occurring.
</li><li> Ra was introduced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">the movie</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Last of His Kind</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> put the lie to this in the first episode.

By the time both series ended, there seemed to be a new way to kill a god every week. One of them was an axe to the back thrown by a mortal woman.
</li><li> In Volume 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> there was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Super Serum</a> had been industrialized and everyone has superpowers... even the terrorists</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>:</em>
<ul><li> "One girl in all the world, a Chosen One. She alone will wield the strength and skill to fight the vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness." Over the course of the series, it was revealed that there are actually a lot of people fighting the forces of darkness. In addition to the Watcher's Council there were numerous ancient orders of both warriors and mystics, the United States government, independent unaffiliated demon hunters, even good demons.
</li><li> Halfway through the second season a <em>second</em> slayer shows up; and then, in the finale, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they cast a spell that allows thousands of girls across the world to become Slayers at once</span>. It also turns out there was never any mechanical reason for the "one slayer" rule, it was just the wizards who first created the slayer line didn't think they could control more than one at a time.
</li><li> Angel being the vampire with a soul also becomes less unique when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Spike gets his soul back too.</span> This also plays havoc on several prophecies that didn't specify which one.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> does this with the ability to travel between the worlds.
<ul><li> In the pilot there're apparently only two ways to travel from the Enchanted Forest to the real world: the Dark Curse casted by the Evil Queen and the magic wardrobe made from a magical tree that allows Emma <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Pinocchio</span> to escape. Then halfway the first season we learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rumplelstilskin's son fell into a portal created with a magic bean and landed in the real world</span>. This supposedly explains why Rumple has been planning to cast the Curse for decades <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">manipulating everyone in the process</a> but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">brings the question why didn't he just seek for another magic bean?</a>. Later the series introduces new more conveniantly means to travel between the realms: Jefferson's hat (though this apparently can't reach the real world), Dorothy's silver slippers, a magic door and a wand created by the most powerful sorcerer. The white rabbit in the spin-off, the mermaids and the Author of the book also all have the ability to world cross at will.
</li><li> Magic beans are an example of this as well. The first one we see is stated to be the last in the realm. Then this turns out to be wrong and they are now rare, but apparently not too difficult to find.
</li><li> By the time Season 7 rolls around, copious amounts of world-hopping between Another Realm, the Wish Realm, the Enchanted Forest, Wonderland, and Oz is required to make any sense of the fantasy-world backstory, but it's become such a mundane ability that much of it is either unexplained or hand-waved.
</li><li> Season 6 has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> multiple Saviours. Turns out that Saviours are people with a specific kind of magic power and there have been many in the past.</span>

<ul><li> The series starts with just Barry having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>. Pretty quickly, the Reverse-Flash is introduced (in fact, he's, technically, shown in the pilot, but we don't know it's him and only see a vague fast-moving outline). Then from Season 2 Onwards, we're introduced to Zoom, Jay Garrick, Wally West, and Jesse Quick, and Savitar <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> though he turns out to be an alternate future version of Barry himself</span>. There's also Trajectory, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Villain of the Week</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who got her powers from taking Velocity-9</span>, and a cameo appearance of Accelerated Man, the Flash of Earth-19. And near the end of Season 4, we learn that the mysterious girl who's been showing up is also a speedster, and in the last episode she reveals herself to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Barry and Iris' daughter from the future</span>.
</li><li> This also applies to metahumans in general. In the pilot, after Barry awakens from his 9-month coma and discovers he can move fast, he finds out that there is another metahuman out there, Clyde Mardon. When they fight, Mardon tells Barry he never expected to meet another one like him. So this means that there have been no cases of metahumans in 9 months? Then, suddenly, there's a new metahuman threat every week. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And certain friends of Barry's also turn out to be metahumans</span>.
</li><li> There's also Gideon, the one-of-a-kind AI developed by Barry in the future and stolen by the Reverse-Flash. Then comes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em>, and we find out that a Gideon-like AI (one of which is named Gideon but has a different voice) comes standard-issue on all Time Master ships. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Chronos</a> has one.

Several other Inhuman characters remark on what a unique power this is and that as far as they know, no other Inhuman has ever had it before. One season later, another Inhuman with the same power is introduced. And then later his daughter is revealed to be clairvoyant too. It should be noted that they all function slightly differently: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Raina</span> is a straightforward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seer">Seer</a>, the second gets glimpses of a specific person's future if he makes physical contact with them, and the third is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLinearCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLinearCharacter">Non-Linear Character</a>.
</li><li> The amount of Mecha in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> and its adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> has been increasing over the years. In the earliest years of <em>Sentai</em>, each team simply had one mecha for the entire series. From the late 80s to the 90s, each series introduced a secondary Mecha halfway through the series, which usually served as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">Mecha Expansion Pack</a> for the primary mecha. The introduction of the secondary mecha was usually done with much fanfare. Nowadays, each series is filled with so much Mecha, that the introduction of a new Mecha or combination doesn't have the impact it used to have.
<ul><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>, it also applies to the titular heroes as well, given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> aspect. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury">certain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge">series</a>, people will sometimes remark that the Rangers they encounter are not THE Power Rangers, but merely A group of Power Rangers. In most cases, many teams are aware of other Ranger teams also active at the same time, usually during teamup episodes.

<ul><li> The Planeswalkers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> are one in a thousand in a thousand, spellcasters that can cross the expanses between planes. However, with their increased storyline focus comes an unspoken increase in their population; such that there are always enough planeswalkers on a given plane (at any given time) to round out a reasonably sized cast.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sarkhan:</strong> Planeswalker. That's what we're called. There are very few of us. But between you, me, and Ugin, there are three in this valley right now.

However, one-in-a-billion means that there would currently be between 7 and 8 beings with Sparks on this planet/Plane alone, and any one could Awaken through a traumatic event. Given that there are literally <em>hundreds</em> or <em>thousands</em> of different Planes in the Multiverse (sometimes even sub-planes within the same Plane itself, such as Alara), that means that there are statistically just as many, or more, Planeswalkers out there. This is especially exacerbated by the fact that, before the Mending, Planeswalkers were <em>all</em> immortal, and, indeed, many Planeswalkers still <em>are</em> because they're Dragons, Vampires, Demons, Elves, Golems, their souls &amp; bodies are kept magically youthful, etc., meaning that there can be several <em>dozen</em> Planeswalkers produced by any sufficiently-populated Plane over the course of a few millennia alone (as observed by both Dominaria which has had huge populations at given points in its history, and Ravnica, which still <em>does</em> have an enormous population).

<ul><li> This appears frequently, often overlapping <em>heavily</em> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">Doing In the Wizard</a> tendencies it develops near the storyline's end. Almost every detail has to have a subversive explanation behind it. As the writer described to the fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect">tease all the plot threads you want</a>, but you have to deliver the explanations sometime.
</li><li> The original six Toa were introduced as borderline-mythical, ultra-powerful warriors. <em>The</em> Toa. When the Seventh Toa appeared, it was a truly major thing that heavily affected the plot. Then came the revelation at the beginning of the Metru Nui saga: "You are not the first Toa!" A flashback during that arc to a great war showed one scene which had a total of <em>300</em> Toa appearing at once. Since then, Toa have became as "standard" as the Jedi in their respective universe, and the original six had to be re-branded as Toa Mata. <em>However</em>, the Mata are still unique in that their destiny (to awaken Mata Nui should something happen to him) is still incredibly important, and indeed, they were <em>made</em> as Toa (rather than Matoran who became Toa) before Mata Nui himself was even fully-online and were in fact the first Toa team in existence (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">though they forgot about that part thanks to how long they spent sleeping</a>).
</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Makuta</a>, nowadays known as Teridax. The most mysterious and powerful, nearly untouchable evil might, the Master of Shadows and the ultimate foe the Toa have to face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subversion">Subversion</a>: no, he's just one of the original 100 Makuta. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a>: Makuta in general and Teridax in specific is still a tough bastard to beat, and what he lost in novelty, he makes up for with his schemes. But Makuta, as a species, are nothing special now.
</li><li> Silver colored pieces. To a lesser degree, also gold. When the Toa <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">upgraded</a> into Toa Nuva, they received silver armor and weapons to reflect that they're "more" than mere Toa. The Bohrok-Kal came along, sporting silver as their secondary color to showcase their eliteness compared to regular Bohrok. After these, silver parts became a standard for absolutely every character, and colored weapons became such a rarity in fact, that when the 2009 first wave sets re-introduced element-specific colorings, there was much happiness... that lasted 'till the second wave, which went back to giving silver weapons to about half its sets. <br/>Gold went through an easier course. While beginning from 2004, many sets had it as their secondary or tertiary color, there were always figures (often special edition ones) that gave it some uniqueness. And in 2010, a former gold-wearing character had to be recolored silver just to make that year's "Golden Bionicle" promotion all the more special. But this didn't make all the other, <em>non</em>-special golden characters nonexistent.

These include Twilight Sparkle, the human counterparts of the Mane 6, Sunset Shimmer, and the Dazzlings.It's obvious why Twilight has the ability, the Humane Seven are implied to have spiritual connections to the Elements of Harmony, and the Dazzlings only gained the ability after absorbing and warping the magic of friendship. In the toyline, every doll is depicted with pony ears, and some are shown with wings (the one exception is the only boy doll, Flash Sentry). This includes characters not even based on ponies like Zecora and Queen Chrysalis.

</li><li> Many of the cast had similar powers or statistics, but often at least some unique attribute. As time passed, more characters were created to mimic another's ability with only minor differences in controlling, so as to enable more counterparts for Story Mode and multiplayer.

<ul><li> Each generation is released with new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Legendary/Mythical Pokémon</a>, which are meant to be one-of-a-kind (at least for most of them) and incredibly rare. At last count, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">there are around fifty-four of them</a>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Gen IV</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">V</a> hosting around <em>fourteen</em> each. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Gen VI</a> reduced the number of new legendaries it introduced to six (tying it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Gen II</a> for the smallest number of new legendaries), though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Gen VII</a> brings the number back up to <em>eleven</em> (though six of them are part of two evolution families).
<ul><li> This will also lead to a meta-example: Every single player knows where every legendary is, knows it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, and (ab)uses it. So it's entirely possible to have a four-player Mewtwo and Mewtwo vs. Mewtwo and Mewtwo match.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pokémon GO</a></em>'s take on Legendaries all but eliminates their legendary-ness—how many you collect is limited only by the number of "raids" you're willing to do and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">how much money you're willing to spend on raid passes</a>. Many players get entire 6-mon teams of <em>each</em> legendary, or collect far more of them just to get as many perfect-stat ones as possible and throw away the rest (the game encourages the latter, since that way you can get lots of "candy" to level up the good ones). Mythical ones, so far, are limited to one per account, but getting one only requires completing a straightforward series of tasks. Many normal non-legendary mons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonplaceRare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonplaceRare">are far more valuable than legendaries</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AugmentedReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AugmentedReality">they can only be caught in certain regions of the world</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Mewtwo, a man-made Pokémon born from cloning Mew's genetic DNA, used to be known as "the world's most powerful Pokémon", suggesting that Pokémon with such awesome powers had never been seen or known of by humans before. Legendary Pokémon of later generations are godlike in their cosmic powers and capabilities, with many humans knowing of them through myths and legends and revering them as deities, making the previous hype for a cloned Psychic-type Pokémon who would not have existed during the times when all the legends about the godlike Legendaries were made and told seem ridiculous. This especially goes for Arceus, who has the ability to <em>create life itself</em> and is, essentially, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>.
</li><li> In Gen I, Ghost types were only found on one tower and required a Slyph Scope to be able to see and capture at all. By Gen II, Ghost types were more common and the scope was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">written out entirely</a>. By Gen VII, ghost types are treated in-universe as dangerous, but are also far more mundane than they originally were.
</li><li> With the introduction of Hidden Abilities in Gen V, many Abilities formerly exclusive to a single Pokémon or evolution line have spread to other species. This hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Kyogre and Groudon</a> hard, as their once world-ending weather Abilities now seemed less imposing when a common Politoed could also summon rain instantly. Their Primal Reversions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire</a></em> avert this by having unique Abilities that are stronger than their original ones.
</li><li> The same occurs with unique type combinations and signature moves. Dragon and Ghost types used to be represented by a single family each back in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></em>. Now there's a good selection of them to choose from.
</li><li> In its earliest appearances, Eevee was often mentioned to be a very rare Pokémon and was even implied to be extinct in the wild in <em>Yellow</em>. For a long time this trait was kept by the narrative, as the only Eevee the player could receive were gifts from NPCs or found after obtaining the National Dex in areas explicitly stated to contain rare Pokémon... then Generations V and VI quashed the entire notion by introducing areas that allowed the player to catch as many wild Eevee as they want. Despite this, its Pokédex entry in <em>X</em>, due to being reused from <em>Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>, still pretends it's a rare species.
</li><li> Other Pokémon have had this happen to them over time. In the generation where they're introduced, they may be difficult to obtain, but later generations may make them easier and easier to find. For continuity-related reasons this has happened to Lapras. Throughout the series it was mentioned that Lapras had been driven to near-extinction by hunters. Starting with <em>Sun and Moon</em> this was reversed. Pokédex entries now state that Lapras <em>used</em> to be an endangered species but due to conversation efforts they're now extremely common.
</li><li> Fossils were once very rare and hard to obtain, with the player only getting a choice one per game. Around Gen IV, however, multiple fossils became very easy to obtain (though certain fossils tend to be version exclusives, and new fossils remain a "once-per-game" choice for at least their debut gen).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em>, Mega Evolution was available to the player and a select few NPCs: Korrina, the Gym Leader who introduces it to the player; Lysandre, the leader of Team Flare; Diantha, the Champion; and (post-game) the player's rival. One game later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a></em>, Mega Evolution is used by Maxie, Archie, Steven, Wally, Lisia, Zinnia, and (post-game) the Hoenn Elite Four. In the next generation, starting from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>, while Mega Evolution takes a back seat to introduce Z-Moves to the game, it is still used by many different Trainers, including minor NPCs in the Battle Tree.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> was a singular person in the earlier gens. Starting with Gen V, there were multiple. <em>X/Y</em> had four, and as recent as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Sword/Shield</a></em> there were three.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> introduced the Keyblade, a weapon that can open or close the heart of worlds, can open any lock, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">can't be stolen from the wielder</a>, and can appear from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace">Hammerspace</a>.

Then it turns out King Mickey is also a chosen one. And so is Kairi, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Roxas</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2">Xion</a> (those last two having the excuse of a connection to Sora). By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Birth by Sleep</a></em>, there are seven active Keyblade wielders plus one retired wielder and it turns out there was once a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenMany">whole slew of them</a>, <em>at once!</em> And then once <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Dream Drop Distance</a></em> rolls around, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lea gets a Keyblade as well</span>, even though unlike the other characters, he already had a weapon and could fight perfectly fine without needing one; this brings the total number of active wielders to 8 counting the <em>BBS</em> trio. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, it's explained that Keyblade wielders became a whole lot more unique because of a little something called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">the Keyblade War</a>, which <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering">broke the universe</a></em> and led the few wielders that remained swearing to protect the worlds to keep it from happening again, as well as <em>carefully</em> training successors to not restart the Keyblade War</span>.
</li><li> For the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">first</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">two</a> games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a></em>, Phazon is a rare and mysterious substance, and the space pirates go to great lengths to secure sources of it; but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em>, Phazon is everywhere. It's reasonably justified in many cases in that Phazon has been weaponized and thus heavily adopted by both the Space Pirates and the Galactic Federation as part of the interstellar arms race, and that Phazon is found in the environments because the Pirates are deliberately trying to spread it everywhere and it's pretty good at spreading itself anyway. However, it stretches disbelief a bit that every other random indigenous alien space monster now runs on Phazon (according to the scan data), when they've only been exposed to it for a few weeks. Especially considering that exposure to Phazon was established in Prime to usually be rather immediately deadly, with dozens of Space Pirate test subjects dying or going irredeemably psychotic due to trial exposure, with the Omega Pirate being the <em>one</em> that didn't, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">notoriously hardy Metroids</a> being about the only species that could reliably survive even passing exposure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> has a few examples of this.
<ul><li> The night elves of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>. In their introduction in <em>Warcraft III</em> they were ancient, immortal protectors of the world that had existed for 16,000 years at the bare minimum. Almost everything that defined their backstory, such as their immortality, how long they've been around, the betrayal of their leaders to the Legion, and the loss of their homeland, all would be matched or one-upped by the Draenei in Burning Crusade. As of <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>, it's easier to list the races that <em>aren't</em> at least as old as the night elves, with even the formerly-described "young race" of the humans revealed to have existed for 15,000 years (albeit not as immortals), and the draenei have for a whopping <em>twenty-five thousand.</em> The elves were also close allies of the dragons, but since <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> the dragons have been popping up helping people everywhere.
</li><li> The fact that night elves had glowing eyes were originally part of their magical, ancient and mysterious nature. Now a good third of the playable races have glowing eyes, and certain classes allow <em>all</em> races to have them. Despite this, Paladins, which have had them since their introduction in <em>Warcraft II</em>, a full game before Night Elves, do not have any.
</li><li> When lore was first set down for the dragons, it was shown that all dragons belong to one of five "Flights": Red, Green, Blue, Bronze, and Black. <em>World of Warcraft</em> had the black dragons experimenting with creating a new, Chromatic flight, with powers of all flights. Even that idea proliferated quickly, with there being some sort of new dragons connected to the black dragons every time we met them, from Nether dragons to Twilight dragons. Then we met the proto-dragons, which were revealed to be the form of the dragons before they were empowered by the Titans, and ever since new kinds of dragons pop up all the time.
</li><li> The Blue Dragon Aspect, Malygos, was said to have gone insane when his dragonflight was destroyed by Deathwing's betrayal during the War of the Ancients. This didn't prevent blue dragons from increasingly appearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, building up until Malygos formed an army to wage war on mortals as part of the insanity supposedly brought on by losing all of his kind.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> has this with regards to Spartans: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em> declared that Master Chief was the last surviving Spartan-II <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a>. This was quickly retconned, as other Spartan-IIs were later revealed to have been alive at the same in-universe time of the first game. Still, their number had greatly diminished, and there were only 33 of them to begin with, so the uniqueness still applied somewhat. Then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGhostsOfOnyx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGhostsOfOnyx">Halo: Ghosts of Onyx</a></em> revealed that there was a separate Spartan-<strong>III</strong> program which trained hundreds of disposable suicide soldiers. After that, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em> introduced a new class of Spartan-<strong>IVs</strong> produced after the Human-Covenant War ends that are a lot easier to train than the previous Spartan programs, greatly increasing the number of Spartans in the universe. To be fair, though, those programs represent decades of development and refining. Spartan-IIs had to be chosen based on specific genetic parameters, and the original list of 150 was eventually cut in half for budget reasons. The enhancement procedure further reduced that number by half, with many not surviving or being permanently crippled by it. By the time the Spartan-III program rolled around, significant strides have been made in adapting the procedure for a larger sample of the population, to the point where hundreds of Spartan-IIIs could be trained and enhanced without the need for a complex genetic selection process; also, all enhancements were successful this time around. The Spartan-IV project revives the original idea from the failed Spartan-I project (AKA Project ORION), which involved enhancing veteran soldiers using the tech and lessons learned from II and III. All surviving Spartan-IIs and IIIs are "upgraded" to Spartan-IV standards alongside volunteers from among the UNSC Marines and ODSTs. Also, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">MJOLNIR armor</a> is initially described as incredibly expensive, but this is because it consists of cutting-edge technology that is partly reverse-engineered from Covenant tech. This is also why Spartan-IIIs are initially only provided the significantly weaker (and cheaper) SPI armor. It's only after production is streamlined that MJOLNIR costs go down, allowing every Spartan to be equipped with his or her own slightly-modified MJOLNIR.

Due to <em>Morrowind</em>'s extremely limited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a> (unique for the series), the game world is largely static with items hand-placed outside of containers never changing, meaning that a level one character can find the same loot as a much higher level character (often turning into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a> situation and averting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfWeaponEffectiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfWeaponEffectiveness">Sorting Algorithm of Weapon Effectiveness</a>). This means that finding equipment made from these canonically rare materials is a real accomplishment. The only NPCs who possess this equipment are either high ranking nobles and knights or very strong bandit leaders. However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, the level-scaling system significantly changes the loot distribution mechanic along with changes to the level-scaling system in general. These games rely on a strictly level-based loot system, with the player finding increasingly more powerful equipment as they level up, resulting in a high level character finding supposedly rare equipment in almost every treasure chest and blacksmith's inventory. Another side effect of this is that almost every bandit and their dog also wields strong equipment, severely downplaying the fact your character possesses equipment made from rare materials.

By disc three, there's an entire mountain filled with nothing but dragons. Yet somehow, they're still treated as insanely rare.
</li><li> The same applies to winglies. The reveal that Lenus and Lloyd are winglies is treated as a huge shock to most of the cast. Then over the course of the game, two entire villages of winglies are introduced (though one doesn't know about the other). In the end, Lenus and Lloyd are only unusual in the fact they don't hail from either village.

Not only did these Rayman lookalikes disappear as the series went on, but <em>Origins</em> changed the species of some characters (such as the Magician, who looked like part of Rayman's species, being changed to a Teensie) and it now seems like Rayman really is one-of-a-kind aside from clones.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Lightningbending</a>, which was emphasized as being dangerous and masterable by only a select few (all the ones in the original series were members of the royal family), has become common enough that people who need second jobs can do it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">run a power plant</a> (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that lightningbenders are still relatively rare).
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraOreDinary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraOreDinary">metalbending</a> (previously exclusive to the original series's Toph) is a standard skill taught to Republic City's police force, Zaofu's city guard, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Earth Empire's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a></span> (though this is <em>not</em> an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift">Continuity Drift</a>, since Toph founded the first metalbending school <em>and</em> Republic City's police, her younger daughter founded Zaofu, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a former Zaofu guard</span> founded <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Earth Empire</span>).
</li><li> In the original show, one vengeful waterbender enslaved by the Fire Nation had discovered bloodbending, and she taught it only to Katara, who finds it so abhorrent that she uses it on <em>extremely</em> rare occasion and would definitely never teach it to anyone else (in fact, she eventually gets it outlawed). The control it requires is such that even for a master waterbender, it was thought to be possible only under a full moon, when a waterbender's power is at its peak. In <em>The Legend of Korra,</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tarrlok</span>, his brother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Amon</span>, and their father Yakone are all revealed to be bloodbenders, each powerful enough to immobilize a full room of people <em>without</em> a full moon. Sokka even lampshades this in a flashback to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yakone's trial</span>, noting that even during his youth, people were developing bending in ways previously thought impossible.
</li><li> Permanently removing a person's bending abilities, introduced in the final episode of the first series as an ancient ability that had been lost to time, was a technique thought possible only by the Avatar in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">the Avatar State</a>, at great risk to himself. Amon, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the first season, is able to debend others with little apparent effort, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> although the means that he does so are revealed to be completely different from Aang's, and his method can also be undone by an Avatar</span>.
</li><li> Though it's unknown whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParalyzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParalyzer">chi</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">blocking</a> was completely unique to Ty Lee, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagicalFaction">Equalists</a> use her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePoint">Pressure Point</a>-based techniques to fight against benders, though in her case it's mentioned that she did teach it to some others.
</li><li> Combustion Man's explosion-based combustionbending (a variant of firebending) is still quite rare in <em>Korra</em>'s time, allowing P'Li to remain a serious threat in Book 3, but the particulars of how it is performed are now well-known, as are its weaknesses.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, Airbending was almost completely wiped out, with one sole survivor. Come the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a>, there were four, all descendants of the last survivor. Korra manages to get some by the first season finale, but all airbenders we see aside from this small group of people are from the past. Then season 3 comes around, and now hundreds of airbenders are running around thanks to Harmonic Convergence.

While they had the title of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessesRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessesRule">Princess</a>", the show treated them more as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">divine royality</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Goddesses</a>.

By the end of season 3, Twilight Sparkle, the main protagonist, was also made into an alicorn. Season 4 finale firmly etablishes that there are only four known alicorns in Equestria. In season 6, Princess Cadance and Shining Armor have a baby named Princess Flurry Heart, who is <em>also</em> an alicorn princess, bringing the total to 5. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">the toy line has three more who don't appear in the show and one of the magazines depicts another</a> (Princess Gold Lily, Princess Sterling, Princess Skyla, and Leon).

After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the capability of nuclear weaponry became realized, more and more nations scrambled to get their own nukes ready. Now, there are five nations that openly are accepted to have nuclear weapons<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8f315');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8f315" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8f315');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom and Russia</span>, three nations that not-so-secretly have them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9la3e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9la3e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9la3e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Israel, Pakistan and India</span>, two more that are making strides to get them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1089hl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1089hl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1089hl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Iran and North Korea</span> and one that might have been attempting to start a weapons program in the recent past<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11knto');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11knto" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11knto');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Syria</span>. And all <em>that's</em> not even getting into the dozens of nations that theoretically could get them at any time if they were willing to put up with the international pressure that would be put on them and the various nations that did have nuclear weapons or a weapons program at some point in the past. Combine that with the constantly decreasing difficulty of building more powerful missiles means that more than a few could have weapons capable of vaporizing cities and those weapons could be fired at targets thousands of kilometers away. Unsurprisingly this means that a lot of nations get very uneasy whenever two or more nuclear-armed nations get into a standoff.
</li><li> Really this applies to nearly any technology that people want. Computers, weapons, cars, cell phones... as the cost of making something decreases and the knowledge of the makers increase every technology eventually will lose its rare availability.
<ul><li> This applies to knowledge as well. Literacy was a rarity until recently, and the fact that you're probably not reading this text aloud makes you more literate than anyone a thousand years ago. Know how to do long division? You'd be a wizard in 15th-Century Europe, since Arabic numerals hadn't been introduced yet and division was practically impossible with Roman numerals. You might even know enough about relativity to prove Newton wrong, even though it was barely in universities one hundred years ago. The invention of the internet has made an absolutely enormous amount of information on almost any subject readily available to the average person, which has sped up cultural change.
</li><li> This also applies to skills. Being able to do something makes you stand out among those who cannot do that skill. However, your uniqueness quickly diminishes when you meet people whose skill level is equal or higher than yours. This is most apparent when it comes to sports. You may be able to perform a crossover dribble or throw a football for 15 yards because it's your hobby or you learned it by imitating what you saw on TV/the Internet. However, when playing against actual athletes or simply just watching them perform multiple crossover moves or launch footballs from one end of the field to the other, then it becomes clear that your skill is clearly not that unique.
</li><li> This is played with when it comes to Languages. Being able to understand and communicate using a foreign language looks impressive if most of your peers cannot do the same thing. Then you go to an environment like a school or a club where most people like you can do the same thing, with some being better than you at it, and your skill becomes mundane in comparison. However, if you go to a country where that language is natively spoken, your uniqueness comes from being a non-native who has a functional level of communication and it's more impressive if you have a native-speaker level of fluency.
</li></ul></li><li> The color <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsPowerful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsPowerful">purple</a>. Once used as a color for royalty, now a color for just about everyone thanks to cheaper synthetic dyes. In fact, have you ever noticed almost no flags have purple? It's because trying to get enough dye to put purple on your flags would've been horrifically expensive for any country up until ~200 years ago. Blue also used to be rare.
</li><li> Aluminum used to be worth more than gold. Refining its ores used to be very difficult, making pure aluminum very rare. The Hall-Héroult process made obtaining pure aluminum much easier and its high price subsequently collapsed.
</li><li> When <em>being a person who enjoys a certain thing</em> stops being rare, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks">It's Popular, Now It Sucks!</a> is born.
</li><li> A story that is often told regarding the strength of the human spirit; before Roger Bannister broke the 4-minute mile, it was believed to be so impossible anybody who attempted would die in the process. After he proved it was possible, within a short time, high-school kids were doing it.
</li><li> The United States and France were unique as republics in the 18th Century, but now <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy#Current_examples">most<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> kingdoms left are constitutional monarchies with the king or queen as a figurehead, and even they're comparatively rare. France's form of nationalism, where membership of a country was based on a shared cultural identity rather obeying a king, was also unique for the time, but now every country (monarchies included) has some form of national identity separate from its rulers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Zoroastrianism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> was the first monotheistic faith; now, a majority of the world believe in a single god, while Zoroastrianism itself isn't even in the top five forms of monotheism.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12ka41');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12ka41" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12ka41');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which are (in order) Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Judaism and the Bahá'i Faith. Hinduism does have monotheistic groups, and they might be big enough to make the list too. Poor Ahura Mazda...</span>
</li><li> It used to be very rare for a human to be over 6' tall, over 200 lbs, or particularly strong. In first world countries, at least, decades of vastly improved nutrition and medical care compared to centuries prior have made it a lot less rare to grow taller than six feet and weigh over 200 lbs (whether that's largely muscle or just being fat varies by the individual). The six foot, two to three inch tall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>, weighing in at MAYBE 200 lbs, rounding up, was considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">a remarkably large man</a> back in the 1700s. In a crowd of 21st century Americans, he'd be a bit taller than most, and definitely no heavier than the average.
</li><li> Any animal species that was once rare but makes a comeback from near extinction, but this is a unanimously good example of this trope.
<ul><li> Examples include the bald eagle. Its population went down in the mid-20th century for a number of factors, including being hunted because of the false assumption that it posed an significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend">threat to livestock and young children</a>, and an at the time widely used pesticide that had the effect of thinning its eggshells or making it sterile. The pesticide was eventually banned, as well as hunting the bird. Its population recovered.
</li><li> More controversially, large predators like wolves and great white sharks were once hunted to near extinction in their natural ranges due to their preceived threat to humans (and livestock in the case of the wolves). Conservation laws introduced near the end of the 20th century have allowed those predators to return in some numbers, but the bias still remains and some regions will still call for hunts over particulary notable incidents.
