Stalker type behavior in a man can make him a romantic hero but the same behavior will almost always make a woman dangerous or pathetic. Interestingly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> trope features an exactly opposite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>.
</p><p>Some more forgiving depictions of this trope rely on the stalker simply being too shy to approach the object of his or her affections directly, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">is otherwise harmless</a>.

While Yuno certainly believes firmly in this trope to the point where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she actually traveled to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">parallel space-time universe</a> <em>just</em> to be with him again</span>, Yuki is... less than convinced. He falls in love with her by the end, if only because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">he's just as messed-up as her.</a></span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>, although Tsuna is sort of creeped out by Gokudera's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> tendencies, the show depicts him as being a very loyal and wonderful friend, writing off his desire to kill off anyone who gets close to Tsuna as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">comedy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sōsuke is assigned a mission in which he must follow Kaname around and protect her from terrorists, all the while not letting her know. Although his actions are <em>way</em> overboard by any normal standards and could easily be constructed as stalking, Kaname seems to view it with a mixture of curiosity, annoyance, attraction, and a bit of amusement. The reasons are probably a mix of the factors that Sōsuke's actions are <em>extremely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">outlandish even by stalking standards</a>, he appears to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">as much grasp of romance and sexuality as her hamster</a>, and of course that he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">extremely attractive</a>. This disappears when she finds Sōsuke on her balcony <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">with a pair of her panties in his hand</a> (which, in fact, were snatched back from Shinji, who was the one trying to steal it because some bullies put him up to it), at which point she attempts to beat him to death with a baseball bat and completely refuses to trust or talk to him until he explains the truth behind his actions. Once Kaname is in on the whole secret and can relate to Sōsuke better through an understanding of his background, it's the beginning of a friendship that develops into love.
</li><li> Leonard, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">Pretty Boy</a> antagonist, seems to believe this trope justifies his pushy advances towards Kaname, but this is treated very differently from how Sōsuke acted. Sōsuke never had any ulterior motives besides protecting Kaname to begin with, and he spent a long time learning from Kaname how to behave properly in society and respect her feelings. That she started to fall in love with Sōsuke — and he with her — is because they truly value each other as people, whereas Leonard acts like he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou">entitled to have her</a> as his conquest just because he's ostensibly more suave. He only succeeds in getting Kaname to hate his guts, especially since he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredFirstKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredFirstKiss">stole her first kiss</a>, which she wished she had given to Sōsuke</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonaGura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TonaGura">Tona-Gura!</a></em>: Yuuji Kagura towards Kazuki Arisaka. His efforts are clumsy, and easily turned away, and he does not insist on being and knowing her entire existence. Despite being mostly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a>. Repeated beatings at her hands and the bullets of his little sister's guns do not seem capable of dissuading him from grabbing at her and raising her skirt, or trying to bear-hug her in a state of undress.
</li><li> Played with the usual amount of taste and seriousness (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">that is, none at all</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>, where Matoi and Kafuka certainly believe this. Of course, Nozomu kindly informs her that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossingTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossingTheLineTwice">mutual suicide</a></em> is true love. And then unfortunately informs her that he'd be happy to kill himself with her at any time, so she took up stalking him while her previous stalking victim started stalking <em>her.</em>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">It's not 'stalking', it's 'Deep Love'!</a>
</li><li> Which actually leads to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjnklo7QryU">a chain of stalking<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>
</li><li> Despite many of the girls in the class believing this, they are off-put by an expression by a (clearly perverted and weird) Buddhist Monk of this philosophy in one episode. The episode deals with different things in life being "previews" for later things, and the Monk claims that standing outside of your beloved's home is a preview for a date. His audience protests that this is just stalking.
</li><li> Arguably, the series (if only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>) shows the philosophy validated. After a while, Itoshki seems completely used to Matoi following him everywhere, even into the bathroom, and is quite comfortable in one episode with her living in his home, and is also comfortable with Kiri Komori living in his closet, and she also followed him into the bathroom at least once.
<ul><li> Then again, it's pretty clear that none of these people, Nozomu included, could be considered even remotely well-adjusted.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AskDrRin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AskDrRin">Ask Dr. Rin!</a></em>, this is Meirin, full stop. Maybe justified by the fact that she and Asuka are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriousChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriousChildhoodFriend">childhood friends</a>, but that angle just makes it look even more awkward.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Zetsuai1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Zetsuai1989">Zetsuai1989</a></em> is about a male singer named Kouji who's childhood crush on a male soccer star named Izumi that he fell for as a kid, leads to assorted sexual harassment when the two meet in person years later. The series romanticizes stalking and rewards the attacker in the end when the victim becomes comfortable with his stalker and stops running away.
</li><li> Spoofed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> when Anri (jokingly) implies that she's been stalking Mikado. Upon hearing this, Mikado's brain starts zig-zagging the hell out of this trope (complete with Mikado's Inner Puppet Theater) like only a hormonal teenager can before Anri finally tells him she was kidding
<div class="indent"><strong>Mikado:</strong> Oh, crap! Is she a stalker? Wait. If she's cute it's okay, rig<em>No</em>, this is <em>bad</em>. It might go like... She might stab me! Or set my house on fire! And what if she takes my parents hostage?... But, maybe she has a nice personality. Then it would be okay, right?... Wait. If she did, <em>she wouldn't be stalking me!</em>
</div></li><li> Shuichi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation">Gravitation</a></em> chases Yuki constantly, despite being rejected, verbally abused, and often being called a little brat. They eventually end up together.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KoharuNoHibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KoharuNoHibi">Koharu No Hibi</a></em> while Akira <em>is</em> freaked out by Koharu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> tendencies he still eventually ends up dating her because as he said he can't leave her alone.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>, Mizore constantly stalks the main character by hiding in a dozen various places and spying on him because she has a crush on him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveTheInfluence">Too bad he never notices</a>.
</li><li> Arima's dark side in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano">Kare Kano</a></em>. Any time that he comes onto the screen, you just know Arima is seconds away from shattering. This is made worse because to the outside world, he appears to be a put together, genius with his only match being Yukino, his girlfriend. It's scary to slowly see his thoughts morph from wanting to be with Yukino, to wanting to isolate her from everyone and keep her just for himself. His fighting with these thoughts proves that Arima is a good guy, but him imagining tying Yukino in chains does not bode well for their relationship. This is a rare case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> in which not only is the stalker in a committed relationship with his crush, but he is also portrayed as so sympathetic that you just want to save him from himself.
</li><li> Played all over the place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>. Mikoto is being stalked by the grandson of her school's dean. While he's pretty attractive, she still finds him creepy and she can't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">zap him</a> because of his status, so she enlists Toma to pretend to be her boyfriend long enough to throw him off. This doesn't work—because he's actually a spy sent to keep an eye on Toma's growing list of powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>, specifically Mikoto. Except that he really is in love with her, and volunteered for the mission so that they wouldn't send someone else, who wouldn't have a problem killing her if she got difficult (and "difficult" is a pretty good way of summarizing Mikoto).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, this trope gets combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a> with regards to the Uzumaki family.

While Torso's actions towards his "lovers" are depicted as being very disturbing, Torso thinks what he's doing isn't wrong. Sasaki theorizes that Torso removes the legs of his victims so they won't "leave". Once he becomes obsessed with Mutsuki, he becomes obsessed with following him and making him his, which especially escalates after Mutsuki responds to his affections in the negative leading to him to cut off his limbs to keep him from leaving. A volume 4 diary entry reveals that he believes they share a mysterious connection, and this "spark" of desire will be his salvation. He just believes they need to have a long, private talk.....then Mutsuki will understand their destined bond, and return his love. After he cuts off Mutsuki's legs and arms he declares he will forcibly marry him while having him dressed up in a white dress and putting a wedding ring on his cut-off hand. He then stands in front of him shirtless while breathing deeply which heavily implies Attempted Rape. Usually, his past "lovers" rejection of him drives him to extreme violence to punish them including destroying their faces. Also, in chapter 73 of re: Torso brings Mutsuki a flower crown, but gets angry when Mutsuki glares at him and won't accept his compliments. He beats Mutsuki violently while screaming insults. He later has them on a makeshift bed and says he only beats Mutsuki because of how deep his love for him is. He also gets a sad backstory and Mutsuki finds himself sympathizing with Torso after hearing it despite how he abused him.

He shows up at both of her workplaces (she's a realtor who teaches ESL part-time) uninvited and unannounced and otherwise manipulates situations in order to bring her close to him, essentially forcing her into a relationship. At one point, incensed at his conduct, she shows up at <em>his</em> office to tell him off, and here the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> kicks in full force — whereas his behavior was portrayed as adorable and playful even though she clearly found it upsetting, hers is made out to be alarming and disruptive even though she has every right to be angry with him.

And then he waits in the darkness outside her dressing room so he can sneak inside and search for The Phantom. Christine does call him on this creepy behaviour and Raoul does eventually cool down by the end of the book.

<ul><li> In the same book, Grey also stalks Ana Steele across state lines when she goes to visit her mother in Savannah, Georgia. Ana calls it stalking, too; she's just unable to grasp that stalking is a <em>bad</em> thing.

One night when two of the girls are sitting together, they're frightened by mysterious phone calls and noises outside. When one of the girls actually sees someone running away from the house at one point, she gets fed up and calls the police, who bring in one of her classmates. When she and the cops demand to know why he's been harassing her, he shyly admits that he was trying to work up the nerve to ask her out—and she <em>accepts</em>.

It is simultaneously denied: other characters, especially Buffy's male friends, think that his behavior is creepy and dangerous.

<ul><li> In self-aware moments, Angel himself seems to understand that this behavior is unhealthy. He seems aware that stalking is not good, but it is better than what he was doing before.

When the detectives interview the business partner of a man they suspect of raping and murdering an assistant DA, she mentions that the man had sent her flowers the day after they met, presumably to entice her into going into business with him. Rather than seeing it as a sweet gesture, she admits that the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVillainKnowsWhereYouLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVillainKnowsWhereYouLive">he knew her address</a> scared the hell out of her.

But after she learns Ryan had nothing to do with her rape and killed the guy who did attack her, her opinion of him starts to change. So it <em>works</em> (eventually), and she ends up falling in love with him. Though the show lampshades this as not being a very healthy relationship.
</li><li> Mark from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeepShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeepShow">Peep Show</a></em> goes to great lengths to win Sophie's heart during the first two seasons of the show.

Despite the comedy setting, it's made clear that his behavior is wrong—his father yells at him about it, Denise herself repeatedly tells him to leave her alone, and another girlfriend dumps him because he can't get over her.

Throughout all this, she repeatedly and explicitly tells him to leave her alone and during the kissing scene, repeatedly pushes him away and tells him "Fuck you" (in other words, <em><strong>"No"</strong></em>), before finally responding to his kisses. The next shot is of them in bed. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> is glaring—throughout their on-again, off-again relationship, any pursuing behavior of Carrie's was viewed as pitiful and worthy of ridicule and ended with her being dumped, whereas Big's harassment and essentially forcing himself on her is portrayed as sexy and romantic and results in him getting her back.
<ul><li> To a lesser extent with Steve and Miranda. From the moment their one-night stand is over, she makes it clear that this is all she wants. He responds by constantly calling her, showing up at her placeat one point, threatening to make a scene if she doesn't let him inand overall, repeatedly ignoring her numerous requests that he leave her alone. This is never made out to be bad, despite Miranda's obvious annoyance with his persistence, just a case of the "Wild" guy trying to win over the "Uptight" woman and get her to let her defenses down.

In the last verse, she sends him a letter, saying that she's been arrested and sent to prison for going through his mail, and he's <em>flattered</em> that she says she'll keep tabs on him. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, though, and isn't <em>half</em> as creepy as some of the other examples on this list.

</li><li> Gavin DeBecker's book <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGiftOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGiftOfFear">The Gift of Fear</a></em> discusses this trope at length, with many examples of how the media not only often portrays stalking in a romantic or humourous light, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> that usually comes with it—when a man acts like this, it's romantic and he gets the girl he's been chasing. When a woman does, it's pathetic at best and dangerous at worst and she is always appropriately punished, whether it be being dumped, humiliated, or even killed.

Typically the affected person believes that a secret admirer, usually a stranger, high-status individual, or celebrity, is sending secret signals of affection through significant glances or telepathy. The patient then returns this perceived affection with a flood of gifts and notes, believing that any denial of the relationship is a ploy to conceal their forbidden love from the rest of the world.
