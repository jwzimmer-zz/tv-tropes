<dl><dd><div class="indent"> <strong>Double H</strong>: Ouch! "Respect the home team", Chapter 12!
</div></dd></dl></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> Stealing from the store in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a></em> causes everyone to call you THIEF. (You also get a hilarious message from the game: "Guess what? You got it for free. ...Are you proud of yourself?") Oh, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShopliftAndDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShopliftAndDie">shopkeeper kills you when you enter the store again.</a>
</li><li> More from <em>Link's Awakening</em>: when Marin is following you around, she'll comment on certain actions. She calls you a bad boy for breaking pots and feels sorry for chickens when you slash them. On the other hand, she <em>loves</em> it when you dig with the shovel. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">And try slashing a chicken over and over</a>  occasionally she approves!)
</li><li> Lastly from <em>Link's Awakening</em>: there is a mermaid who lost her necklace in the game. Well, at least in the American English version and a few European localizations (the English one for example), that is. In the Japanese version and in most European localizations, she lost her bra. Even worse, young Link can be a little sneaky with his underwater diving and decide to <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/icuCGX70O58?t=20s">sneak a peek at the unsuspecting mermaid<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which, in return, results in her calling you a pervert and swimming to a different spot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">Wind Waker</a></em> has a store owner who will fine you for breaking his pots. And if you attack your sensei, he gets annoyed, and eventually knocks you across the room.
<ul><li> And then there's the woman on Outset Island, who's constantly carrying around a pot on her head. If you smash it with your hookshot, or arrows (light arrows are especially fun to use when doing this), and then go and speak to her, she'll fine you.
</li></ul></li><li> Word to the wise: do <em>not</em> attack the chickens in most Zelda games. They <em>will</em> kill you. Or pigs or goats (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">Wind Waker</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>), for that matter. This dates back from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend of Zelda I</a></em>: attacking the old men who dispense random Engrish tips will cause the fires flanking them to start shooting harmful energy bubbles at you like the statues in dungeons.
<ul><li> This is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>, as the Cucco will multiply like crazy, swarming the entire level until everyone is practically drowning in them and they will not stop until you defeat the powerful Golden Cucco that eventually appears. A number of levels also start off with a Cucco following you around, meaning that it's almost inevitable you'll hit it enough to piss it off sooner or later. Certain missions spawn a mother Cucco and a baby Cucco, which is in trouble and must be rescued. If this sidequest isn't taken care of immediately, the baby Cucco will most likely be killed, which will anger the mother, and you'll be swimming in angry chickens.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em> you can use the fishing pole to snag the fisherman's hat. He yells at you, and if you lose it he makes you pay 50 rupees for it.
<ul><li> Also in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, there's a lady in Kakariko Village who needs help with finding her Cuccos. After finding all six of them, if you throw even one Cucco out of the pen, the lady will scold you for it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Twilight Princess</em>, the fishing hole girl will get mad at you if you go around rolling into things in her hut. If you do it enough times, she'll kick you out of the building, and the next time you go back in, she'll make you apologize.
</li><li> And the shop <em>bird</em> who you can steal from (fill a bottle with health potion/lantern oil and walk out without putting any rupees in the moneybox). He calls you a thief and attacks you if you try to return (though you can quiet him by putting money in). Also if you put less than 10 rupees in, he remarks "That's a little on the skimpy side..." and as you leave, says to "pay like you're supposed to next time, cheapskate."
<ul><li> Though this situation can actually be avoided, and the trope subverted, if you visit after leaving a dungeon with Ooccoo. You're free to visit the store and fill up your lantern and bottles and then use Ooccoo Jr. to teleport back. The bird won't even question it when you come back later.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieChairDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieChairDie">Destroying pumpkins</a> in Ordon village prompts one townsperson to scold you "Hey! Don't waste food!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a></em>, if you attack Zelda with any of your weapons, she'll protest. Each weapon elicits a different response, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">some of which are hilarious.</a>
<ul><li> Do it too many times and she'll tell you that you're making her angry and ask why you're being so pushy. Keep provoking her and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">she'll hit you back</a>.

After obtaining it from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the fortune-teller in Papuchia Village</span>, you deliver it to him. He's <em>really</em> happy, giving you a Force Gem out of gratitude. But if you succumb to temptation and break the vessel, he'll yell at you and demand that you replace it. (The replacement vessel costs twice as much as the first one. By this point in the game, either amount is small potatoes, but you still deserve it!)

<ul><li> Opening random cupboards gives the message "You really shouldn't open other people's cupboards without permission," though the game doesn't mind if you open your own cupboard, which contains a mysteriously self-replenishing 5 Rupees. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But this also gets subverted; opening Zelda's cupboard without permission earns you a Piece of Heart, and no reprimanding message.</span>

<ul><li> One word: <em>Magda</em>. This NPC can be found close to one of the shrines in the game, which is surrounded by a ring of flowers.

Additionally, nearly every character and animal will react differently to the various brush powers.
<ul><li> In particular, using offensive techniques like Power Slash or Inferno will make them angry and confused; using Bloom, on the other hand, will infuse them with joy and usually cause them to lovingly pat Ammy on the head.

</li><li> In the Shangri-La sequence, if you solve one of the Buddha statue puzzles before getting any clues for it, Arthur will splutter for a few moments, then ask if you've been reading the strategy guide.

They'd stay pissed off at you until you either apologised or went to the control room and fiddled with their settings.
</li><li> In an old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> text game, if you started swearing, the whole crew would react very strongly.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork">Zork</a></em> franchise is full of these:

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PeasantsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PeasantsQuest">Peasant's Quest</a></em>, the game states that "yours is a black, black heart" if you put the baby in the well.

For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessTomatoInTheSaladKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessTomatoInTheSaladKingdom">Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</a>,</em> your commands are relayed through a boy assistant who whines a lot, particularly if your commands are impossible, dangerous, immoral, or just plain nonsense.
</li><li> The early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a></em> games would respond to swearing with, "Would your mother like to hear you say that?" Odd, given the amount of commands it <em>didn't</em> seem to recognize.
</li><li> In the VGA remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestITheSarienEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestITheSarienEncounter">Space Quest</a></em>, there's one scene where you can stick your hand into a pool of corrosive acid.

When this is done in one area of the first planet, the snarky narrator responds thusly: "You lick a thick smear of filth off the street. Finding the taste unpleasant, you quickly swallow it. What a <em>smart</em> person you are!"
<ul><li> Using the tongue icon on the player's butt warrants the response "I'll bet you wish you could."
<ul><li> Both the "smell" and the "taste" cursors are <em>entirely</em> useless in that they cannot be used to help progress at any point in the game. It can be surmised that they were added solely to allow lots and lots of these gags  using them on just about every hotspot in the entire game will get a staggering number of unique, blisteringly sarcastic comments from the narrator. Talking to inanimate objects will also, at least once, elicit a reply!
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> If you tried to use a weapon on yourself in one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em> games, you'd get the response "You always hurt the ones you love." Sometimes the game would give you a dissuading response if you tried to use the hand or sword on an NPC, and sometimes you would have no warning and the NPC would just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">kill you</a>.
<ul><li> In the second game in the series, you get to nurture a magical tree back to flowering. If you throw a dagger or fireball at her, it rebounds and cracks your monitor.
</li><li> In the fourth game, as a Thief, if you kill the old man while robbing his house, you get an instant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">Have a Nice Death</a> screen for being an asshole. (The old man is also critical to advancing the plot.)
</li><li> In the fan made parody game <em>Quest For Glory 4 1/2</em>, if you clicked the hand icon on yourself, instead of the usual "You straighten out your jacket and retie your boots" description, you'd get a response that said (paraphrased) "We're not going to give you some bullshit about tying your shoes, we know what you were doing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">You were trying to masturbate, weren't you, you pervert?</a> Do you honestly think you're going to just whip it out right here?"

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PoliceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PoliceQuest">Police Quest</a> 4</em>, trying to use your gun on an innocent or unarmed civilian will get you a scolding and warning from the narrator to put the gun away. Insist once or twice more (depending on the person), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">and the game ends in failure</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Curses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Curses">Curses</a></em>, swearing causes your movement to be temporarily restricted.

Considering that the deceased is a 16-year old girl, his reaction is reasonably justified.
</li><li> In case players of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCouncil">The Council</a></em> had any doubts as to the morality of letting Peru smack around a mentally ill woman, a message informing them that they now have the "Immoral" trait (+1 to Louis' Conviction skill) will promptly pop up.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekEliteForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekEliteForce">Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force</a></em> had fellow Starfleet officers complain if you shot them  with the exception that picking up weapons in the armory and then using them to attack people when there was no mission going on was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a> instead.
<ul><li> They did a little bit more than complain in the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Virtual Voyager</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>. Strolling into the Mess Hall and drilling Neelix in the forehead with a <em>photon torpedo</em> resulted in every single crewmember in the area whipping out uber-powered phasers and swiftly reducing you to a cinder. Alternatively, a cutscene occurred where you were beamed into the brig and a random character would show up and essentially ask, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>"
<ul><li> That's nothing. If you work for it, you can break into the ship's computer core, hack your way to a higher security clearance than the <em>Captain's</em>, then watch the bridge crew freak out when you arm the Self-Destruct Sequence.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever">No One Lives Forever</a></em> on PC had a few of these. In the first mission, you could be failed for "unacceptable simian casualties" for shooting a monkey and for "defiling (character)'s corpse" if you shot a recently killed ally (of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in one case, it's used to cover up the fact that the ally's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a></span>).
</li><li> Likewise, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> sidekick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SiN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SiN">Sin Episodes</a></em> will call you out for staring at her butt, which shouldn't be too hard to find on one's own, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">her outfit seems designed to call attention to it</a>.
</li><li> Kill enough friendly Bobs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em>, and you'll get comments like "Traitorous pig!", "Whose side are you on?", "He killed Bob!", or "Look out! He's nuts!" (Starting in <em>2</em>, they have guns and are not afraid to shoot you...)
<ul><li> And then you discover that the devs most likely did it first, if some of the hidden map text is any indication. Bungie left a few bon mots in some maps  they appear as walls in inaccessible areas which can only be viewed by a map editor...
<div class="indent"> <strong>Map Text</strong>: Q: How do you tell a good BOB from a bad BOB? A: Good BOB?
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> inverts this by having the player character yell at the AI for getting in the way of his bullets.
</li><li> Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> allows for friendly fire to discourage you from just firing in all directions, you'll get plenty of automatic reactions from your teammate's character, from Bill's "Goddammit! Hold your fire!" to Louis's more amusing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis">DO - I - LOOK LIKE - ONE OF THEM?!</a>" And it should also be noted that while "thank you" in the game is automatic, "sorry" isn't.
<ul><li> Zoey's reaction to Bill's friendly fire is just plain hilarious. "<strong>DAMN</strong> IT, BILL!"
<ul><li> What about Francis? "Nice shot, Bill, THAT WAS MY ASS!"
</li><li> Based on the preview videos for the sequel, now it seems that when someone complains of friendly fire, another character will reply to it, such as "Don't get in the way next time!"
</li><li> And the sequel gives us the following friendly fire reactions:
<div class="indent"><strong>Coach</strong>: There's gonna be some biblical shit if you do that again! <br/><strong>Nick</strong>: Unless you want to pick up your teeth from the ground, stop shooting me! <br/><strong>Rochelle</strong>: Oh no you didn't just shoot me! <br/><strong>Ellis</strong>: Keep shooting me. Ain't helping you anyhow.
</div></li></ul></li><li> In "The Parish" with the lot filled with car alarms, the survivors will yell at you if you keep triggering them, causing them to say things like "WOULD YOU STOP SHOOTING THE GODDAMN CARS!?" or "YOU WANNA SHOOT CARS?! LET'S SHOOT CARS!"
</li><li> Nick's criminal nature is best revealed through shooting him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Nick</strong>: Shoot me again, come on, shoot me again, I dare you. <br/><strong>Nick</strong>: Shoot me again and I'll bury you alive.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a>: Blue Shift</em>, it's possible to jump over a railing to the floor below. Do this and the scientist in the room will exclaim "My God, what are you doing?!"
<ul><li> The original <em>Half-Life</em> and that microwave casserole. S'okay, you're forgiven for it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Episode Two</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Half-Life: Opposing Force</em> also lets you pull something like this  when on the sniper range during the tutorial, turn and shoot your Drill Instructor. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">And then enjoy your time in prison.</a> You can also throw things out of alignment in both <em>Opposing Force</em> and <em>Blue Shift</em>, with the game citing a "Chronological Paradox" and ending.
<ul><li> Given what happens to the protagonist in <em>Opposing Force</em> at the end, it's a toss-up between whether getting annihilated during the Seven-Hours War while stuck in Ft. Leavenworth is a better or worse fate.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, at the start of <em>Blue Shift</em>, you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">jump on top of a scientist</a> sitting on a sofa and fire your gun through the newspaper he's reading without repercussions. Try this on the <em>donut</em> the fat guard near the shooting range is holding, however, and the donut will bleed  and you get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">thrown in jail</a> for killing a civilian!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> also features the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> "Subject demonstrated extremely poor judgment" which appears if you climb over the railing and leap to your doom in the <em>Highway 17</em> chapter.
<ul><li> The civilians in <em>Half-Life 2</em> will complain ("Stop that!") if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential">conk them on the noggin</a> with a bottle or whatever. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessMooks">Civil Protection</a> officers are... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">less tolerant</a>.
</li><li> If there are major NPCs in plot-important conversations, however, they don't react at all. Meaning you can throw books, computer monitors, and wooden crates at their heads as they discuss how you are to be the savior of the universe.
</li></ul></li><li> Also in the original <em>Half-Life</em>, although you're generally allowed to kill anyone you like, including scientists and security guards (provided you survive their retaliation), there are many situations where a scientist or guard is required to open a door or such, in which case killing them (or allowing them to die) earns you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> ("Subject failed to utilize human resources"). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in this case since otherwise you'd be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">stuck</a> and not necessarily realize it.
<ul><li> And even if a security guard isn't necessary to progress, friendly fire causes them to say something threatening and start shooting you. They can be easily killed, however.
</li><li> Also, the lone exception to the above is the scientist at the start of the first game who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">supposed to be</a> Eli Vance  find a way to kill him, and the door he unlocks for you opens on its own.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">Killing yourself</a> sometimes triggers this, too. If you jump into the Xen portal before the scientists tell you it's ready, the last thing you hear before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">dying messily</a> is one of the scientists scolding you for being such an idiot. Regardless of how much health you have, the same thing also happens if you jump into the portal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">before it starts up</a>!
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Scientist</strong>: FREEMAN, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFool">You Fool!</a>!
</div></li></ul></li><li> Deliberately killing squadmates in the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> games will lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> and a message that reads "Friendly fire will <em>not</em> be tolerated!". It's funnier when playing as the Soviets in <em>World At War</em> or <em>CoD2</em>; instead, the message will say "You are a traitor to the Motherland!".
<ul><li> Also in the first sniper mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a> 4</em>, if you cause a firefight and survive, your commanding officer will chew you out with comments like, "The word 'stealth' doesn't mean much to you, does it?" But you can jack around as much as you want and the worst he'll do is bitch you out.
<ul><li> Reznov will do something similar if you attack the first patrol that comes in after your sniper massacre at the start of the game (and the game drops his health down to ludicrously low levels, showing that it <em>wants</em> him or you to die). If you dispatch the Germans and escape from the tank, he will chew you out for endangering the mission and tells you that he considers you expendable.
</li></ul></li><li> Playing as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaziZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaziZombies">Tank Dempsey</a> in <em>Black Ops</em> and running out of ammo will result in him yelling <em>Hey Player! DROP THE CHIPS AND GET ME SOME AMMO!!</em>
<ul><li> In the same game's campaign mode, your allies will yell a variety of nasty things at you if you accidentally shoot them. There's actually quite a few of them, based on who you're hitting; Bowman and Hudson are content with simply yelling, "Friendly fire!", while Weaver responds with a sarcastic, "Your side, <em>your side</em>!". Woods seems to take it the worst; if shot, he angrily shouts things like "<em>Watch it</em>, Mason!" and "If you do that again, I will <strong>KILL</strong> you!".
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>MW3</em>, shooting your own character while you're controlling the UGV gives you the message <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">"You killed yourself"</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsRepublicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsRepublicCommando">Star Wars: Republic Commando</a></em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> games, and pretty much any number of shooters with AI-controlled allies, pestering friendlies excessively will draw complaints from said NPCs. Repeated offenses will eventually get you killed. Also seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>, though your allies don't turn on you for being a jerk... offline, that is.
<ul><li> The best <em>Republic Commando</em> friendly fire complaint comes from Sev: "You're a waste of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SendInTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SendInTheClones">good genes</a>, sir."
</li><li> If you constantly give Scorch conflicting orders, he will say something along the lines of "your orders scare and confuse me, Sir."
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericasArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericasArmy">America's Army</a></em>, if you shoot an instructor during the training missions, the mission will end, the screen will fade to black, and then reveal you to be in a jail cell with harmonica music playing in the background.
<ul><li> Also happens if you either kill a teammate or kill enough teammates during multiplayer.
</li></ul></li><li> Entering a train tunnel on the second level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood">Blood</a></em> gives the player messages to the effect of "This is not a very good idea.". If the player continues, he gets run over by a train. Worth mentioning is that there's another train at the start of the tunnel (facing the tunnel entrance), which the player has to board to continue. One wonders how the two trains met without destroying each other.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a> 2</em>, when you begin the game as Vasilli in the Russian Campaign. In the tutorial level, you can do two hilarious things: One is when the commander orders you to strike the mannequin with the end of your rifle. Shoot it and you'll hear him complain. Repeat for fun. Another is when he orders you to go get a weapon. Wait a while and he'll shout, "Kill the traitor!" and everyone kills you.
</li><li> There's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorActionSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorActionSequence">Elevator Action Sequence</a> halfway through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">First Encounter Assault Recon</a></em> where the Replica repeatedly force an elevator you're riding in to stop and open into a room full of enemies. You're meant to stay in the elevator and wait for it to close and ascend again, but you can also run out and kill all the Replica that attack you. Doing the latter causes the person you're escorting to shout, "You don't have to kill <em>everybody!</em>"
<ul><li> If you pal around during the very first area in the sequel, your partner will mention what you do to your CO, such as "Becket was taking a bath" if you jump in the fountain, or "Becket was admiring the scenery" if you stand around.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune">Soldier of Fortune</a> II</em>: "Mullins, get back here! Mullins, you are jeopardizing the mission! Execute him!" :<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedStandingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedStandingUp">dies standing up</a>:
</li><li> In the first level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Prey2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Prey2006">Prey (2006)</a></em>, jumping on the slot machines will cause Jen to yell at you "Tommy, knock it off!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga">Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a></em>, on the finale mission to Korriban, if you kill too many Jedi, they turn on you and try to kill you right along with the cultists, as having gone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a> in a non-standard fashion. The finale mission is a two-parter, and they only do it for whichever part it happens in, though. Also, the mission is still able to be completed. This mechanic makes it difficult under some mods, when you want to have realism turned on for the lightsabers fully.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade">Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</a></em> features neutral civilians who you typically are expected to save from Nod soldiers. Shooting the civilians instead causes your commanding officer to threaten you with court-martial. Of course, this also happens if you shoot the chefs in Nod barracks, which is kind of hard to avoid because, despite being counted by the game as neutral characters, they will attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">kill you with a flamethrower</a> if they see you.
</li><li> If you go on a killing spree by slaughtering innocent civilians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">PAYDAY: The Heist</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection">Bain</a> will warn you to watch where you're shooting, and then he'll ask if you have gone mental should you keep doing it.
</li><li> Pointing your gun at Elizabeth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> will cause her to sidestep out of the way (useful if she has genuinely gotten in your way) and eventually tell you angrily to stop.
</li><li> Done in-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a>: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep</em>. At one point, the party needs to negotiate with the Dwarf King. Brick wins the roll to choose who negotiates, impulsively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkToTheFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkToTheFist">decides to punch him</a>, and rolls a 20.

Also, the female Pianta in the ladies' room will chastise Mario for being in there. And if you get enough coins and talk to the Pianta sweeping the air ducts, he'll call you a greedy little coin grubber.
</li><li> In Pianta Village Episode 5 (entitled "Secret of the Village Underside"), there's a green male Pianta who's talking to a pink female Pianta. If you talk to him, he'll get mad at you for disturbing their talk and chuck you in the air.

Shooting <em>grenade</em> eggs at Jr.'s eggshell gets an appropriate response from Tiptup.

Classic Sonic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> uses all of them, going through the foot-tapping, wrist-checking, pointing, and lying down in that order.

If you move the cursor over <em>her</em>, she says, "I'm not for sale." Clicking on her then will get you thrown out.
</li><li> The Journey of Me is a short flash platformer that revolves around this (and a few other concepts). The character you are playing as will constantly call you out on your actions.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em>, there are two targets (one is in Level 18, the other in Level 15) where you have to open the cover of box in time for an energy ball to be knocked into the receptacle that's in the box behind a cover. If you end up in the box, GLaDOS informs you that by no fault of the Enrichment Center, you've trapped yourself in the box and it will now open an escape passage for you.
<ul><li> GLaDOS also reacts when you knock down a security camera with a portal. The first few times, she admonishes you. After a while, she gives up on getting you to stop and simply announces "Vital Testing Apparatus destroyed" for each camera you remove. Occasionally, picking up a fallen camera will cause it to say "You are not a good person. You know that, right?"
</li><li> The Flash Version-inspired mod (the one later released by Valve as <em>Portal: Still Alive</em>) also used this line, in situations that are far easier to get into. Oh, and you also die for no apparent reason.
</li><li> There are at least three more places where you could get stuck if it weren't for the game:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM79WTn-RLQ">Chamber 4<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: You can prop the cube against the door, open the door, and knock the cube to the opposite side.
</li><li> Chamber 5: You can proceed as you normally would (getting both cubes) and open the door, shoot the blue end of the portal through the door, then stack up the cubes so you can climb back on top of the platform where the orange portal is. Once there, you can grab the top cube and put it through the orange portal. At this point the game plays a message about how you're not a good person, and you know that, right? (It detects the problem a little early, but if you were to then shoot the blue portal it's possible you'd be in a situation where you're stuck.)
</li><li> Chamber 17. At the end, it is possible to seal yourself in the room with the button that opens the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator if you put the companion cube on the big button as normal, block the door from closing with cameras, remove the cube, go inside the room, and remove the door props. The game recognizes the situation and plays a similar message if the cube is in the room with you, but unfortunately does not if the cube is outside the room when you do this.
</li><li> Chamber 13 permits you to do it two times. First, you must bring both boxes into the starting room, take them off the button that opens the door to the second room and return through a portal to the second room before sealing yourself in by removing those portals. This will open the gate of the first and second rooms. You must then open the gate to the exit and make a portal into that area, throw both cubes through, and seal yourself in the second room again.
</li><li> Chamber 14 can open a door if you manage to throw the cube upward, next to or into the emancipation field at the exit.

</li></ul></li><li> There's a weird one in an old game called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfThunder">God of Thunder</a></em>. "Why did you go and eat a poisonous shrubbery?" Well, I was just trying the "use" command on it, you could have just said it was poisonous if my character knew that but I didn't. I didn't even know to "use" this item was to eat it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyRoomsOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyRoomsOfDeath">Deadly Rooms of Death</a></em>, when the "cut scene" scripting command is activated, all monsters continue moving as normal, but the player has no control. That doesn't affect much in the official holds, since cutscenes are only used in plot-only rooms with no monsters... with one exception. In <em>The City Beneath</em>, there's a room where a goblin comes towards you, and you're meant to kill it and then approach some NPCs, triggering a cutscene. Leaving the goblin alive and turning your back to it, so that it kills you in the cutscene, earns the achievement "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Who Wants to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">Be the Guy</a>?"

Clicking on it 3 times in a row will cause the unit to give its general "standing by" message. The 4th time, depending on the unit, you'll get a message that kind of translates to "are you OK?" Once again, this depends on the unit (Protoss Carriers do this, their first annoyance message being "Our enemies are legion..."). The fifth time, the unit will express a thorough measure of disgust that you've called on it so many times without actually having it do anything (Protoss Carriers finish the statement made on click four with "...and still you procrastinate!" Do it again, and the Carrier captain will even threaten to relieve you of your authority if you don't start giving orders soon). If the unit is mechanical or biological but nonspeaking, it will give a beep or grunt thoroughly different than what it has been giving, also meant to convey disinterest or disgust.

In one village, a villager compliments you on your horse (which, as you know, is actually the transformed princess), and asks if you'll sell it to them. You're given the option to say yes or no, though of course, if you choose 'yes', the (also transformed and along for the ride) king gets utterly enraged. Doesn't affect the rest of the game, though.
<ul><li> Try refusing to escort the princess at the wedding at least once. The king will just <em>glare</em> at you. Worth it.

However, if you walk away from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the blind Fair Lady while wearing the Old Witch's Ring</span> without ending the dialogue properly, she starts panicking and asking where you are, or rather, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where her sister whom you've just killed in cold blood has went</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em>, NPCs have no particular reactions if you walk away from them without ending the dialogue properly, nor do they scold you for not taking any purchase, except Patches, who still calls you out for not buying his stuff.

(This message is the game stepping briefly out-of-character to tell you that a character considered necessary for the main quest has died and that this could have rendered the Main Quest impossible to complete for that playthrough. Later <em>Elder Scrolls</em> games would cause this "essential" tag to simply make a character impossible to kill.)

Talking to Arngeir after doing so will earn you a furious speech, and being shunned from any further interaction with the group.
</li><li> On the other hand, the Blades will refuse to assist you towards the end of the game if you decide not to do the deed. Essentially, you're forced to decide whether you want the perks of the Greybeards (finding words of power) or the Blades (hunting dragons) more. In either case, you can expect the opposite site to react in accordance with this trope.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityGuards">City Guards</a> will whine at you for randomly Shouting in town.
</li><li> More than a few of the followers seem to be aware that their purpose is to carry items for you. This goes from Lydia's sarcastic "I am sworn to carry your burdens" to Marcurio angrily declaring that he is an apprentice mage, not a pack mule. In the <em>Dawnguard</em> expansion, Serana's "trade equipment" dialogue consists of her hoping that you won't just dump all the heavy stuff you don't want to carry on her.
</li><li> Your companions will say things along this line if you attack them. Though most of the time (if you aren't killing them on purpose), it's in a close heated battle in which they keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">walking between you and the enemy</a> hitting them by accident.
</li><li> Jarl Balgruuf will personally call you out if you side with the Stormcloaks and join them in sacking Whiterun. And if Lydia is your follower, he gives one to <em>her</em> too!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIII">Ultima Exodus</a></em> has a feature where you can fight civilians  but <em>everyone</em> turns into a guard, which means fighting eight of them at once.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII">Ultima VII</a></em>, your party members will complain (and eventually quit the party) if you take things that do not belong to you.

(For example, giving an item called "Alistair's mother's amulet" to Morrigan.) Each character will refuse the gift with their own customized snarky comment, from "no, bad idea, terrible idea" to "what? Are you out of your mind?"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, Aveline's starting equipment includes her husband's shield. Like all starting equipment, it is quickly replaced by a better one. In Act 2, years later, you can find a shield to give to Aveline as a gift. If you did what most players would do and sold her starting shield, she will reply with "I had a perfectly good shield. Wesley's. We sold it, didn't we? Practicality over sentiment, right?" On the other hand, if you kept the darn thing, she will say "What are you trying to say? Should I just throw away Wesley's shield?"
<ul><li> And who can forget your friends' reactions if you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gave Fenris back to Danarius? Anders excluded, of course</span>.

However, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a> will usually point out how rare a species a Whacka is. And if you keep whacking him, he'll eventually get more and more confused sounding, and then eventually dissolves into coins, indicating that you may have actually killed him. "But you'd never do that, right Mario?" Even more heartbreaking in <em>Super Paper Mario</em>, as there is a little girl who is friends with Whacka... and once she realizes that Whacka isn't coming back, she doesn't take it too well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">to say the least.</a> The item description for the Whacka bump in that game is even tagged with "...How do you sleep at night?"

When you find him later as an NPC, he'll keep talking about how Mario is apparently just some guy who goes around committing indiscriminate acts of violence and has tons of pent-up anger.

After a short quest chain, she eventually reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Evil Lord you just fought was a fake, and that she's actually a monster crafted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper">Grim Reaper</a> to act as a decoy while he prepares the Spell of Destruction</span>. Despite this, you can still choose to befriend her when she's about to say goodbye. If you say yes, you'll run into her again at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ruins of</span> the first village <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">along with the townspeople, who shed their human guises after you broke the Reaper's curse</span>. The Time Goddess tells you that the only way to get to the Reaper's castle is through Sasha and the monsters. If you kill her, she cries out "Liar..." before dying, and you get branded with the "Liar" title when the quest is complete.

Additionally  and obviously  friendly fire is a sometimes frustrating, sometimes amusing possibility for both you and the enemy. It's always convenient when an enemy blows themselves or each other up trying to get at you. It happens. However, if <em>you</em> do it, you will inevitably get scolded. They refer to each other by name, and sometimes it's downright amusing; 'What the hell, Vashyron, you got a problem with me?' and 'I'm feeling a little bit threatened' from Zephyr, to 'Watch where you point that thing, Leanne!' 'What what that? Your bullets were all over the place!' from Vashyron and various other snarks. Some call you out on stupidity, some are just grumpy.
<ul><li> You also scold yourself for these moments; a particularly amusing one is Zephyr's "Great, now I'm hitting <em>Leanne</em>." It ranges from "Sorry, Zephyr!" from Leanne, to variations on 'oops', 'sorry', or <em>'that's</em> not good' from everyone.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em>, killing a rabbit earns you the achievement 'Hunter'. The achievement's text reads: 'Kill a sweet, innocent, fluffy bunny rabbit (remember, safety's off!)'
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII">Fable III</a></em>, like the others in its series, is well-known for the drama you can cause when marrying more than one NPC. Your butler Jasper calls you out on the callousness of your actions as he prompts you through your second (or third, or fourth) simultanous marriage.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Jasper:</strong> Now you must choose or buy a home for your new family. Or perhaps you'd like to simply buy another family.

Repeatedly triggering the confirmation dialog and saying no to it will eventually cause Mario to change poses when the player finally answers yes. This secret was apparently only discovered in the late 2000s, well after the game's release. There are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irR6QQ5_2Ik">conflicting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGtHtBJ9IyI">reports<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about the exact number of times one must say no, however.
<ul><li> During the part where you recruit Mallow, you can actually refuse to let him join you, which causes him to start crying again. If you talk to one of the Mushroom NPCs after doing this, he chastises you for being a jerk to Mallow and making him cry.
</li><li> After a big conversation in the Mushroom Kingdom castle after recruiting Princess Toadstool the first time, just leave the castle, then try to leave the Mushroom Kingdom <em>without</em> recruiting Toadstool the second time. Oops. Toadstool doesn't want you to leave her.
</li><li> Earlier, when Toadstool first joins you after completing Marrymore, the game will force you to leave via the southeast entrance, back to the Mushroom Kingdom. Going northwest instead will get you yelled at by each of your party members in turn, ending with Geno worrying that <em>they'll</em> be labelled kidnappers if they don't return the princess soon.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanLegends">Mega Man Legends</a> 2</em> one of the first levels has you guiding Roll through a snow field. If you attempt to use your default sub weapon, the Grabber, on her, she will turn and slap you. If your health is low enough, she can kill you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TaskMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TaskMaker">TaskMaker</a></em>, attacking an NPC whose orientation is Good or Neutral will anger all other NPCs around the player (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">even monsters</a>) and cause them to attack you, often making "What the hell, player?"-esque comments. Doing so in Castle Hall or any other town with Guards present will also alert the guards, no matter how far away they are from the player. This goes a step further with the "Mom" character in Enitsirhc  if you attack her to the point of frightening her (which happens when an NPC's HP is low), she will tell you "You're making a big mistake!" And if you kill her, your player will permanently be rendered blind, deaf, and drunk (i.e., completely unable to finish the game).
</li><li> If, during a quest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, you use a spade on a dog's grave, you'll get the message "You wouldn't seriously consider digging up poor Snowy, would you?"
<ul><li> There's a unique "Brassican" component for Invention that can be found by disassembling cabbages. Its description text is: "Come on, are you even taking this seriously?!"

He doesn't stop until you give him one.
<ul><li> Even the game's <em>website</em> gets in on the fun. If you hover over the busty barmaid's breasts, she will slap your cursor away. If you keep it up, the site takes you to a page explaining the unacceptability of sexual harassment.
<ul><li> If you hover over The Bard's crotch, he will likewise voice his annoyance.

</li><li> The original example comes from the first, when battling against Revolver Ocelot, with the ArmsTech president surrounded by C4 tripwires.

</li></ul></li><li> During the tanker mission in the second game, you can use your camera to take pictures of pretty much anything.

Sending him pictures of the private regions of the male guards will cause him to exclaim, "Snake! Stop it! You're freaking me out!" Finally, he has at least 3 unique responses to you sending him pictures of the Marine commander repeatedly, the best one being, "Commandant again... Look, if you like him so much, I'll print this out and make a panel out of it, put it over your bed or something."
<ul><li> About Olga, after knocking her out, if you shoot her, Otacon will interrupt you and say "Snake!! She's defenseless! Are you some kind of monster?!" Shooting her more will cause Otacon to berate Snake more.

Getting killed here gets a variant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a> mentioned above, where Vattic winces at photographs of the WinterICE team's corpses, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> basically says "They're all dead and it's all your fault!"
</li><li> Additionally, in one of the early levels, just after getting the body-projection power, in the psych ward, it's possible to lock yourself in a padded cell by using your newest power to exit the cell and lock it from outside. This leads to John saying something along the lines of "Well, <em>that</em> was brilliant. Now what do I do?" After a minute or so, the door opens, if nobody (such as a guard) opens it to get at you.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> does this on several occasions. For example, presenting Pearl with a piece of evidence with blood on it causes Phoenix to chew out the player for showing something so violent to a kid. Plus presenting the photo of Edgeworth's dead father to Edgeworth prompts Maya into shouting at you for showing something so tragic to him.

The purest example is probably what happens when you walk into a broom closet and just stay there for several minutes; the narrator first attempts to prod you into leaving and explain that there's nothing to do in the broom closet, then makes fun of you for staying in there, then concludes that the player must have <em>died at their keyboard</em> and shouts for another player to come pick up the game. If you go into the broom closet again after the game restarts, you get different dialogue, and if you try it on a third run, the broom closet is boarded up.

Repeatedly walking over the same tin can will cause the same NPC to give you an endless stream of these comments.
<ul><li> And if you even looked at something that isn't yours, or red texted, everyone or at least someone will say that is not yours or says that is locked for a reason.

Given enough unhappy thoughts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Fun ensues.</a>
</li><li> Dwarves will also get negative thoughts if the player makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice">a conviction for a crime that makes absolutely no sense at all</a> (such as a pet, a corpse, or the victim).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire">L.A. Noire</a></em>, if you run into various things and pedestrians, your partner will make comments about it.
<ul><li> Particularly amusing is that, after enough comments from your partner, Cole will give a very annoyed "Just shut up and let me drive."
</li><li> Additionally, driving away and leaving your partner behind will earn you a rebuke when they finally catch up.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a>: Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, the first mission you're given has you assisted by a fireteam of rookie stalkers to raid a Bandit base (depending on the difficulty level, you WILL need their help). If you tell them to back off, the leader will call you out on being a Rambo wannabe. If you wipe out the bandits all by yourself, he'll be amazed. If you run back to him without killing them all, he'll make fun of you and tell you to piss off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a> 2</em>, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew">Badass Crew</a> will chew you out if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy">Drive Like Crazy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hit non-hostile ships or stations enough times (whether accidentally or on purpose) and the sector police will warn you that if you keep it up, they'll attack. Continue, and you'll get a message saying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice">Space Police</a> are coming after you, after which the station or ship will turn hostile and the sector police will attack. This becomes annoying during station defense missions, where friendly fire to the station you're protecting is a constant hazard.
<ul><li> And then you can usually prevent an encounter with the police by opening a comm channel with them and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">blaming the weapons' targeting system</a>. Thankfully, stations gone hostile from friendly fire while you are protecting them become friendly after completing the mission.
</li></ul></li><li> A more specific example happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XBeyondTheFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XBeyondTheFrontier">X:BTF</a></em> tutorial if you shoot at the Terran mothership. The flight controller will give gradually escalating "cut it out" remarks and eventually threaten to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">reassign you to a radar station in Alaska</a>. Shoot it again, and he'll <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">actually do it</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> lets you do a whole bunch of nasty things to your friends and allies if they're not on a mission with you:
<ul><li> You can choose to kill the other player characters and related NPCs, only for them to respawn later and them texting you to complain about what you did. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">They also give you their hospital bill.</a>
</li><li> If you happen to run into another player character, you can follow them and have them get freaked out over your stalking. Keep doing it after they tell you to knock it off and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">they'll punch/headbutt you in response</a>.
</li><li> You can have Franklin kill his dog, Chop, with explosives or fire (Franklin won't fire bullets directly at Chop). Chop will respawn later, but whatever happiness that was built up will be completely erased.
</li><li> As Franklin or Trevor, shooting a rocket at Michael's house has him sending you a text message telling you to <a class="urllink" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=798665594">stop firing rockets at his house<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Do it again and he calls you directly, yelling at you to stop. Franklin will also give a similar response if you fire rockets at his house when not playing as him.
</li><li> At random times, you can see Jimmy riding around on his bicycle. You can be a total jerk by ramming him off his bike, even when playing as his father, Michael.
</li><li> While you can pretty much do this with any character, playing as Michael while taking Jimmy or Amanda out for a hang-out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy">driving like a crazy person</a> (going airborne, running people over, crashing into other drivers, etc.) will have them yell at you. This becomes even more hilarious if you do this after finishing the game, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Michael promised to become a better husband and father</span> and pissing his family off makes him look like a total hypocrite.
</li><li> Driving poorly  colliding with other cars, etc.  will often result in the character being played complaining at you. On the other hand, near-misses while driving also generate comments aimed at the player (i.e. Michael might say "You got lucky, buddy!")

<ul><li> And here's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebOriginal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebOriginal">Web Original</a>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/StuartAshen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/StuartAshen">Stuart Ashen</a>'s <em>Ashen's Tech Dump</em> episode 2, a video game called <em>Vinnie the Vole's Existential Nightmare</em> begins by immediately informing the player that 'YOUR ACTIONS HAVE DAMNED VINNIE'. Later when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vinnie goes insane and commits suicide,</span> the game ends with a black screen with a single message: 'YOUR FAULT'.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpriteComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpriteComic">Sprite Comic</a> example: In <a class="urllink" href="http://www.captainsnes.com/2003/10/11/399-dance-crazed/">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CaptainSNES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CaptainSNES">Captain SNES: The Game Masta</a></em> comic, we discover one of the many signs of Alex's gameplay prior to ending up in Videoland affecting Videoland: he (and by proxy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Cecil</a>) had the Mithril Town dancers dance <em>347 times</em>, much to their irritation, to say the least.
</li><li> As the host of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em>, Bob Barker was fond of this whenever a contestant did not seem to understand either how to play the game or price an item.
</li><li> Similar to the above, Steve Harvey will really lay into a player on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud">Family Feud</a></em> if they say something stupid, raunchy, offensive, or any combination of the three.

</li><li> Not exactly a game, but the text-to-speech program <em>ReadPlease</em> had the characters ask you to stop clicking on their faces, and asked how much the user would like it if <em>their</em> face was clicked upon.

</li><li> A faux game example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor">CollegeHumor</a></em> did a video imagining the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> as an SNES era video game.

Obviously. Because, you know, he's ten!</em>
</div></li><li> In the <em>Weep</em> adventure compilation for <em>Unknown Armies</em>, the adventure <em>A Few Of My Favorite Things</em> ends with the players in the back of an ambulance with a sick old man, while the ambulance is attacked by possessed cars. The adventure instructions include a "What the Hell, Player" ending, actually written as: "If for some bizarre reason the PCs hurl the old man's body out of the back of the ambulance at any point.."
