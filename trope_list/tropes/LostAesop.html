</div></div><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>, the writer has a lesson to teach to the audience. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">Hard Truth Aesop</a>, the writer has a rather unconventional and possibly offensive message to give to the audience. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>, the writer is aiming for an Aesop without realizing (s)he's undermined that Aesop in the course of the story. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop">Clueless Aesop</a>, the Aesop gets mishandled because the writer simply could not handle the issue properly.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>In a Lost Aesop, however, it's not entirely clear whether the writer ever knew exactly what kind of Aesop they were aiming for in the first place.
</p><p>This is when the audience is clearly presented with a lesson, only to have that moral <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">contradicted</a>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">reinstated</a>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">forgotten about</a>, then addressed, then ignored... you get the picture. It gets so messy that it's no longer clear exactly <em>which</em> Aesop has been broken and which one did the breaking. At some point, certain viewers or readers will begin to have doubts about whether the writer knew what they were doing.
</p><p>The most usual form of this trope is when the audience is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">whacked over the head</a> with the moral-of-the-story, only for the plot to ignore that moral and set off in pursuit of another, different one. It's as if the writer changed their minds halfway through the narrative. Note that there is no debate about this; no character will state "Hey, see that lesson we learned half an hour ago? We were wrong." Also, unlike a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>, there is nothing subtle about this: one Aesop is explicitly explained only to be undermined equally as clearly. Eventually, the audience will be buried under a number of conflicting messages, stuck going back and forth between them and unable to tell where the writer was originally going with this.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Another common variant is where the Lost Aesop comes about as a result of a writer going deeper into a subject than they could really afford to. Their characters examine all the angles, discuss possible outcomes and argue with each other, but then the writer realizes that <em>they themselves</em> don't know the answer to the question being posed... or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline">they realize that they've run out of time and have to wrap things up in a hurry</a>... or the issue is one that's so polarizing that they can't really pick a side without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">getting a lot of people</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">mad at them</a>, so they pick a random Aesop and stick with it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotThreads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotThreads">Plot Threads</a> be damned. The most successful resolution is usually to opt for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenMeanFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenMeanFallacy">"middle road"</a> between the two conflicting lessons. However, if the logic of the story has become too confused, or several Aesops are vying for the top spot, the author might simply choose the one that makes for the simplest ending. It might work, or it might come off as a half-hearted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>On the other hand, there is a very deliberate employment of this trope, where the writer presents a number of possible lessons or morals to be taken from the events of the story... only to conclude that since they all contradict each other, the answer is that there is no answer. This, however, will probably be spelled out for the viewer rather than quietly ignored.
</p><p>To identify the Lost Aesop, ask yourself whether watching two different segments of the same show would result in getting two different messages. If you manage to <em>find</em> a Lost Aesop, please return it to the address listed on its collar and inform the rest of us so we can stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">pondering over the glaring discrepancies that we only noticed upon turning the television off</a>.
</p><p>Some would argue that, if the above definition is to be used as a guide, then <em>every</em> Aesop should be a Lost Aesop if it's meant to be gracefully presented. Life is so complex that there's rarely, if ever, a single overriding lesson to learn for any scenario, despite what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleIssueWonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleIssueWonk">some people</a> think; besides that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">nobody likes a really blatant and intelligence-insulting message</a>. Furthermore, due to the fickle nature of human reasoning, it is possible for two people to glean two equally valid — or even contradictory — lessons from the same presentation. If you tell a friend who holds very left-wing political opinions that a disgruntled person entered a building full of people and opened fire on everyone in sight, you might get the interpretation of "Guns are dangerous"; if you told the same story to an equally right-wing friend, you might then be told something like "If everyone else in that building had been carrying a gun, the shooter wouldn't have dared open fire" (i.e., guns save lives).
</p><p>While it's obviously a more confused (and less subtle) cousin of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>, the Lost Aesop also claims kinship to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoYoPlotPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoYoPlotPoint">Yo Yo Plot Point</a>, since it's the recurring nature of a relatively small "error" that sets up a whole lot of confusion. The fact that the Lost Aesop seems more likely to occur in works that are produced by a group rather than a single person might also suggest the reason for the mangled moral was that the opinions and viewpoints of the writing team varied greatly. Meanwhile, it is the polar opposite of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop">Captain Obvious Aesop</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnvilOfTheStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnvilOfTheStory">Anvil of the Story</a>. This is not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a>, where a moral is set up but suddenly forgotten a few works later.

(We're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">still trying to figure out</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">what, if any, Aesops that show had</a>.)

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars">Beastars</a></em> can't really decide whether its Aesop is that racism and segregation are wrong, or a necessary measure to maintain the peace of society. The stifling atmosphere caused by forcing carnivores into lifestyles that they're not suitable for is shown to breed lots of unnecessary, prejudice-based resentment between them and the herbivores that needs to be fixed. On the other hand, it's also shown that without any restrictions placed on them, carnivores would be killing and eating herbivores, and that creating a voluntary, egalitarian society where both groups live in peace is nearly impossible due to that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits">Chobits</a></em> lost its Aesop as it navigated the issue of human-Persocom relationships. Hideki begins the series with the belief that Persocoms are machines, and a relationship with such an object is no substitute for human interaction. We meet Yumi, who suffers from an inferiority complex because she feels that she, as a human girl, can't compete with "perfect" persocoms, and Takako, who exemplifies Yumi's worst fears: her husband <em>completely forgot her</em> because he was so obsessed with their Persocom. We also meet Minoru, who has built a persocom as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">replacement</a> for his dead older sister. This is presented as understandable... but also unhealthy. So far, so good, since everything lines up with the original message. As the series progresses, however, Hideki falls in love with his own Persocom, Chi, and the "robots can't replace humans" sentiment goes flying out the window. At the end of the story, all the moral and social implications of a society that finds companionship in machines rather than other people are either abandoned or quickly swept under the carpet in favour of the message "it's okay to love an object, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning">because the fact that you love it makes it worthy of love.</a>"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACentaursLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACentaursLife">A Centaur's Life</a></em> has strong themes about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops">how racism is bad</a>. Except that it goes so far that the society depicted is restrictive to the point that accidental racism is a crime that will get someone sent to a reeducation center (accidental racism being things like riding on a centaur's back because she picked you up to carry you to get medical aid after you collapsed due to exhaustion), coming across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a>.
</li><li> The Central arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em> starts with the moral that creativity is the most important thing in cooking worth fighting for, as demonstrated by Azami and Central's willingness to utterly stomp out the diversity of cuisines, chefs, and techniques of the restaurant world in the name of "true gourmet", and the protagonists' opposition to him for that very reason. But once the plot shifts to cover Erina standing up to Azami's abuse with the help of the rebels and the rebels fighting Central to rescind the others' expulsions, the moral shifts to saying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">fighting for your friends is most important</a>. Ultimately, the protagonists win <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch">without addressing whether Azami's totalitarian views on cooking have merit or not</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DriftingDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DriftingDragons">Drifting Dragons</a></em> seems to be setting up some sort of aesop, but good luck at figuring out what it is. Is it about prejudice being wrong? Sure, the protagonists face prejudice for being dragon hunters that is called out as wrong, but later on it's shown that certain groups, like humans and dragons or drakers and slayers can't coexist. Is it about ethical hunting and respect for nature? The protagonists are horrified upon learning that another ship uses poison to kill dragons, but that is quickly set aside for the more pressing issue of the dragon rampaging through the city, and Brno's complaint that the drakers are brutes destroying nature for profit is presented as valid. Giraud's and Takita's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> arcs directly contradict each other- Giraud's is about learning how not to be such an uptight worrywart, while Takita's is about learning to be more serious and determined. In the end, the only moral you're likely to get from this story is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">food tastes good</a>.
</li><li> In an example of how making an issue too complex can result in confusion, the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar">Kaleido Star</a></em> couldn't decide whether ruthless competition was a <em>good</em> or a <em>bad</em> thing. Sora's non-confrontational manner and own self-doubts cost her her position as Kaleido Star, as she was usurped by the ambitious May and the icy Leon. Later, she decides to compete against the two of them to prove her worth, with the help of ex-Bad Boy turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> Yuri Killian. At the Circus Festival itself, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> however, Sora realizes that achieving her own dreams in the contest means crushing everyone else, and ends up throwing the competition away rather than winning such a polluted and underhanded event</span>. Yet Layla berates her for her unwillingness to compete, May is <em>genuinely</em> hurt (to the point of <em>tears</em> and a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>) when Sora openly refuses to compete with her as well, and their viewpoint is presented to the audience as correct... when just a short while ago, Sora's decision not to step on other people on her way to the top was seen as a noble sentiment. The series tapers off into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">the middle road</a> of "competition <em>does</em> encourage everyone to do their best"... but it <em>does</em> leave some of the implications the show itself raised unanswered (Is it all right to trample over people who are polite and gentle? Are merciless tactics acceptable in the pursuit of stardom? Is it noble or weak to try and avoid a fight? If a rival who poses a good challenge has his/her wish rejected, is it valid for him/her to be upset or not?).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero">Re:Zero</a></em>'s main moral is about devoting yourself to others, but it flipflops on whether that is a good or bad thing. Subaru's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDulcineaEffect">obsession over Emilia</a> is meant to be cringeworthy and shallow and show that he's a narcissist who is playing hero because he believes it will make her return his feelings, and because of this he constantly makes a fool out of himself and causes himself misery. But his love for Emilia and his feelings for Rem and other characters also lead him to go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">insane lengths</a> to save the day, which he eventually accomplishes after much suffering. As well as that, Rem's love for Subaru, which causes her to make just as foolish and irrational decisions, is always portrayed positively and considered one of her best qualities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> seemed indecisive where to take Jaden between the first two seasons: the first season finale had Zane telling him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">rely on his gut instincts</a> rather than his mind, as the former is his strong suit, compared to Zane.

<ul><li> Because the Marvel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> crossover was written by multiple authors, most of whom didn't agree with the direction Marvel was going, the moral behind the story seems to jump from book to book.
<ul><li> It's okay to sacrifice liberty for security, especially when dealing with superpowered individuals — except wait, no it's not. America means freedom and righteousness and all that is good — wait, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">it means MySpace and YouTube.</a> Allowing the leaders to do their jobs is a perfectly legitimate course of action — wait, you'll get drafted into a superpowered army and made a slave of the state. Iron Man is cool — wait, he's a Nazi!
</li><li> Instead of it being "every side has some good points and some bad", nearly everybody in this comic is legitimately a villain, willing to put innocent people in danger to get what they want. Tony has perfectly valid arguments... but he takes it all too far. Cap has valid arguments against... but resorts to punching his point across. Spidey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch">is in the middle</a>. He sees Tony's side at first, but then he sees the gulag where people are being locked up forever without even getting a trial.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis">Countdown to Final Crisis</a></em> Trickster and Piper went on a journey that was intended to lead to Trickster overcoming his homophobia and learning a lesson, but the story developed to the point where Trickster received a bullet to the head due to an attack unrelated to the intended moral; no lesson was ever apparent from this resolution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAActOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAActOfGod">JLA: Act of God</a></em> is confusing and written by only one writer. Is the moral of the story that powers leads to arrogance? You're only a real super hero if you don't have super powers? You should work inside the system? Other than "Batman is awesome," it's never really clearly told.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, there was a clear effort to say <em>something</em> about relationships and obsessions - the plot involves a lonely old woman trying to change the past in order to get her lost love back, and the subplots all involve the Runaways trying to work through their various relationships. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slips</a> led to the run being truncated, creating plot holes that overshadowed the intended message.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCardsTheHardCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCardsTheHardCall">Wild Cards The Hard Call</a></em> seems to be making a statement on acceptance, beauty, and medical experimentation but what that statement is couldn't be more opaque.
<ul><li> The comic's Aesop is actually a condemnation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">Chosen One</a> plots in superhero fiction: "Just because you gained great powers in an accident, it does not mean you have some great destiny." It recognizes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> of such stories, because the flip side of that is that people who died or were crippled in accidents were destined to have bad things happen to them. In short, it is an Anti-Nihilist tract about shit happens for no reason, and people try to find a reason.
</li></ul></li><li> A very lost Aesop happened during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a>'s first run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em> (when it was a government superteam). A scientist had developed a way to test fetuses for the mutant gene, in the womb... and then would offer to abort the baby if it was a mutant. The X-Factor team was, naturally, horrified by this, especially Wolfsbane, who is both mutant and Catholic. <em>Except...</em> due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, the "abortion" option was excised, and the doctor instead was offering an in utero <em>cure</em> for the mutant gene. The team's reactions were not changed; they were still horrified, even Wolfsbane, who has often said she would be much happier if she hadn't been born a mutant. The Aesop went from being about abortion to being a vague <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">Fantastic Aesop</a> about it not being okay to de-mutantify unborn babies.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoohsGrandAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoohsGrandAdventure">Pooh's Grand Adventure</a></em> unfortunately suffers from lost aesops. The story is about coming to terms with the loss of a friend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> except Christopher Robin gets found again. This undermines any symbolism to coping with loss and undermines the self-actualization that the characters experience.

<ul><li> Lampshaded at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BurnAfterReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BurnAfterReading">Burn After Reading</a></em> where the CIA director wonders aloud what has been learned from the preceding chain of events. Being the sort of film it is, it's really anyone's guess.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CampNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CampNowhere">Camp Nowhere</a></em> seems to have <em>some</em> kind of Aesop at the end, but good luck trying to figure out what the heck it is. It could be that kids shouldn't worry about having potential and growing up, but the film's hero stands up to his father and says that it's "okay to be stupid sometimes." It could also be about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks">Growing Up Sucks</a>, but the hero <em>does</em> learn some responsibility during the movie and looks forward to dating his love interest when they're older. Maybe the lesson is that it's wrong to fool your parents and start a phony summer camp, but that was a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">Fantastic Aesop</a> even in 1994, and everyone ends up thanking the hero for the fun summer anyway, so THAT can't be it...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy">Chasing Amy</a></em> is very confused about what its Aesop even is. It starts out with something like, "it's useless to try to change someone; orientation is fixed and can't be altered to suit your convenience." That gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">broken</a> when it turns out she's conveniently bisexual after all. Then it seems to be something like "true love knows no barriers," but of course several characters in the film really <em>are</em> 100% gay, so that doesn't work. After that it's "don't get all worked up because your girlfriend has an adventurous sexual past," which would work, except that she also lied about it every step of the way, so it's at least a little more complicated than that. Then they give Silent Bob an awkward, tangentially-related monologue, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">blame the straight white guy for everything</a>, and call it a day.

This is seemingly glossed over in the first movie after Hades is stopped from usurping Olympus from Zeus, and the second movie revolves around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth">Tartarus being unleashing monsters and other abominations into the world</a> specifically because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">humans losing faith in gods</a>. It doesn't help that the gods are the only thing standing between mankind from such threats.
</li><li> <em>Fly By Night</em> is a film that doesn't know whether to praise hip-hop or condemn it. It tends to flip-flop when it comes to criticizing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcoreHipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcoreHipHop">Hardcore Hip Hop</a>, but it also seem to chastise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsciousHipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsciousHipHop">Conscious Hip Hop</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalRap">Political Rap</a> as well.

Director Godfrey Reggio contends that whatever message the audience may find in it is completely their own choice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a></em> positively revels in this to the point where, while you're sure the creator intends for you to take home some kind of message, it's impossible to work out just what that message is supposed to be. The aliens come to Earth to stop humanity from blowing up the universe, but they do this by, well, animating corpses and having them kill a few people. About the time you think old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood">Ed Wood</a> expects you to side with the aliens (not destroying the universe seems good), their destruction by the humans is presented as a happy ending. It doesn't help that all the characters are as incompetent as their creator. In the end, the only real moral you can take home from this film is that there are some films best watched with friends so you can laugh at them. It's a pretty good moral, but probably not what Wood intended.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Showgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Showgirls">Showgirls</a></em> seems to be trying to prove <em>something</em> but neither the viewers or the movie itself seem to grasp just what that message is. At first it may seem like it's trying to say that a person should never compromise their morals, where Nomi is shown refusing to put ice cubes on her breasts to make her nipples stand up and refuses to do something that's implied to be prostitution... But this would only work if the character were a legitimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold">Stripper With a Heart of Gold</a>, in that stripping was the worst thing she did. She had no problems pushing the lead dancer down the stairs to injure her, sleeping with her boss to get higher in the position to be said dancer's understudy. She seemed to be very happy with the idea of doing <em>extremely</em> graphic things on the stage of the old strip club. So "don't compromise your morals" can't work because the character's morals are borderline psychotic. Her interactions with other characters seem to indicate that the message is something about how Nomi really <em>is</em> a bad person at heart, that Cristal was right and Nomi really was a whore, who while at first denied it, began to accept it willingly or not. But then every other character in the entire movie acts as if Nomi is an absolute saint, no matter what she does. Even the girl she pushed down the stairs calls her a whore as if it were a compliment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">Star Trek: Insurrection</a></em> is a bit notorious in the fanbase for this. Is it about how racism is bad? Can't be, because most of the film is dedicated to a near-universally-evil gang of ugly mutants trying to screw over their distant kin. Is it about the return to nature and how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight">Ludd Was Right</a>? Well, no, because the heroes use all kinds of wacky technology to save the day and defeat the bad guys. Is it a metaphor for Indian relocation and the Trail of Tears? Then why are the people being relocated not actually natives, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromeCasting">why are they all white humans</a>—and didn't the show take the <em>opposite</em> tack with the Maquis, who actually <em>were</em> of American Indian descent? Is it about the folly of greed? Then why is the resource over which people fight for something as universally valuable as a medical advancement?

</li><li> In the picture book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGirlWhoNeverMadeMistakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGirlWhoNeverMadeMistakes">The Girl Who Never Made Mistakes</a></em>, a girl named Beatrice is famous for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">never making any mistakes</a> until one day she trips and drops some eggs but doesn't count that as her first mistake because she didn't break them (never mind that she didn't <em>mean</em> to trip), but it still worries her and when she makes a mistake at a talent show, she stops being concerned and joins in her brother Carl at making what the author <em>calls</em> "mistakes" but it's more like intentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">wackiness</a>. Is the moral to just accept that nobody's perfect? But don't you have a right to worry if you truly didn't make mistakes up until then because making mistakes isn't normal for you? And besides, she seemed perfectly happy until the egg incident. It could be not to pressure kids by telling them they don't make mistakes...but not many people actually do that and they weren't pressuring; they were observing. Perhaps it doesn't have a moral, but it still somehow feels like it's meant to have one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGivingTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGivingTree">The Giving Tree</a></em> is about a boy who likes a tree but then takes its branches and eventually cuts it down as he grows up. At the end, he uses the stump to sit on because he is tired. It gives off a preachy vibe, but it's unclear what the moral is. Is it "don't take nature for granted"? It could also be "this boy/man didn't enjoy life" but that's not an Aesop. Then there's the author's claims that the tree was based on his mom, which just confuses things further. Maybe it isn't meant to have an aesop at all, and is just a heartwarming story about a person who gives and gives until they have nothing left to give?

He then meets some unicorns and realises he's a unicorn and when he tells the narwhals, they already know. He has trouble deciding whether to live with the unicorns or the narwhals, but then eventually they all decide to live on/near the beach. Taken at face value, this could mean "You can live in two places at once", but obviously you can't, so maybe it's an allegory— but for what? It could be adoption but he's stated to be born underwater and dislike narwhal food. It could be being LGBT+, but he doesn't like unicorns (equivalent to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop">gay</a> or bi) or feel like he's trapped in the body of another species (equivalent to being trans) and the narwhals knew he was a unicorn from day one, so the real meaning of the story is a mystery.

However, until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster">Character Filibuster</a> at the end, there's really nothing in the novel that suggests that the characters' parents lack of involvement was to blame for their problems — or even that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">by today's standards</a>, the parents were uninvolved to begin with.
</li><li> In the children's book <em>Potty, Poo-Poo, Wee-Wee</em>, a young dinosaur named Littlesaurus is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletTrainingPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletTrainingPlot">learning how to use his potty-chair</a> but uses it for anything but pooping and peeing, poops on the floor and won't stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">shouting the book's title</a> in public despite the grown-ups (and his school friend) telling him that it is rude. Then, when his granny tells him that his dad was just the same at Littlesaurus's age, Littlesaurus starts using the potty and accepting that shouting out potty words is rude, but the adults all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSequitur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSequitur">randomly</a> shout out the book's title. So, is the moral not to tell children what to do because eventually, they'll learn better? But the adults proved otherwise by shouting the potty words. Is it that it's OK to shout potty words? But they do have a point about it being rude and even Littlesaurus eventually agrees that it's rude. Is it to use the potty? Then, what was the point of Granny Dinosaur saying that Dad was just the same? And if it's not to shout potty words, then <em>why did the adults shout the potty words at the end</em>?
</li><li> Possibly the case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReadyPlayerOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReadyPlayerOne">Ready Player One</a></em>, in which most of the events take place in an MMO <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualReality">Virtual Reality</a> called the OASIS and focuses on a world-wide treasure hunt associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">'80s</a> trivia.

Unfortunately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">the plot makes no sense</a>, and the constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">clueless references</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDonne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDonne">John Donne</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> don't help.

They try to excuse him by showing that he is shocked to see that there were civilian casualties in his indiscriminate attacks, but this just makes him dangerously <em>dumb</em>. And contrary to the prologue's message, his life has no impact, because the population is always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">100% with the terrorists</a>, would be even if he was never born, and his actions have no political consequences at all.

Then after 400 pages cheering for the terrorists, the epilogue references a (then recent) demonstration against terrorism in the Basque Country and ponders if the population doesn't actually like terrorists.

<ul><li> The show continuously flip-flops on its stance on the new way vs. the old way. On one hand, we have Buffy herself, who acts like no other Slayer before her, having family and friends. On the other hand, modern weaponry (that is, anything newer than bladed weaponry) is continuously said to be useless even though it would be quite useful (shotgun blast to the head of a vampire should at least lobotomize it, if not dust it and most guns could work wonders on demons). It gets even worse after they use a Rocket Launcher to destroy a demon that was unable to be destroyed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">"any weapon forged"</a>.
</li><li> It gets even worse with the introduction of "The Initiative". It is an effective anti-vampire unit, showing that ordinary humans can pull their weight in the fight against evil, except that it's a front for evil experiments, except that its founders were unaware of this, except they decide to scrap it anyway. Was there ever a point to it all except "Muggles will inevitably fuck everything up anyway, so they shouldn't even bother"?
</li><li> The first season episode "Witch" starts off seeming to be about parental pressure, presenting us with a shy, sympathetic girl who has been bullied by her mother into joining the cheerleading squad and is so desperate not to fail she has been using witchcraft to injure and disfigure the other candidates. Then, it seems that the girl is just psychotic and her mother is actually living in fear of her. <em>Then</em>, it turns out that the mother has actually swapped bodies with her daughter and she's the one who's been off cheerleading and disfiguring while the daughter has been left trapped in her body. Which takes the initial theme of parents reliving their teenage years vicariously through their children to extremes but completely loses the theme of teenagers going to extreme lengths to satisfy overbearing parents.
</li><li> Several times while exploring Willow and Tara's budding relationship, magic is used as a metaphor for sex, and witchcraft as lesbian sex specifically. Then suddenly Willow gets addicted to it and it's used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">metaphor for drug abuse</a>. So... lesbian sex is drug abuse?

</li><li> At the end of "Planet of the Ood," the title species deal with the villain, Mr. Halpen, who enslaved them, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTransformation">forcibly turning him into another Ood</a> and promising he'll be cared for as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">one of their own</a>. Donna doesn't quite know how to feel about this and comments that she doesn't feel she knows right from wrong anymore. The Doctor replies, "It's better that way. People who know for certain tend to be like Mr. Halpen," which sounds a lot like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> — and in no way applies to the episode we just watched. Halpen was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">amoral businessman who only cares about his profit</a>, not some kind of dogmatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> (whereas fighting against him <em>was</em> presented as a matter of plain right vs. wrong, and the Doctor and Donna certainly never seemed conflicted as to which side they should be on).

But at the end as he's reeling from Marah's betrayal, the other Rangers remind him of decisions to trust that worked out, and the "scammer" returns the bike saying that the printers must have mixed up his address on his business card. Dustin sums up, "Sometimes you just gotta trust people!" Uhh...
<ul><li> That last line was said jokingly. Also, put all together... well, one person who seemed trustworthy wasn't, and one who seemed untrustworthy was. So... don't be paranoid but do keep your wits about you. The person who repeatedly tried to blow you up probably didn't get over it in one day, but with any given human it could go either way.

<ul><li> Throughout the two-part episode "The Best of Both Worlds", Riker learns he has to be his own man if he wants to become a captain, which he does, succeeding in both saving Picard and beating the Borg, but after this episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">he goes back to being a Commander and second-in-command</a> of the <em>Enterprise</em>, not having his own command again until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis">Star Trek: Nemesis</a></em>. And it's even worse when you consider the Expanded Universe which had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Commander Shelby</a> becoming a captain <em>before</em> him. Particularly egregious given that Riker had been formally promoted, not merely made an "Acting Captain"... and it had already been established that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier">there's no rule against a ship's captain and first officer simultaneously holding the rank of Captain</a>. Then again, it's stated many times that Riker can have his choice of command, but he only wants one ship. It's not until <em>Nemesis</em> that he finally decides that he's never going to get the <em>Enterprise</em> and should stick with the <em>Titan</em> instead.
</li><li> The premise of "Ethics" is about Worf getting paralysed from an accident in the cargo bay (something falling on him). He wants to be euthanized since culturally, Klingons (his species) euthanize people with serious injuries since they consider the injuries a dishonour. Picard, somewhat unusually, supports this, but Dr. Crusher doesn't and would rather try to cure him but has no idea how. Another scientist suggests an experimental procedure but Crusher finds it too risky. However, the other scientist does the procedure and Worf recovers. It feels like there should be an Aesop (or possibly several) in there somewhere because most <em>Star Trek</em> episodes that focus on ethical concerns and/or serious topics like euthanasia tend to have them, however, it's unclear who you're meant to side with, or even if none or all of them are right. After all, the viewers clearly don't want Worf to die, but <em>Star Trek</em> typically does not go by the "ends justify the means" philosophy.

When the creature first attacked him and the ship he was serving on, 11 years earlier, he hesitated to fire at it and the creature killed half the ship's crew. In the episode itself, a young security officer on the Enterprise also hesitates when faced with the same creature, and the creature ends up killing several men. Both Kirk and the young officer blame themselves for their crewmates' deaths, and there is plenty of angst over the matter. How is this solved? Turns out that the creature is immune to phasers, and neither of the two men could've stopped it when they had the chance. The Aesop that was being set up is that "humans hesitate by nature, sometimes it can't be helped, and you can't spend your life blaming yourself for it". This is even outright explained by Spock. However it ends up being something like "failure is sometimes okay in hindsight" — which is no Aesop at all. Needless to say, once the creature is revealed to be nigh-invulnerable, the episode proceeds with the monster-hunt and never touches on any of the above in any way.

The way this is framed at first is with the congressman confirming that yes, he supports this bill, and yes, he's gay. They debate both the ideology and the politics of the situation in a series of scenes, and in the end Josh asks him how he can be a Republican. He explains that he agrees with most Republican positions and considers them to outweigh the one position he doesn't, and implies that he's hoping to change the party's attitude toward gays from the inside. This is treated as some kind of revelation for Josh... but his question and the congressman's answer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch">don't really reflect</a> the conflict brought up in that initial exchange, which is of a gay man supporting <em>this particular bill</em>. He's supposed to be a sympathetic character, but the overall impression given is that he doesn't agree with the bill at all and was just lying out of party allegiance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">which is generally frowned on by this show</a>, and letting himself be used by his fellow Republicans.

The game makes it clear that first, the villains of the DCU <em>need</em> to be stopped, that Arkham Asylum, the Phantom Zone and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">cardboard institutions</a> aren't stopping them, and that the Regime's brutal methods have been effective in putting the Joker and other villains down for keeps. By the same token, this willingness to kill has desensitized the heroes of the Regime to violence, turning them into murderous tyrants who are just as willing to kill heroes who get in their way. In the end, the game ends up with an inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">Both Sides Have a Point</a>: the Regime are bad guys, but the Insurgency has no answer to the question "so what do we do instead?"

They are definitely trying to make some kind of point involving paganism, science and Christianity, but it's a bit hard to work out exactly what simply because of the way it all comes together. The most you can really pull from it is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGrayMorality">there are no real bad guys, just people who are ruled by fanaticism</a>.

You can't say the Pagans are bad, despite them being the villains of the first game, since they are shown to be sympathetic people (the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">massacre of Pagan women and children by Mechanists</span>, and a certain book in a rotting house being good examples) who help you beat the second game in much the same way as the Hammers did in the first. We can't even say that the game is pro- or anti-science, since the Mechanists are villains obsessed with technology, but the Hammers are pretty obsessed by it too. It's not even clear if the Mechanists are an analog for communist fanatics, atheist fanatics, scientific fanatics, or religious ones. So, in the end the message is probably 'beware of getting ideological about stuff'. Or something.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> is full of these; intentionally, as often as not, especially one episode where Jake explicitly declares that there was a lesson to be learned and he avoided it.
<ul><li> The episode "My Two Favorite People" lampshaded the hell out of this trope at the end, first by having Jake put forth the Aesop that he was wrong to be jealous of his best friend Finn establishing a platonic relationship with Lady Rainicorn, Jake's girlfriend. Jake admits he was stupid, and then...
<div class="indent"><strong>Jake:</strong> Let's never be stupid again. <br/><strong>Finn:</strong> No, let's always be stupid, forever!
</div></li><li> "Another Way" also deserves special mention for how hard it decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">zig-zag</a> its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> in the last few minutes. Throughout the episode, Finn is repeatedly told that "it's the only way" when confronted with an unpleasant necessity or a choice between unpleasant options. Every time, he shouts, "No! MY WAY!" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesAThirdOption">Takes a Third Option</a>. The moral seems to be something about believing in one's own judgment or persevering in the face of discouragement or maybe rejecting false dilemmas... at least until Finn's way results in the death of an innocent bystander and he sings a sad song about how he was wrong. So the moral is about humility and avoiding rash actions that could hurt others... maybe? Nope. Finn goes on "his way" again and finds a cure-all that revives the dead bystander and everyone else who was hurt early in the episode. So we're back to the first moral, until Jake rejects Finn's miracle cure for absolutely no reason and prefers to stick to the one Finn found so objectionable at the beginning of the episode, which <em>now</em> Finn decides to accept. Whew.

We never truly find out if they're terrorists or just overly-cautious store owners and the Xbox killer is caught offscreen after he killed another victim, which makes it unclear if the message is that racial bias is right or wrong. The episode was a Lost Aesop on purpose: it was meant to be a satire of the Iraq War in which the Middle Eastern shopkeeper represented Saddam Hussein, so the idea with him was "He's a rotten person and the world's probably better without him in power, but he wasn't remotely involved in the crime we thought he was and we broke the law by going after him." Which is a valid message, but the way it was pulled off was still at odds with the other "racial profiling" plot and it was so incredibly dense that most viewers didn't get the message.
</li><li> One episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CraigOfTheCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CraigOfTheCreek">Craig of the Creek</a> focuses on Craig being the only healthy kid left when a germ starts going around.

Rather than exploring this idea (that pretty people aren't always jerks and that popularity can go to anyone's head), the rest of the plot focuses on Connie trying to win back her popularity (and shitting on Meg after she helps her reset the status quo, because the status quo involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">shitting on Meg for being Meg</a>) purely for comedic purposes.

This causes George to think that being "supportive" means not letting someone do what they want, and flees, discovering a hidden utopia full of animals in the same boat as he, and happily spend their lives perpetually scratching themselves. Thus, George <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisfitMobilizationMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisfitMobilizationMoment">rouses them all to band together</a> and teach their friends the error of their supportive ways. Now you're probably thinking the Aesop will be something along the lines of "sometimes it is necessary to endure unpleasant things," or "what you want and what you need are often two different things, and those who care about you have to put what's needed first." However, never once is there shown a downside to scratching at a jungle rash the rest of one's life, and George's friends pretend to be swayed by their performance, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey">trick them into taking the medicine</a>.

When writing the exchange, the writers intended to have the "real" Batman win with his freedom argument; however, when they gave the "evil" Batman a line about how things like the murder of the Wayne family will never happen again in the "evil" Batman's world, the writers could not think of any retort for the "good" Batman to make. They had meant for him to win the argument, but ended up convincing <em>themselves</em> that the "evil" argument was the right one (at least from the perspective of the two Batmen). Thankfully, they developed a retort for a later scene which featured one of the downsides of the totalitarian regime (someone getting carted away by the police simply for contesting a restaurant bill), and the final episode maintained its "Safety at all costs is not worth the price" message.

However, the Louds really were acting like zombies while sick and at the end, the whole family got sick anyway.

The writers can usually handle this pretty well, even though the episodes can be about anything, but they can't all be gems. Sometimes, perhaps, the story would work better without the obligatory aesop, and it shows.

Twilight defaults to being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully">Agent Scully</a> for most of the episode (although, it should be said, she does at one point try and fail to get the kind of data on the phenomenon that she could handle), until at the end she's forced to accept the phenomenon she's actually been seeing all the time with her own eyes "on faith". The point is actually stated as being that you can accept some things even if you don't understand them, but Twilight wasn't even <em>trying</em> to understand anything for most of the time, just to deny it. After people noted the apparent message that science can't explain everything and therefore you should believe in some paranormal things or something similar, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> admitted that the aesop had got lost along the way. Then again, the comment by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> about what it was really supposed to be about<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1g1wu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1g1wu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1g1wu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There are some things where the evidence is inconclusive, so you have to either remain agnostic or take it on faith one way or another. ...Okay?</span> still sounded like a lost aesop and hardly made the matter much clearer. Perhaps more to the point was her saying that it was supposed to be a funny episode about the characters' personalities interacting.
</li><li> "Over a Barrel" is about a conflict between settler ponies and Native American themed buffalo. The historical treatment of Native Americans certainly can't be discussed in it, so the conflict is one of misunderstanding and conflict of interest between equally powerful parties. But really it just seems like an excuse to put the ponies in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest">Wild West</a> setting for some reason. Pinkie Pie tries to solve the situation by singing an extremely naïve song about how "You gotta share, you gotta care" that only escalates the conflict. However, the parties are actually quite willing to compromise as soon as they figure out how. The conflict is solved mainly because it wasn't that bad to begin with. The official aesop at the end, then, is pretty vacuous, and ends with "You've got to share; you've got to care." (Pinkie Pie: "Hey! That's what I said!") If that wasn't a stealth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">Spoof Aesop</a>, it's kind of confusing; is it good to assume everyone can just be nice and get along, or not? The aesop could be taken as "Everyone can be nice and get along, but only if they actually work out the details of whatever they're arguing about. Vapid slogans alone won't do the trick."
</li><li> "A Friend in Deed" spends 90% of its runtime setting the morals that "you can't force someone to be your friend" and "some people just need their personal space, and that's okay", as shown by Pinkie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">stopping at nothing</a> to get Cranky to be her friend and refusing to leave him alone until he does. Then in the last five minutes she <em>succeeds</em> in becoming his friend through sheer force of will by realizing that another character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">introduced only in this episode</a> was Cranky's long lost love. It takes the previous moral and tacks a sort of "except when you do something really nice for them!" onto it, muddling the intent somewhat.
</li><li> "One Bad Apple" is so clumsy with its intended messages of "standing up to a bully makes you a bully as well" and "telling an adult is the solution to being bullied" that it makes one wonder if some of the cast or crew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">secretly disagreed with them</a>. In the climax of the episode, almost <em>immediately</em> after the Crusader's epiphany that they should have told an adult, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon pop up and begin bullying them right in front of Applejack who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">does nothing other than frown</a>, effectively negating aesop number one. Then Babs Seed gets in their faces and intimidates them into leaping back in fear and landing in the mud, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">effectively solving the current bullying issue by standing up to them</a> and negating aesop number two.
</li><li> "Bats!" starts with a simple enough issue of a fruit bat infestation that is threatening Applejack's crop and boils down to Applejack's argument of "get rid of them because they're a threat" against Fluttershy's argument of "but they're living creatures and can help in the long run", setting up an apparent argument of necessity vs. animal rights. Then Twilight Sparkle decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">causes much more damage by accidentally transforming Fluttershy into a vampire bat pony</a>, and somehow this wins over Applejack and they set up a reserve on the farm for the fruit bats. The initial conflict is never addressed and it instead ends on the message of "you shouldn't let anypony pressure you into doing something that you don't think is right and sometimes you have to tell even your closest friends 'no'" which wasn't even portrayed in the episode: Fluttershy spent the entire episode pressuring the others to do things they didn't think were right and refusing to take no for an answer and was portrayed as being in the right for it.
</li><li> "Princess Spike" can't seem to make up its mind at all which aesop it wants to teach. It begins with Spike going to ludicrous lengths, including making questionable decisions on her behalf to preserve the silence so Twilight Sparkle can sleep, then abruptly leaps to him forgetting all about keeping it quiet and instead abusing his relationship with her to solicit freebies from others, then all hell breaks loose when the things he tried to do to keep things quiet (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">the selfish stuff goes without consequence</a>) causes a huge mess, and then out of nowhere ends on the moral "when we all do our part everything works out in the end" which really had nothing to do with anything and actually conflicts with what was presented in the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> "Imaginary Fiend." The episode was about a boy who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> made an imaginary friend, only the imaginary friend turned out to be real. He was still imaginary, but he could move things without being seen. In the end, the Powerpuff girls invented their own imaginary friend to fight him.</span> In the beginning, the moral appeared to be "Don't invent an imaginary friend to blame on your actions," but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even Bubbles said it "Wasn't (Mike's) fault, he was evil to begin with."</span> In the end, the message seemed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when you can't battle an imaginary-realistic friend, invent your own.</span> <br/>Not to mention what Buttercup says in the end:
<div class="indent"><strong>Buttercup:</strong> But from now on, um, uh... from now on, um, uh, I can't think of anything.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> had quite a few of these in its time:
<ul><li> One episode had the children stuck inside for recess because it was raining outside. Miss Finster is delighted about this, hoping that keeping the children off the playground will turn them into mindless zombies as it did with a previous class of hers. TJ eventually gives an impassioned speech about how it's just water and can't hurt them before veering off into how adults are using the rain as an excuse to tell them what to do. He and the gang go outside to play in the rain and the sun comes out. At the end of the episode they are implied to have gotten sick from playing in the rain. So was the lesson "don't be afraid of water", "don't let adults tell you what to do", "staying indoors for too long will turn you into a zombie", "playing in the rain will make the sun come out"... you'll get a headache if you try to figure it out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Blood Feud" deliberately invoked a Lost Aesop, when the family considered various morals to the story, and then realized that no, something happened that didn't fit, before eventually concluding "It was just a bunch of stuff that happened."
</li><li> Another <em>Simpsons</em> episode with a Lost Aesop is the 10th season episode "Lisa Gets an 'A'". Lisa is forced to stay home from school because she's sick. Forced to relax instead of working, she gets addicted to a video game and falls behind on her homework. When she returns to school just in time for the test on the material she didn't read, she panics and Bart convinces her to cheat in order to pass. Later, it turns out her high score on the test brought the entire school's GPA up to its minimum standard and the school now qualifies for a grant. Even after Lisa deliberately confesses to having cheated, Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers try to have her stay quiet long enough so the school can get the grant money, feeling it would do a lot of good for the school. In the end, they trick Lisa into thinking she confessed and was pardoned, while actually just covering the whole thing up so they can collect the money. Lisa fixes her grade in the privacy of her own home, while the school staff gets the grant money and they cash it at a liquor store. What... exactly is the message of this episode? It's okay to cheat and lie as long as it helps people? No, that's not right. Could it be "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Don't worry about your grades Lisa, you're surrounded by idiots</a>"? No, measuring intelligence on nothing but academic achievements is rather asinine. Maybe it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop">Do your homework and don't abuse your sick leave?</a> Eh, too blatant. Maybe it's... you know what, forget it: let's just say the message truly lies in the subplot with Homer and his pet lobster Pinchy: If you adopt a lobster as a pet, don't give it a hot bath for too long or you'll accidentally cook it. There, satisfied.
</li><li> Yet another example in "Itchy and Scratchy The Movie":
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer:</strong> You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt, but my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage. <br/><strong>Bart:</strong> Dad, what's the point of this story? <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> I like stories.
</div></li><li> Another arises in "The Cartridge Family". In this episode, Marge and Homer are at odds over a gun he buys, which even leads Marge to briefly leave him. In the end, Homer finally agrees to let Marge get rid of the gun, so Marge heads to the nearest garbage bin to throw it out. However, seeing herself holding the gun from a reflection in the lid, she likes how dangerous and cool she looks so she decides to hold on to the gun, putting it in her purse. The writers said that there was no real message from the story, but if there was, it'd be that a man like Homer Simpson should not have a gun, so... mission accomplished?
</li><li> Parodied yet again in "Homer Goes to College." Homer announces he learned the values of diligence and study, while the nerds learned to enjoy the outside world. The nerds point out that they hated the outside world, and Lisa reminds Homer that he cheated to get a passing grade, so nobody learned anything. Marge then demands Homer take the course again, so he can actually get something out of it this time. (Funnily, the actual moral of the episode is a lot simpler: "don't assume <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollegeIsHighSchoolPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollegeIsHighSchoolPart2">College Is "High School, Part 2"</a>.")
</li><li> In "Homer Simpson in: 'Kidney Trouble'", Grandpa Simpson's kidneys explode, so Homer has to donate a kidney but wusses out, so they perform the surgery against his will. Is the moral a story of empathy? Well, no, because Homer runs away and leaves his grandfather to die. Is it about the comeuppance of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>? Well, not really, since nonconsensual surgery is hardly better than what Homer did. Is it a serious exploration of declining health? Probably not, because the entire impetus for Grandpa's kidney failure is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency">Homer wouldn't let him go to the bathroom</a>. So is it just absurd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfJerkass">World of Jerkass</a>? Maybe, but if that's the case, why does the episode treat the fact that Grandpa is suffering and probably going to die in a 100% serious fashion? It seems like the only purpose of the episode was to establish Homer as a terrible person.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played for laughs in the episode "Cartmanland": when Kyle loses his faith in God, his parents read him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfJob">the story of Job</a> to change his mind. However, they forget to mention the part where Job's faith is rewarded after all his hardship, so Kyle is left thinking that the story is about God allowing a good man to suffer just to prove a point to the Devil.
</li><li> The whole of Season 20 was very muddled because of Donald Trump's unexpected victory that caused the episodes' scripts to be rewritten on the fly, so whatever they wanted to say about cyberbullying ended up to be confusing. Gerald as an internet troll causes a lot of mayhem including a suicide, but ultimately saves everyone by defeating a bigger troll who wanted to cause World War III and suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">no repercussions</a> whatsoever for what he's done. Said troll after the reveal has no personality or motivation outside of doing things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a> and as such is just a caricature. Meanwhile, the other cyberbullies that are portrayed in a more sympathetic way, i.e. lashing out at the world that always treated them as outcasts to hide their pain, are completely forgotten about once they are imprisoned in the TrollTrace headquarters and their motivations are never explored. In the end it's not clear what the show's stance on trolling and cyberbullying is, other than its usual point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode "Defenders of Peace" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> seemed to be all over the place with its moral. Half the time, the moral seems to be that it is wrong to try and force pacifists into a war, but the other half of the time, it seems to be saying pacifists are cowardly pussies and if war comes your way, you should pick a side, like it or not. The episode really had two protagonist groups who each learned a different lesson ("Don't drag other people into your problems" for the Jedi and "Once you've been dragged into a problem, ignoring it won't make it go away" for the pacifists). It's a problem shared by most non-propaganda war stories where the good guys need to look like heroes without glorifying war: ultimately, the moral comes down to "Fighting is bad; losing is worse."
</li><li> Parodied in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, where Robin argues that the moral is that too much TV is bad for you since the villain of the week used television to attack them. However Starfire points out that this can't be correct since Beast Boy's knowledge of TV conventions was the only thing that allowed the Titans to defeat said villain. This causes the other Titans to decide that there <em>wasn't</em> a moral, with Cyborg cheerfully declaring, "It was all completely meaningless." Ironically, the episode has a valid aesop about properly expressing one's love for their hobby: Both Control Freak and Beast Boy are knowledgeable in pop culture from watching TV, but BB uses his knowledge to help and save the day from the threat CF posed with his knowledge.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> special <em>Misty Island Rescue</em>. The film is supposedly about making good decisions... only the writers themselves can't seem to decide whether or not Thomas should make decisions and think for himself, and the other characters never seem to object to Thomas's stupid choices, making the whole thing quite vague. The nearest to an accurate evaluation is when the Locos suggest to Thomas to simply accept you'll make bad choices every once in a while (though since this was in reaction to a feat that almost got them lost in the middle of nowhere forever even that might not be the best evaluation).
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders">The Weekenders</a></em> episode opens with Tish distraught that her report card has a negative comment about her being too much of a perfectionist. Later, the other guys ask her to paint a seaweed statue for an auction. She paints the statue, saying, "It's not perfect, but it's good enough..." but then she decides that a different kind of seaweed would work better for the statue, and she ends up returning the statue unpainted because she didn't have time to paint the rebuilt statue. After the auction, Tish is disappointed at her perfectionism streak screwing up the job... and then one of the teachers buys up the statue. The ep ends with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">straightening up the shot</a> before the usual "Later days!" So... is perfectionism supposed to be good or not? It could be taken as saying not to get too hung up on being perfect, because the finished product is still good. That would be a better message to send than just "don't try too hard to be perfect," because some perfectionists try so hard because they think they'll outright fail otherwise. If Tish's statue hadn't sold, it would have confirmed that not being perfect made it a failure, but as it is, it shows that Tish still succeeded while managing to let it go.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WillasWildLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WillasWildLife">Willa's Wild Life</a></em> episode "Feathered Friends", the penguins Inky, Blinky, and Bob invite three penguin friends over for a party at their new place, a winter wonderland they created in the attic of Willa's house. These "friends" not only treat Willa and the other animals like non-entities, they invite over a large number of penguins that Inky, Blink, and Bob don't recognize and proceed to have a large party, excluding Inky, Blink, and Bob's other animal friends. It's not clear whether this was supposed to be an Aesop about being careful that some who call you friends may just be using you. There were additional elements of the Aesop about impressing others that are more interested in what you have than who you are (a phenomenon that continues to be prevalent in many society circles, and the guest penguins did have stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNewEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNewEngland">Hollywood New England</a> names like Smitty, Henry, and Boomton). Curiously, enough, Smitty, Henry, and Boomton remained silent during their time onscreen as did all of the other guest penguins. Inky, at least felt that because those so called "friends" were also penguins, they'd be cool with Willa and the rest of the gang. This suggests a not often taken approach on the issue of racism, where you find out that your old group of friends may not like your other group of friends because your new group of friends includes individuals of the wrong race. However, the guest penguins behavior towards Willa and the other animals wasn't so much hostile, but just snobbish and distant (at one point, a guest penguin treats Willa as if she were a servant giving her a fishbone to throw away without so much as acknowledging her). Inky's description of them as friends seems as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a>. This is a case where dialogue and character background from the guest penguins would have probably cleared things up.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> episode "Walk on the Wild Side" seems to start out with a "girl power" message, as the female mutants form a crime-fighting team after they get fed up of not being appreciated after Scott's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a> causes him to act like a shining knight and unthinkingly ruins the Aesop Jean was trying to teach Amara. Towards the ending, Cyclops and Nightcrawler decide to spy on the girls as they track down and confront a gang. The girls finally call it quits when a female police officer tells them that what they're doing is wrong... But after they leave, the policewoman turns out to be Mystique in disguise.
