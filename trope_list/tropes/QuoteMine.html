In the commercial, however, we hear that Bob has called the movie "[...] a great work of art[.]"
</p><p>The commercial has just quote mined.

Features commonly in sloppy rhetoric and propaganda pieces. Unfortunately, this usually works with an ill-informed audience, as the speaker can usually expect that they will not check the source for the quotes. Frequently used as part of an <em>ad hominem</em> fallacious argument.
</p><p>The act of quote mining is also referred to as 'quoting out of context.'

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    Advertising </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Advertisers commonly do this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolishTheTurd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolishTheTurd">hype critical acclaim for pretty much any product they want to sell</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisMiller">Dennis Miller</a> once noted that if he said, "Whoever made this movie should be put in a gas chamber", the ads would read, "... a gas! — Dennis Miller".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a>, in his scathing review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBoyScout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBoyScout">The Last Boy Scout</a></em>, said: "Perhaps propelled by the determination of its star, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis">Bruce Willis</a>, to erase the box-office curse of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HudsonHawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HudsonHawk">Hudson Hawk</a></em>, this film panders with such determination to the base instincts of the action crowd that it will, I am sure, be an enormous hit." Guess which three words the posters loudly declared Ebert saying? (Although he did it give a three-star "Good" rating.)
<ul><li> He also got quote mined for his review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GForce">G-Force</a></em> where he called the film "non-stop, wall-to wall madcap action." <em>G-Force</em> proudly presented this on their posters, ignoring that he was <em>criticizing</em> that aspect of the movie, not praising it, and that he actually gave the film 2 1/2 stars (mediocre).
</li><li> On the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">he was well aware of this trope</a>, as anybody who works in newspapers is, and actually called out advertisers preemptively who might do this for his review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DumbAndDumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DumbAndDumber">Dumb and Dumber</a></em> (where he wrote that he laughed himself silly at the parakeet scene, but didn't enjoy the rest of the movie).
</li><li> The marketing for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines">Terminator 3</a></em> mined Ebert's review — "'Terminator' is made in the spirit of these slick new action thrillers, and abandons its own tradition to provide wall-to-wall action in what is essentially one long chase and fight, punctuated by comic, campy or simplistic dialogue" — for the blurb, <em>"Wall-to-wall action!</em>" Ebert remarked wryly, "You have to admit 'wall-to-wall action' does accurately describe the film. So does my closing sentence: '...dumbed down for the multiplex hordes.'"
</li></ul></li><li> Another one, slightly more subtle: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnatomyOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnatomyOfHell">Anatomy of Hell</a></em> says on its poster that it was deemed "provocative" for its graphic sexual sequences, but leaves out any indication of whether the reviewer thought the provocation was a good thing.
</li><li> Discussed in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/theater/18ishe.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=isherwood%20review%20quote&amp;st=cse">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> It can be safely assumed that if a review blurb contains ellipses, what is being left out is less than complimentary. For instance, if a blurb says "This film is... an amazing achievement", you can bet that the full statement is something along the lines of "This film is so mind-numbingly stupid that getting anybody to go see it would be an amazing achievement."
</li><li> On the back of the box for <em>Rock of the Dead</em> is a quote from IGN: "Why didn't anyone think of this before?" The 5.0 out of 10 score that IGN gave the game is omitted.
</li><li> The <em>Sands Of Oblivion</em> DVD has the quote "'One of the most unique story ideas for any movie the Sci-Fi Channel ever produced' — Dread Central" The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/sands-oblivion-dvd">respective review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> gives it two "knives" out of five and laments on how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">wasted</a></em> said unique idea<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note03pw2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note03pw2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note03pw2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CecilBDeMille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CecilBDeMille">Cecil B.

</li><li> <em>The Lying Ape</em> brings up two instances of this happening to book reviewers. One reviewer was quoted as saying, "People will rush out and buy this book"; the full sentence had been, "Only crazy people will rush out and buy this book." Another gave a book a scathing review and made it clear he hated it, but as he was reviewing it in January, ironically tacked on at the end, "Best book I've read all year." Naturally, only the last line was quoted on the book cover.
</li><li> The <em>New York Post</em> has a regular column titled "Required Reading" which contains quick takes (a short paragraph in length) on various new books. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/books/required_reading_ProWV9crMIF8KDivudTU7I">One column included a mention<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the 2013 novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChristianNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChristianNation">Christian Nation</a></em>. On the novel's promotion page, they included the blurb "'Required reading...' —<em>New York Post</em>" (treating the name of the <em>column</em> as praise for the book).
</li></ul></li><li> Comedian Michael McIntyre admitted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou">Have I Got News for You</a></em> that he used to advertise his act as having received four stars, neglecting to clarify that that was the sum total of stars from all his reviews.
</li><li> Infamously bad shooter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana">Daikatana</a></em> featured a quote from <em>PC Zone</em> on an ad, reading "Absolutely brilliant" — these two words were taken from a preview which appeared years before the actual game (<em>PC Zone</em> actually gave the game 53% and a very negative review).
</li><li> This happened to one <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.today/usZt0#selection-449.15-449.24">EGM previewer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when he wrote a preview blurb about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bubsy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bubsy">Bubsy 3D</a></em> embarrassing him for many years. For those not in the know, Bubsy 3D is widely considered to be one of the worst games of all time and managed to kill Bubsy as a character- until 2017 when someone had the bright idea to bring him back.
</li><li> The song "Strut" sung by Sheena Easton is about how terrible it is for men to look at women as sex objects. ("Strut, pout, Put it out/That's what you want from women"). When the song was used in an advertisement for a health club in the United States, every second line was deleted, resulting in the song having the <em>exact opposite meaning</em> ("Strut, pout, Put it out/<em>(silence)</em>").
</li><li> Advertisements for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Collateral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Collateral">Collateral</a></em> quote a review as saying the film is "a knockout." The actual review says the film declines in quality toward the end, but says "the first two thirds is a knockout."
</li><li> Dr. Pepper once had its cans featuring American images and the Pledge of Allegiance quote "One nation...indivisible." While not originally used in the Pledge, the ellipsis are precisely where "under God" has been used for many years. On the other hand, those words have only been a part of the pledge since 1959; the rest of the pledge is considerably older.
</li><li> Done for laughs in a Chevy ad displayed at Universities. Certain words are in dramatically larger font than the rest, such that from a distance the poster reads "CHEAT ON YOUR EXAMS".
</li><li> Back in 2007 or so when Monster Cable introduced the now popular Beats by Dre headphones, they pulled a quote from an Engadget article <em>that wasn't even a review</em>. Needless to say, this caused a bit of backlash.
</li><li> Isaac Asimov was once asked to a review a scientific book. He quickly decided that it was pseudoscience, and also poorly written. When he declined to write a review, the authors asked if there were any errors in the book. Since he had barely read it, he politely answered that he had not found any. The cover blurb read ISAAC ASIMOV COULD FIND NO ERRORS!
</li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEB3HRwP6t0">this ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Kellogg's Caramel Nut Crunch Cereal, a stock-boy, Wally, at a shop unwittingly creates this effect for himself. A girl comes back to find him sitting around eating the cereal and tells him that he needs to get off his butt and stock it. However, because so much of what she's saying his drowned out by his crunching of the cereal, what he hears her say is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingLikeTotallyTeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingLikeTotallyTeen">I like</a> (<em>crunch crunch</em>) you, Wally. Like, I'm totally (<em>crunch crunch</em>) nuts (<em>crunch crunch</em>) about you."
</li><li> An Instagram promo for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>'s album <em>Lover</em> cited a review by <em>The Indepedent</em> writer Alexandra Pollard, who apparently called it "a brilliant album." Pollard's actual quote was, "There is a brilliant album among the 18 songs, if only it had been pruned a little," which Pollard <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/alexjpollard/status/1166615360562434050">pointed out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on Twitter.

<ul><li> In Turn 19 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> R2</em>, Schneizel pulls this on Lelouch with the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession">Sarcastic Confession</a> to Suzaku <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of deliberately geassing Euphie to kill the Japanese</span>. When using the recorded conversation as part of a case against Lelouch as Zero to the Black Knights, Schneizel cherry-picks the most incriminating words, leaving out the rest of the conversation including Suzaku noting that Lelouch had been lying. This, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with the help of some more cursory evidence presented by Villetta with the support of their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouDumb">Ohgi,</a> leads them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">jump straight to the conclusion that Lelouch can't be trusted and must be put down immediately.</a></span> Which isn't a bad conclusion, but they probably could have been a bit more patient.

<div class="indent">Twenty times in the course of my late reading, have I been upon the point of breaking out, This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it.!!!

</li><li> Documentarian filmmaker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore">Michael Moore</a> has been demonstrated to do this in quite a number of his films, particularly his more recent ones.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BowlingForColumbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BowlingForColumbine">Bowling for Columbine</a></em>, probably his most egregious example, did this quite blatantly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharltonHeston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharltonHeston">Charlton Heston</a>. Observant viewers noticed that his clothes changed during a <em>single speech</em>. They also cut his post-Columbine speech at the line "we're already here", making his point (that NRA members were part of the emergency personnel at the tragedy) sound more like a smarmy mockery of his anti-gun opponents.
</li><li> A Canadian documentary on Moore himself <em>Manufacturing Dissent</em> points up just how much of his films' impacts are derived from this sort of quote-mining and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2">Iron Man 2</a></em>, during the Senate subcommittee hearing, Senator Stern deliberately has Colonel Rhodes quote a section of his report on the Iron Man armor out of context.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouveGotMail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouveGotMail">You've Got Mail</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks">Joe Fox</a> represents a chain of bookstores, whose newest location is right next to the small indie shop owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegRyan">Kathleen Kelly</a>. Both are interviewed by the local TV news, but Fox's interview is edited down to the seemingly-standoffish line "I sell cheap books. Sue me." Fox, watching the broadcast, is not amused, and reads off a long list of all the positive things he said about his store. In that same TV news segment, Kelly repeats a sarcastic quip made by Fox in a previous discussion, but she strips out the sarcasm. Her stilted delivery suggests she's uncomfortable doing this, so it's easy for the audience to forgive her.

They don't tell us that he said in the same speech that there was no room at all for slaves in the South to be free and that it was necessary to provide 'an efficient fugitive slave law' to return to slavery fugitive slaves who believed there was room for us all to be free." It's true that Lincoln later rejected such views, but they generally omit that he'd ever held them.

Cain is apparently quite fond of that text, recognizes the Quote Mine for what it is, and is furious about it underneath the pleasant poker face he needs to keep up. Amberley Vail's footnote reveals that the latter half of the sentence changes the meaning completely, to mean essentially the opposite:
<div class="indent">"The full quotation ... runs 'The path of duty is often a stony one, made easier by thought for others.'"

His exact words are "I cant tell anyone anything about my building. If I prepared a hash of words to stuff into other peoples brains, it would be an insult to them and to me... I want to ask every man who is interested in this to go and see the building, to look at it and then to use the words of his own mind, if he cares to speak." This gets reported as "Mr. Roark, who seems to be a publicity hound, received reporters with an air of swaggering insolence and stated that the public mind was hash. He did not choose to talk, but he seemed well aware of the advertising angles in the situation. All he cared about, he explained, was to have his building seen by as many people as possible."

</li><li> One review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em> included the line "<em>Good Omens</em> is a direct descendant of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>,</em> a vastly overpraised book or radio program or industry or something that became quite popular in Britain a decade ago when it became apparent that Margaret Thatcher would be in office for some time and that laughs were going to be hard to come by." Despite the reviewer clearly intending it as a negative comparison, the publishers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">couldn't wait to put</a> "a direct descendant of <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>" on the cover of the next edition. And, like them or loathe them, it <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">a fair comparison</a>, so it's one of the less dishonest examples of the trope.
</li><li> On his blog, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeAbercrombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeAbercrombie">Joe Abercrombie</a> reviewed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALandFitForHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALandFitForHeroes">The Steel Remains</a></em>, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.joeabercrombie.com/2008/03/13/the-steel-remains/">discussed how publishers asked him to provide a tagline<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Abercrombie's tagline was, "Bold, brutal, and making no compromises  Morgan doesnt so much twist the cliches of fantasy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">as take an axe to them</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">Then set them on fire. Then put them out by pissing on them</a>. He correctly predicted that the publisher would remove the last part, which rather changes the meaning. Absent that part, the caption sounds like Abercrombie, identified with the "grimdark" fantasy subgenre, is praising a fellow practitioner. However, with that part, the caption reads more as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamningWithFaintPraise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamningWithFaintPraise">Damning With Faint Praise</a> and indicates Abercrombie's actual opinion (voiced in the review) which is more to the effect that Morgan's book was too grimdark even for him-.

But my second was that this would be a mistake. I am afraid that Mr. Greener, like certain humble field plants which die when transferred to richer soil, had better be left to bloom in vaudeville against a background of ventriloquists and lady bicycle riders." Harry tells the book's protagonist, Tod Hackett, that he took out an advertisement in <em>Variety</em> that reduced this quote to "... some producer should put Mr. Greener into a big revue..."
</li><li> A popular qoute/aphorism about vikings goes something like "A viking was once asked what he believed in and he responded: <em>I believe in nothing but my own strength</em>". That is an episode is from <em>Færeyinga Saga</em>. What most people leave out is that the conversation is between two vikings. And that the episode ends a pagan idol mysteriously letting go of a magic ring so it can be passed to the non-believer to give him protection.

At least, it will <em>now</em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">Stephen Colbert</a> is often accused of doing similar things in his interviews.

She goes on to point out that the Bible also says that we are not to judge. Guess which part of the quote gets printed. Kind of an example itself; the Bible says <em>everyone</em> is a sinner, and "judge not" is a commonly-mined quote itself; see the Real Life folder.
</li><li> The episode "The Illusion of Truth" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> featured a news report which did this, along with a whole bunch of other ghastly "journalistic" tricks, to cast the titular station in a very bad light (this happened after the newly authoritarian Earth government took over the news channel in question and turned it into an overt propaganda outlet).
<ul><li> Although given that the B5 staff knew this was probably going to happen, you'd think they would have refrained from giving the reporters ammunition like "no force in the universe can stop us" to work with. Sheridan claimed that they gave them little to work with, but he must not have been paying as much attention to his words as he thought.
</li><li> Sometimes they give them nothing and it's still abused. In another clip, alien Ambassador Londo is complaining to Sheridan about the climate control in his quarters while Sheridan smiles and nods. Londo concludes with "This is highly inappropriate, Captain." The news report narrates over everything but the last sentence with a bit about how Sheridan is now taking orders from aliens. And cuts off just midway through Sheridan's highly insulting (to Londo) rebuff.
</li><li> In another case, simply removing all audio and replacing it with a voiceover works. So a scene of Lennier, a Minbari, showing the reporter where the station's (mainly Human) homeless live and telling him about the social plans that Sheridan tries to use to help them, while Dr. Franklin rushes past helping a heart attack victim, turns into one in which the aliens are dominant over the Humans, and anyone who objects is sedated and taken away by Dr. Franklin to be experimented on. Plus, the fact that Delenn previously made herself a Human-Minbari hybrid is obvious evidence that they are hoping to make other hybrids using genetic alteration.

The incident in question was concerning a battle between the dromaeosaur <em>Deinonychus</em> and the sauropod <em>Sauroposeidon</em>, as well as twisting consultant Matt Wedel's words to make him say the old, disproven belief that sauropods had two brains, when he explicitly stated that the theory he <em>claimed</em> in the show was false.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>:
<ul><li> Psalm 14:1 says "The fool has said in his heart 'There is no God'". You often find it used in anti-atheist comments. Problem: the other half of the verse is "They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good." The word translated "fool" means someone with no morals, <em>not</em> that people are idiots for not believing in God.
<ul><li> For that matter, people will sometimes respond to creationist quote-mining (see below) by facetiously truncating this even further to, There is no God, thereby demonstrating the fallacy of quote mining to people who may not understand what is wrong with it, since obviously the Bible isnt ever arguing that God that does not exist.
</li></ul></li><li> Matthew 7:1-3. What people quote: "Judge not, lest ye be judged." What they mean: Stop telling me how to live my life based on your views.
<ul><li> Full quote: "Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?" Two original meanings: 1) The standards you judge others by are the standards that will be applied to you. 2) Don't be a hypocrite.
</li></ul></li><li> Christians who quote the "eye for an eye" doctrine laid out in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus">Exodus 20:22</a> are either conveniently forgetting or never learned the part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels">Gospel of Matthew</a> (specifically Matthew 5:38-40) where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> explicitly repudiated that passage (the "turn the other cheek" remark). See also "Vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord" (as in, <em>not yours</em>) in Deuteronomy 32:35 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRomans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRomans">Romans 12:19</a>, and also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfProverbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfProverbs">Proverbs 20:22</a>, which lays it out quite clearly:
<div class="indent">"Do not take vengeance against evil, but wait for the Lord and He will avenge you."
</div><ul><li> In other words, not so much repudiated as saying, "It isn't for you to exact yourself, but a judge. And you may be better off waiting for The Judge, i.e., God." Also, the repayment of an eye is not itself an eye, but the <em>value</em> of an eye.
</li></ul></li><li> For an "in-universe" example, Satan quotes passages from Scripture out of context during his temptation of Jesus. Jesus doesn't fall for it, and responds with other quotes that prove Satan wrong.
</li><li> One famous (mis)quote from the Bible is "Money is the root of all evil". The actual quote, from 1 Timothy 6:10 reads "For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows". So, the Bible isn't saying money in and of itself is wicked. It's greed that is evil, because it causes people to do evil things.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, many verses of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Qur'an</a></em> are often taken out of context or truncated. A good example is 5:32: "Whoever slays a soul, it is as though he slew all men; and whoever keeps it alive, it is as though he kept alive all men" is often brought to demonstrate how wrong the terrorists are. However, the full quotation is "For this reason [the murder of Abel] did We prescribe to <em>the children of Israel</em> that whoever slays a soul, <em>unless it be for manslaughter or for mischief in the land</em>, it is as though he slew all men; and whoever keeps it alive, it is as though he kept alive all men; and certainly Our messengers came to them with clear arguments, but even after that <em>many of them certainly act extravagantly in the land</em>." Not only is killing allowed as punishment for murder but also for those who commit "mischief in the land". And for the extremists, all misbelievers are committing mischief. They're also going by the older meaning of "mischief", which is far less light-hearted than what is meant today.

After the boys manage to free Chef from the mind control his dialog is still edited clips, but the quality is much better. This was in reference to Tray Parker and Matt Stone's belief that the Church of Scientology either forced Hayes to quit or else quit "for" him, since up to that point he'd never complained about the show's content.

Duchess Satine knows something is off with the recording based on what she knows of the representative's character, but can't prove it immediately due to his death. When she gets her hands on the original recording and has it presented through Padme (due to Satine being falsely accused of murdering her informant), it is shown that the representative was trying to make a case for why Mandalore <em>doesn't</em> need Republic intervention to deal with Death Watch.

<ul><li> Opponents of abortion and birth control sometimes combine a Quote Mine with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar">Hitler Ate Sugar</a>, attempting to "prove" that Planned Parenthood is racist because Margaret Sanger once said "We do not want word to get out that we are trying to exterminate the Negro population." The reason she didn't want that word to get out is that, well, that <em>wasn't</em> what she was trying to do in the first place. The quote was from a conversation with a popular minister in a black community and was about finding ways to extend her services to black women who wanted them <em>without</em> being suspected of specifically targeting a group of people for elimination. Many other people who wanted to provide birth control for African Americans wanted to do so to limit their population growth — when Sanger said that, she was saying that she didn't want people to think that because this time it wasn't true. The quote is used to accuse her of exactly what she was trying to <em>avoid</em> being accused of. It's true that she was (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">like most people then</a>) somewhat racist and supported eugenics (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">was more-or-less mainstream science back then</a>). Regardless of this, her own accounts say she had first advocated birth control after seeing women die from illegal abortions. Eugenics came later. It is simply an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssociationFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssociationFallacy">association fallacy</a> to use her views against the Planned Parenthood of today.
</li><li> This routinely happens in political campaigns, and candidates routinely accuse their opponents of doing this, whether or not they do. There's no way to make a 30-second commercial that gives all the context to any statement; if candidate A makes an ad about candidate B's gaffe, B is certain to say it was taken out of context.
<ul><li> One of the more infamous quote-mines to come out in the 2010 Congressional election was the Democratic candidate Alan Grayson portraying his Florida opponent as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime">Taliban Dan</a>" Webster, by showing (repeatedly in <em>one commercial</em>) Webster saying "She will submit to me" in reference to his wife... except he was talking about <em>not</em> picking and choosing biblical text to follow, using that as an example.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore">Al Gore</a> is commonly characterized by his opponents as a pompous self-aggrandizer, with the most common accusation being that he claimed to have invented the Internet.

In context, he's talking about his time as a senator when he championed and funded ARPANet, the government network that eventually became the internet.
</li></ul></li><li> After George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin, NBC News ran a piece with the 911 call from Zimmerman with a sound bite of him saying "He looks up to no good. He looks black". In actuality he said "he looks up to no good", says that was looking around alone in the rain, and only mentioned Martin's race when the 911 operator asked him "Is he white, black, or Hispanic?". NBC claimed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">this was unintentional, as if there was any way to accidentally delete specific audio from the middle of a police recording</a>.

</li><li> Afghan parliamentary representative Malalai Joya was removed from her office using this trick, after a television interview was cut to make it seem she had insulted the entire political body, when in reality she had simply ridiculed warlords among the officials.

</li><li> J.

In context, he makes it clear that the quote was in reference to doing your duty, even if it was unpleasant (this is more or less the whole point of the <em>Gita</em>; it's Krishna's quasi-pep talk to Arjuna in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mahabharata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a></em>, explaining that everyone has a role in the order of the Universe, and sometimes that role is the unpleasant business of killing loads of people for the good of everyone else). Actually, he was one of very few scientists who <em>didn't</em> think it was a mistake. When asked about deploying the bomb, a small council including Oppenheimer and Fermi asserted that it was required while the majority of the scientists disagreed. Those scientists weren't on that council.

Harper himself is noted by analysts as having won his position by means of his extremely tight control of the Conservative spin machine. The pot calling the kettle black?

</li><li> Attempted (failed) positive example: on the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial, a quote was mashed up into "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."

<ul><li> Apart from Number 10, which issued a statement saying: "Those who have made the regrettable decision to strike may be assured: Executions are not government policy."
</li></ul></li><li> Quote mining scientists is such a popular tactic of creationists that many prominent biologists deliberately word their lectures and publications in ways to make quote mining more difficult. Also, given that the people who initially carry out the quote mining know what they're saying is a deliberate misrepresentation, it's given rise to the Liars for Jesus meme.
<ul><li> A common tactic by creationists is to quote mine <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, specifically, the part where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDarwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDarwin">Charles Darwin</a> talks about how absurd it seems that the eye could have evolved. The quote mine is leaving out the second paragraph, wherein he explains exactly why eye evolution is perfectly reasonable. <br/><br/>The Quote Mine: "To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree." (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKFtNuGt4rw">Discussed here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) <br/><br/>The immediately following context: "Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound." <br/><br/>The broad strokes of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye">evolution of the eye<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are now widely understood, to the point where most of it is settled science. This particular quote mine is so infamous that even creationist sites like <em>Answers In Genesis</em> advise against using it.
</li><li> Similarly, a passage from <em>The Descent of Man</em> is often victim to this particular brand of cheating, with the words being spliced to make it seem as though Darwin is advocating the extermination of the disabled (he argued for them to be treated equally instead).
</li><li> The Creation museum in San Diego features a placard near the entrance on how science is compatible with religion, with a quote from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>: "I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist". Surprising that they resorted to quote mining for something as inconsequential as that, given the number of actual scientists they could have quoted legitimately, and given that Asimov's quote on the subject in full concluded with: "but I so strongly suspect that he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time."
</li></ul></li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FScottFitzgerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FScottFitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> was wrong when he wrote 'there are no second acts in American lives.'" No, anyone who uses that sentence is the one who's wrong. Fitzgerald didn't mean that Americans don't get second chances. He was talking about the classical three-act dramatic structure. He was saying that Americans are impatient and prefer to go straight from conflict (act 1) to resolution (act 3) without deliberation (act 2), which, as anyone who has ever met a New Yorker or LA resident can tell you, is true.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s opening line from <em>The Ballad of East and West</em>: "never the twain shall meet'' is often used to mean that two things or people are so different that they can never exist together or agree with each other. In fact Kipling meant the complete opposite, as the third and fourth lines say that while two geographic points of the compass will never meet, when two strong men meet, the accidents of birth or nationality or race do not matter at all, and the two men are equal. The entire poem is an argument against the idea.
</li><li> Too often used by New Agers against people who call them out. Not only will they take the words, they sometimes even change the pronouns to make it seem that the opponents are admitting to being unscrupulous. At others, they have inserted sentences that readers are supposed to believe were in the original. The differences in grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style are usually obvious to anyone without a vested interest in the doctrines.

However, this completely ignores everything else Ikeda said, including that he thought the overarching plot was more important than <em>any</em> romance, admitting that he can't write romance and calling it a personal fault, and saying that he could definitely see Heero and Relena getting together after the war had ended.

</div></li><li> FBI Director James Comey was fired based on a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein which does this heavily. Immediately after a reference to Comey's July 2016 press conference where he announced that he would not seek charges against Hillary Clinton, the memo quotes many former White House officials saying that Comey's "decision" was a mistake and showed bad judgment. Most of those people were not referring to that press conference, but to Comey's later decision to announce the finding of more e-mails, which was widely believed to sway voters away from Hillary in the final week of the campaign. That was the official reason, anyway. According to Comey he was fired for unrelated reasons and the whole affair is now the subject of multiple official inquiries.

The full quote runs: "The Penguin books are splendid value for sixpence, so splendid that if other publishers had any sense they would combine against them and suppress them." In other words, it was an ironic comment <em>supporting</em> the paperback format, not opposing it. The irony of twisting Orwell's words around in a similar way to the Ministry of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doublespeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doublespeak">Truth</a> in his novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">1984</a></em> was pointed out not only by the estate, but by anyone even remotely familiar with him.

</div></li><li> Due to the rather divisive opinions about him in the west, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a> is probably second only to Jesus Christ for most quote-mined man in history:
<ul><li> Some communists recite the bare bones of the "historical materialist" theory like it's divine gospel, while anti-Marxists deride it as a cult-like belief system. Marx, however, considered it merely a guideline for European historical analysis, nothing more. He rejected teleological interpretations and especially warned against exporting it to under-industrialized countries that couldn't sustain it, though he wrote that in the third part of the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, "Socialist and Communist Literature", and after the hot spicy bourgeois-on-proletariat action of the first two chapters, everybody's too worn out to read what sounds like a book review.
</li><li> The infamous "opium of the masses" quote is often used as a justification to abolish religion by force. Whereas in its original context, it meant that the cruelty of the world fueled the desire for the hope religion offers, and that if that cruelty is removed, religion will gradually fade away of its own accord. It's also relevant that opioids were used medicinally at the time, and still are: it could be interpreted to mean that religion is necessary in small doses as, effectively, pain relief, but if overdosed or abused, it can wreak havoc.
</li><li> "Abolition of the family!" is a line from the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> that is often quoted out of context as proof of an anti-family agenda, whereas it's actually a paraphrase of his critics. He and Engels go on to say they are against the family as an economic relationship for private gain, not that they want to take everybody's kids away (except for a little thing we now call "public education").
</li><li> His invectives against private property are often quote-mined to "prove" that he wanted to take away everything that you personally own (or, in the case of some communist regimes, that everything you own <strong>should</strong> be taken away). What isn't quoted is the part of the "Communist Manifesto" wherein he and Engels explain that private property refers only to the means of production, i.e. factories, and that they fully support people personally owning the products of those factories.
</li><li> "Dictatorship of the proletariat" is often taken to mean a literal dictatorship by a Communist party, but in <em>The Civil War in France</em> it's explained as merely an armed militia of the working class who very clearly express their wishes to their elected officials (which Marx was in favor of), not dissimilar to the idea behind the Second Amendment in the United States.
</li></ul></li><li> A very common quote mine specific to Germany is to use Ernst Reuter's supposed quote (translated): "People of the world, look at this city[...]." and showing some random achievement and shots of Berlin for the propaganda...ahem, documentary purpose of supporting whatever supposedly positive thing the Western powers did after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. The full quote goes: "People of the world, look at this city and realize that you cannot and must not sell out this city and this people", which was criticizing plans of whatever was supposed to happen to Germany and Berlin in particular, as one such plan involved turning Germany into de-industrialized grasslands.
</li><li> Writer A.A. Dowd details his experience being quote mined in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.avclub.com/article/no-i-didnt-call-your-shitty-movie-comedic-masterst-221227">this editorial.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The back of the Canadian DVD for <em>Accidental Love</em> quotes him saying that the film is "A comedic masterstroke." The actual quote in context from his C- review was: "To be fair to whoever refashioned <em>Accidental Love</em> from the abandoned scraps of <em>Nailed</em>, theres little reason to believe that the ideal, untroubled version of the material would have been a comedic masterstroke." The editorial also goes into detail in examining how taking snippets from negative reviews and re-purposing them as an endorsement hurts everyone involved - if someone takes the mined quote at face value and watches a movie they end up thinking is terrible on the reviewer's "recommendation", they'll stop trusting that reviewer, who in turn won't be able to get those people to go watch films they <em>actually</em> endorse, thus leading to those films making less money.
</li><li> A promotional poster for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legend2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legend2015">Legend (2015)</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/benfraserlee/status/641368752798306304">managed to do this with a star rating<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: The poster depicts its stars, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHardy">Tom Hardy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo">and Tom Hardy</a>, standing in front of positive ratings for the movie...but apparently they couldn't <em>quite</em> find enough four- or five-star ratings to make the effect symmetrical enough, so they slipped in a two-star review from <em>The Guardian</em> by positioning it in such a way that it looked like 4 or 5 stars partially blocked by the two Hardys in the foreground. The reviewer remarked, "Incredible way of making my two-star review seem like I didn't hate the film."
</li><li> In 2015, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron">David Cameron</a> (and previously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">The Sun</a>) attempted to discredit the left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn by claiming that he had said that the death of Osama Bin Laden was "a tragedy". The actual tragedy that Corbyn had been referring to was that Bin Laden was assassinated instead of being captured and put on trial. The Prime Minister was widely ridiculed when the truth came to light. For a time it even became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">a minor meme</a> to attribute the quote "The death of Osama Bin Laden was a tragedy" to Cameron.
<ul><li> This is a very common tactic for The Sun, in fact, usually extending to whatever person they feel like discrediting. Jeremy Corbyn is a frequent target (one example was him saying how he would never go to war, with the quotes omitting the minor prefix of <em>in an ideal world...</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> Quote mining is a fairly common tactic for Fundamentalist Christians when they claim that things like books and games are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsSatanInHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsSatanInHell">Satanic and trying to turn your kids evil.</a> Usually, this is done by taking something the villain said or did, ignoring the fact that they are the <em>villain</em>, and then claiming that the work is promoting the villain's philosophy rather than condemning it. Just goes to show how much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">research</a> they bother do before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">demonizing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll">whatever happens to be popular.</a>
<ul><li> Quote-mining Scripture itself to suit a particular pet doctrine tends to be a thing among Christian pastors and teachers, which goes back to the original Quote Miner himself Satan, when he twisted a few verses in Psalm 91 in order to tempt Jesus into jumping off the high point of the Temple.
</li></ul></li><li> This is key to an alleged (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/can-you-hear-me-scam/">there's no evidence it's ever been done successfully<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) phone-scamming tactic in which a caller simply asks if you can hear them and if you say "yes", they record that, splice it with a recording of something else, and pretend that you used it to authorize a charge or something. Of course, for this to work it would require a company dumb enough to allow a person to buy something with nothing more than the word "yes" but smart enough to establish a <em>voiceprint database</em> with which to match that word "yes" (because if they didn't have such a database, there wouldn't be any need to actually record the victim rather than just impersonate them).
</li><li> It's so common that it's become a cliche to cite the lines of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">Martin Luther King Jr's</a> <em>I Have a Dream</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/i-have-a-dream">speech,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which he imagines a truly equal future after all of the injustices and systemic abuses he was fighting against and calls out in the speech itself had been corrected, as if it was not only the entire speech but his entire career and also that it represented America as it exists now. Specifically, it gets reduced to "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character". Thus, every time somebody speaks up about any kind of civil rights issue, somebody on the other side will use that snippet to claim that even suggesting that something was racially motivated, ever, especially if it disproportionately affects black people, is a betrayal of King because they raised the topic at all.
<ul><li> Another frequently cited quote of Martin Luther King is when he said "Riots are the language of the unheard", using it as proof that he supported riots. The whole speech is actually about how riots are evidence of social unrest and unhappiness and as such, they are understandable, but at the same time they are self-defeating and socially destructive and he always stood for non-violent protests.
</li></ul></li><li> It's unfortunately pretty common for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">scummy prosecutors</a> to use this tactic to make someone look guilty. For example, if someone is accused of murdering someone they might take some quote that was obviously a joke or exaggerating (e.g. "if you forgot my coffee, I'm gonna kill you") as "evidence" that the person wanted to kill the victim.
