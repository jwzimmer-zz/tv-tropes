</p><p>Well, it turns out the majority of the viewers don't believe that the ending is happy.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">The director claims</a> that the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FiveCentimetersPerSecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FiveCentimetersPerSecond">5 Centimeters per Second</a></em> is supposed to be uplifting, because Takaki smiles as he walks away in the last scene, indicating that he has moved on. But most viewers see it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotGetTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotGetTheGirl">Did Not Get the Girl</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AfterSchoolNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AfterSchoolNightmare">After School Nightmare</a></em>. The entire series was taking place in the minds of the unborn babies in a maternity ward. The babies are all born safely, but they grow up knowing nothing about anything that occurred in the series. A scene at the very end shows Mashiro and Sou running into each other and having no idea who the other is, pointlessly teasing readers about possibilities that will never be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em>: The trope qualifies at least for Slaine. At the end of the show, he is left to rot in prison after being accused of plotting to kill Princess Asseylum <em>by Princess Asseylum herself</em>. In reality, all this time he attempted to protect Asseylum, who only incarcerated him out of political necessity. The writers said his ending is supposed to be a happy one because he is no longer obligated to serve Asseylum. Ironically, his original fate was scrapped for being even more depressing; but even his haters thought the revised ending was still too harsh.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArmedGirlsMachiavellism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArmedGirlsMachiavellism">Armed Girl's Machiavellism</a></em>: The anime adaptation ends with Nomura beating Amou, who gets expelled from Aichi Academy for causing trouble, but still manages to make peace with her. All's well and good... except for the fact that Amou still declares Nomura to be hers and hers alone, not to mention she never really shows any remorse for her sociopathic behavior. Furthermore, it's implied she didn't actually learn anything from her experiences in Aichi Academy and will continue causing trouble elsewhere, and yet we're expected to believe her love for Nomura has redeemed her somewhat. Not to mention, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">getting out of the effective captivity the school had forced her into was her entire reason for going on such a rampage in the first place.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol">Aquarion Evol</a></em> aimed for an ending that, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Kawamori's words</a>, wouldn't leave a bad taste in the mouth. But in the viewers' eyes, it looks rather upsetting. After Fudo was revealed to be Apollonius all along, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">it makes it very clear that he's responsible for everything that has happened in the show, and that he has been manipulating everyone to solve the problems he himself started</a>, and in the end he gets free from punishment, shoving all the responsibility on Mykage instead. Nobody, except Crea, knows about this. The love triangle also seems to end on a rather troublesome note: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">Kagura's character was completely changed at the last minute to give up Mikono</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds">start caring about Zessica instead</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare">Zessica is shown to be completely broken at the end</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic">Mikono</a> wasn't even allowed to choose who he liked more, since Kagura decided he actually supported Amata's love. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">And Zessica can't ever hope to be with Amata, not even in a future reincarnation, since she wasn't even allowed to make a 12,000 years promise.</a> They're all smiling in the end, but the viewers can't say the same...
</li><li> At the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> manga, Soria, Rishar, and King Zak are left to transition Asran from a monarchy to a modern republic. While Asran's civil war is over and the people are jubilant, Asran's future is far from secure. First, the country's infrastructure and finances have been devastated by years of war. Second, the civil war has probably left Asran's people with deep resentment toward each other. Finally, the whole mess has been inherited by a conservative monarch, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide-Eyed Idealist</a>, and an amnesiac who spent the previous two decades in cryogenic suspension. Suddenly, Asran's future doesn't look so bright. Also at the end of the manga, Ryoko reunites with Shin. Shin suffers from amnesia due to head trauma and does not remember his time at Area 88. On the surface, this appears to be a happy romantic reunion, until you realize that Ryoko will need to explain to Shin why he's in Asran and why years of his memory are missing. To boot, Shin will undoubtedly suffer from unconscious war trauma, even if he can't remember Area 88. Finally, Shin broke Ryoko's heart several times throughout the manga, suggesting that he has cold tendencies. In short, Ryoko has chosen to marry a traumatized, amnesiac jerk, raising questions about what their life together will be life.
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arisa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Arisa">Arisa</a></em> is played as fully happy, with Tsubasa reconciling with Arisa and their mother and Arisa finding true love with Midori. This ignores that Midori was an ax-crazy killer who manipulated everyone, <em>including</em> Arisa, and she doesn't seem to have learned anything from the experience.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BirdyTheMighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BirdyTheMighty">Birdy the Mighty</a>: Decode</em>. At the end of season 1, the Roppongi area of Tokyo gets completely trashed by a combination of the ryunka and the sanctum sanctorum Killsat used to attack it. However, season 2 is mostly about how these events affected people, including the survivors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodCTheLastDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodCTheLastDark">Blood-C: The Last Dark</a></em> ends with Saya finally getting her revenge after all the crap that she experienced in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC">TV series</a>. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengeanceFeelsEmpty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengeanceFeelsEmpty">what's the worth of it</a> when she found out that Fumito, the man who tormented her emotionally and psychologically, killed many people in the TV series and turned Mana's dad into an Elder Bairn, happens to be obsessively in love with her and all that he did is for her own survival and to fulfill her desire to feed on humans which he already failed? And considering that one of the people who helped her get to Fumito happens to be in league with him all along, Saya would probably experience more trust issues and never touch a coffee mug again. She can't even go back to Mana after she found out that she killed her dad at the beginning of the movie. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> at the end of the movie just shows that Saya would end up alone because she might not ever trust people again and end up hurting them if she does.
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueGender">Blue Gender</a></em> could only be considered happy if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">you're a severe technophobe</a>. A few humans have survived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance">Gaia's Vengeance</a>, and they can all live in harmony with mother nature, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight">free at last of technology</a>! Then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> sets in - the only survivors will be physically strong people. If you're a person who is crippled, blind, deaf, has a curable terminal disease, etc. then you're hosed. Mother Nature hates you and you have no right to live. And those well-meaning humans who were trying to save the planet by living in a space station (to ease the strain placed on Earth) and eliminating the hostile creatures that had infested Earth? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Screw them</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Earth survives the ordeal in one piece and humanity is relatively safe, which when compared to what happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru">Narutaru</a></em> is a positive cause for celebration. All the main characters died, thousands of Japanese died, some 33 thousand other universes and Earths were destroyed, and the game goes on with a new set of players as if nothing has happened... Yay?
</li><li> One example of the backlash was the anime's director. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a> went on to brighten things slightly: While <em>most</em> of the above still happens, one of the main characters survives and the last pilot breaks the game and makes sure it cannot be repeated elsewhere. Some fans think this change was a welcome improvement over the manga, while others disagree.
</li><li> The concept gets discussed in the manga, when Kirie wonders why people would consider a movie in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheLeadsGetAHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheLeadsGetAHappyEnding">many people die but the main characters get what they want</a> as having a happy ending.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series ends with an uplifting ending showing all the surviving characters smiling, despite the bittersweet nature of the preceding events and Lelouch's death, which is enough to make certain fans consider the whole thing a tragedy. The ending also leaves open what will happen to the world during the subsequent reconstruction phase. It is possible for viewers to speculate about how all the resulting death and destruction would have affected the social and economic structures of Japan, which may paint a rather pessimistic picture of this fictional world's future when all is said and done. The main culprit of this seems to be Okouchi and Taniguchi letting some of the staff throw out suggestions which caused a few of the visuals to be a little too happy, with one specific scene being borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">Tastes Like Diabetes</a> (the wedding photo) while the narration points out how there is still a lot of rebuilding to be done which we never actually see.
</li><li> Another aspect that is open to debate is how Lelouch first had to reach the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> following the Black Knights' mutiny and Nunnally's supposed demise. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">For Want of a Nail</a>, Lelouch may well have gone with a less destructive and suicidal method. In addition, a few of the Britannian survivors had committed murderous acts in the series while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingInstigatorOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingInstigatorOfDoom">the two specific people responsible</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">aforementioned hasty betrayal</a> also got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding">Happy Ending</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">though it's implied they might be making it up to Nunnally for it</a>). Lelouch himself admittedly saw beyond such concerns and recognized that everyone had to move toward the future together regardless of the past, but some viewers found the methods and results at least partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">self-contradicting</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>HOO-BOY</em> does <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> <em>Side Hope</em> end with one of these. The Final Killing Game, which pitted all the leaders of the Future Foundation against one-another, wasn't actually caused by the remnants of despair, but by <em>one of their own</em> trying to weed out the despair he believed was hiding among their group and to convince Ryota Mitarai to use his brainwashing video to spread hope to this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashingForTheGreaterGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashingForTheGreaterGood">by force</a>. Second, we learn that Class 77 was brainwashed into becoming the Remnants of Despair against their will. When they're all restored to live by Hajime, they arrive in time to stop Ryota and choose to take the blame for the killing game, then go to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Jabberwock island. Makoto and his friends survive, the Tragedy ends, and Hope's Peak is rebuilt with Makoto as headmaster. So a bunch of kids who were brainwashed into becoming murderous terrorists will now forever spend their lives as pariahs so the truth of the Future Foundation's corrupt leader will remain concealed, while the survivors of Class 78 rebuild the school that caused this entire situation for some reason. Oh, and all the other branch heads die save for Munakata. He'd found out that his girlfriend had been a despair for years and will never know how or why, his best friend (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredClosetGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredClosetGay">who was secretly in love with him</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificed his own life to end the game</a> even after Munakata tried to kill him, and everything he thought he was fighting for was pointless.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNA2">DNA2</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Mori</a>'s elaborate plan of using DNA Manipulation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> to create his personal, mind controlled and telekinetically strong army to declare war on the entire world thwarted. Mori is killed, but this comes at the cost of Junta overcoming the Mega Playboy DNA within him, meaning the playboy never awakened, so his descendants that had the playboy's DNA all cease to exist. Which <em>also</em> included the son Junta and Karin were going to have. And ultimately, Karin shoots Junta with a DMC one final time to fully remove the playboy DNA aspects, and the memories of her and the entire adventure, from him and returns to the future. There is the one bright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a> that Junta and Ami <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriousChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriousChildhoodFriend">will get together</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> appears to end with the villain (and his fanboy successor) dying and the world returning to normal. Until that final scene revealing that a happy-go-lucky Shinigami was the sponsor for the fake Kira three years later, he liked the experiment, and he has an arsenal of Death Notes just waiting for new owners. How did he get them? He bought them from the Shinigami King, who has no problem with selling each Death Note for 7 apples, and has not made any laws against this tourist trend. Which now means that Ryuk and hundreds of Shinigami will be sponsoring hundreds of nonviolent sniping killers, each with their own ideals and agendas, all of whom will inevitably duel and war with each other unless something goes horribly wrong. This is considered a fitting end to this dark series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> seemingly ends on a happy note  bad guy is dead for good, the Chosen Children get to keep their Digimon, even Oikawa gets redeemed in the end. But what many overlook is that the ending says every human on earth gained their own partner Digimon, which leads to all kinds of disturbing implications. Just imagine how much damage a Digimon could do in the hands of a criminal or a dictator.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>: The ending of Future Trunks arc is supposed to be seen as a bittersweet happy ending with them successfully defeating Merged Zamasu with Whis helping both Future Trunks and Future Mai have a bright future ahead of them by creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline">Close-Enough Timeline</a> just for them. However, it still doesn't change the fact that everyone they knew and loved from their original timeline got erased from existence and Trunks wasn't able to protect them in the end because right after Future Trunks destroyed Zamasu's physical body, his soul became a bodiless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that wipes out all the remaining survivors left on Earth and is in the process of spreading across the universe and timelines, forcing them to summon Zeno just to stop him but at the cost of the entire timeline. In other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">Zamasu had won</a> and the heroes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureHero">completely failed their goal of stopping him</a>, even to the point of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> for some fans. What mitigates this is that Whis <em>does</em> warn an AU version of himself about Zamasu, and thus there's now a <em>new</em> future for Trunks in which Zamasu doesn't get far.
</li><li> The anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em> ends rather positively, because it adds a new ending before the manga crosses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>. Subsequently, the manga's ending is iffy - the Diclonii will be completely eliminated within a generation. Their powers are too dangerous to allow them to continue to exist, but they're not all bad people, and their extermination is at <em>best</em> a necessary evil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO">Eureka Seven AO</a></em> tries to play its ending off as a happy one, but just a little bit of thinking reveals that its anything but. To clarify: The now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">written-out-of-history</a> Scub Corals were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a>, rendering the whole point of the first series meaningless. High-density Trapars are apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">fatal</a> to Human/Coralian hybrids, meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Ao</a> can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">never return to his real home or see his parents again</a> (his ultimate goal was to reunite with his mother). To top it off, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">messing with space-time</a> may well have written him out of the memories of everyone he knew or cared about. Yet the ending wants us to believe he's perfectly fine with all this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em> implies that Naota moves on with his life, but Amarao's entire story is foreshadowing: he fell in love with Haruko at a young age and she eventually abandoned him. Amarao tries to warn Naota but Naota ultimately chooses Haruko, who then predictably abandons him. Naota's subsequent reaction to Ninamori ordering the carbonated drink shows that he hasn't changed or matured as a character; the emphasis on Haruko's guitar in his room reinforces this fact. Naota is going to spend the rest of his life pining for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneThatGotAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneThatGotAway">The One That Got Away</a> just like Amarao.
</li><li> This trope is the main reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">the concluding movie</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> (2003) was so controversial. The bad guys are dead and the Elric brothers are finally reunited and their bodies restored... but in order to prevent an invasion of Amestris by the Nazis, the brothers are forced to permanently seal the Gate of Alchemy from Earth's side, trapping them there, alone, for the rest of their lives, however long <em>those</em> might be since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> is right around the corner and the movie made it <em>very</em> clear this isn't an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> isn't around. This seems to be an attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">bittersweet</a> that went too far into the "bitter" ballpark for much of the fanbase's liking.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenmaWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenmaWars">Genma Wars</a></em> ends on a supposedly uplifting note as Earth is freed from demons who have enslaved mankind for ages and civilization is stated to eventually rebuild itself. With that said, the leads attempt to travel back in time to prevent the demons from taking over Earth in the distant past, only to <strong>utterly fail in their mission</strong>. To make matters worse, they return to their own timeline where nothing really changed despite their efforts, most named characters (including their loved ones) have died over the course of the series and stayed dead. Also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> responsible for influencing all events in the series isn't really destroyed by the heroes with his survival being ambiguous at really best. The only reason his victory isn't absolute is because the twins refuse to turn against each other and become his puppets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellstarRemina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellstarRemina">Hellstar Remina</a></em> ends with Earth being devoured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> Remina. And after being chased literally all around the world by a group of deranged cultists and seeing her father and love interest get murdered, the human girl Remina, her hobo friend, and a kind family of survivors get lucky enough to reach a fallout shelter and <em>survive on a chunk of Earth that flies out of Remina's mouth with said shelter inside.</em> So they're saved! The problem is they only have about a year's worth of supplies. And they're left drifting in space with humanity, Earth, and most of the solar system gone. Assuming Remina eats the sun like it did in other systems, then they'll be adrift in interstellar space, with no hope of rescue or chance of even landing on another planet. Not like they could survive anyway. Although, considering how ridiculously lucky they've been so far, who knows what could be out there and what could happen during that year. By Junji Ito's usual standards, it's downright <em>saccharine.</em>
</li><li> Many people were dissatisfied with the ending of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick">Hot Gimmick</a></em> manga. While it was obvious that Hatsumi was going to end up with Ryoki, some readers held on to the hope that there would at least be enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> to give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Hatsumi</a> a backbone or make Ryoki less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, but the general consensus is that there was little if any sign of any of that ever coming to pass. It didn't help that Azusa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> was negated at the end thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a> and that Shinogu, suffered from a blatant case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds">Cleaning Up Romantic Loose Ends</a>. In fact, about the only thing most readers liked about the ending were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">Subaru/Akane</a> bits.
</li><li> An example exclusive to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse">Madhouse</a> anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>: Gon meets with Ging on the top of the tallest tree on the land, only for Ging to tell him that the tree they're on, is actually a small sprout from the Dark Continent much larger than their own homeland and all of it is taken to be very optimistic and exciting. Now it makes sense in the manga because it's the start of a new arc that will eventually succumb to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a>, but the anime ending implies this will lead to an idealistic adventure. And that's ignoring the unresolved plot threads the anime has. It is unknown if the anime will ever continue considering the Madhouse's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">track record</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">frequent and long hiatuses from the manga</a>.
</li><li> The ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetSunshine">Jewelpet Sunshine</a></em> has the human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> permanently turn into a Jewelpet so he can be with the Jewelpet protagonist forever. Meanwhile, the plot neglects to address the feelings of his parents and sister about this decision, not to mention he disappears for 5 years without telling anyone so he can turn into a Jewelpet.
</li><li> The anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano">Kare Kano</a></em>. Hinting that the official couple will break up sooner or later, and that it's OK, is a "happy ending" for Hideki Anno. Thankfully averted in the manga.
</li><li> In-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KillMeBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KillMeBaby">Kill Me Baby</a></em>: Yasuna has a dream where Sonya is the eponymous protagonist of Killtaro, who is out to slay an oni. Upon reaching the island of her destination, she takes a peach from a tree, and is called out by the villagers, who then chant "Ogre! Ogre!" We then have a discretion shot where she supposedly kills them, and then the narrator says "Such a happy ending..." Sonya then retorts "That wasn't happy at all!".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KoiZora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KoiZora">Koi Zora</a></em> ends with Hiro succumbing to his cancer and dies, causing Mika to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">suffer</a> and once again try to kill herself. She's stopped by her friends who show her Hiro's diary notes, which gives Mika the courage to live on and she learns that she is pregnant with Hiro's child. But the questionable happiness comes from the fact that Mika is not properly established as having a stable home life, job and her emotional instability, which has caused her to attempt suicide twice over the course of the series, is also a big issue. It makes one wonder whether she would be able to take care of the child, especially on her own.
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KumaMikoGirlMeetsBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KumaMikoGirlMeetsBear">Kuma Miko: Girl Meets Bear</a></em> is unanimously seen as this trope by fans. The character Machi is a teenage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">miko</a> from a small village with social anxiety who dreams of moving to the big city, and spends much of the show becoming familiar with modern tech in order facilitate this. When she finally gets to go in the final episode, she has to do a performance in front of a large crowd visiting the city. She successfully does the performance by going to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyPlace">Happy Place</a>, but that's when the entire story goes off the rails. She ends up hallucinating that the cheering crowd is actually throwing rocks at her, causing her to completely break down, terrified of the city and declaring she will never return. Rather than correct her delusions and get her help, her friends Natsu and Yoshio happily celebrate her decision. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Then it gets worse</a>, with Natsu telling Machi in this fragile state that she never has to think about anything ever again; the final scene is Machi having mentally regressing into a toddler, now more ignorant about the outside world and dependent on Natsu then ever before. All this while cheerful music plays.

Delta Squadron has liberated the Brisingr cluster and Hayate and Freyja get their happy ending, but the Windemereans make it clear the war is not over and the death toll numbers in the millions. Also, poor Mirage got her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confession</a> rejected...
</li><li> For the Windemereans case, their future doesnt look bright for them. Though Heinz is willing to establish peace talks, at the same time, he wants the UN Government to pay for their sins, which might not go very well, as his kingdom will suffer a lot of backlash from the intergalactic community for their actions. Likewise, Heinz is slowly dying after his singing affected his health, and his brother, who is the strongest pilot in the air force, hass already died, which not only leaves the Aerial Knights in a vulnerable position, but also leaves no successors to take leadership of Windermere once Heinz kicks the bucket.
</li><li> Not to mention, the issue of Windemereans having a significantly shorter lifespan than other species is never resolved, meaning that despite coming out on top of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>, Freyja is still doomed to die long before Hayate does.

While the ending is portrayed as positive with Gjallarhorn being reformed to be more democratic and granting Martian independence, it still doesn't change the fact that the new Gjallahorn is still run by the old regime with little to stop them from continuing their corruption.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ciej');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ciej" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ciej');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course, they <em>technically</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">won the final battle of the war</a>, but had to make some concessions to keep their spoils.</span>

<ul><li> Played with in the case of Sakura Haruno. Her ending sees her married to her longtime crush Sasuke Uchiha and having a daughter, Sarada. Great! Except for the fact that in the intervening years after Sasuke had pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, he succumbed to the Curse of Hatred that plagued the Uchiha clan for generations, attacked Sakura both physically and psychologically on several occasions, and tried to murder her friends. But after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">turning Face again</a>, he develops genuine affection for her and marries her in his travels around the world. At one point, Sakura becomes pregnant with their daughter, Sarada. After she gives birth at one of Orochimaru's hideouts, they return in Konoha to raise their daughter together. Unfortunately, he had to leave again to investigate Kaguya, while Sarada was very young. Sakura has no other choice but to raise Sarada alone. Years pass, which means that Sakura doesn't see Sasuke for many years, and he is away from seeing his daughter growing up. In time, Sarada grows conflicted about Sasuke and distrustful of her own mother, after being kept in the dark for her own safety for too many years. Most fans believe that this was another unnecessary drama, and that Kishimoto could have just make Sasuke leaving from time to time, as him being parted from his family for so long didn't affected the plot in the long run. The fact that Kishimoto created this storyline as a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">to troll</a> the people who couldn't comprehend that Sarada was Sasuke and Sakura's daughter, didn't calm things, making Sasusaku divisive even among their shippers.

It sees every human put through a death of the ego and their bodies dissolved, but Shinji gives them the chance to live again if they have the will (on a world wrecked by at least two disasters on a planetary scale). Ultimately, Shinji learns to accept himself and search for happiness, yet understanding that suffering is unavoidable in life; while some find this reassurance of hope even in the face of the apocalypse uplifting, others inevitably find it difficult to accept. Likewise, he and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedheads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedheads">red-head</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> spent the whole series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">being unable to realize</a> each other's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt">blatantly obvious</a> feelings, and the final scene hints that Shinji and Asuka at last have made a connection and may start to open up to each other.

The villain received no punishment whatsoever and in the end got what she wanted. Most of the fictional characters that came to the real world accomplished nothing and/or died, those who lived in the end still went back to their stories, subjected to their authors' whims, and the authors whose Creations died in the final battle are explicitly shown to be permanently traumatized by the tragedy.. Oh, and there's still a crazy murderer on the loose in the real world. Hooray?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RomeoXJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RomeoXJuliet">Romeo X Juliet</a></em> ends with most of the cast living happily ever after...all because Romeo and Juliet were horribly killed and sacrificed to a tree which had previously kept the city they live in afloat in the sky. What's worse, the show makes it very clear that none of this was Juliet's choice, but that <em>every single woman born to the Capulet line</em> had been sacrificed to this very same tree, meaning that she could have never reclaimed her throne (something the series had been building up to since the beginning) or ruled Neo Verona even if she wanted to.
</li><li> Done deliberately with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano">Saikano</a></em>, which sees the main character and his girlfriend as the last living beings from Earth, drifting through space, said girlfriend now completely inhuman with no hope of ever turning back. This is played as being as happy as they can wish for given the situation. The author's notes at the end of the manga even admit that all hope is gone, "but there are memories, and maybe a future".

</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryOneHundredPercent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryOneHundredPercent">Strawberry 100%</a></em> was meant by the author to be a way to happily resolve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> and leave all parties happy. However, it ended up as a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> and caused a gigantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a>, as Tsukasa's "loved him before he knew me" revelation was retconned in very late in the story with no hint that it ever existed beforehand, and Aya's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> of her story being about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichSuitorPoorSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichSuitorPoorSuitor">peasant girl vs a princess for the love of the prince</a> was seen by many as an obvious foreshadowing of her inevitable triumph for Junpei's affections. Instead of being an example of an underdog winning through compatible personalities and friendship as a base for romance, the ending simply reaffirmed the real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>-view of "pretty, popular girls win over girl-next-doors".

And the Spiral Nemesis, the thing the Anti-Spiral were trying to stop from happening is still a potential risk that has a very real chance of transpiring and destroying everything. For such an idealistic series, the ending can be especially jarring.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em> ends with a happy note as while Syaoran is cursed to travel endlessly across dimensions he believes he will see his love Sakura again. However, the fact that time flows differently in other worlds means that if it takes him a year to return to Clow Country, Sakura could already be dead when he returns. Furthermore, the villain who cursed Syaoran, Fei Wang Reed, was revealed to an artificial being before his death. Despite dying, it has been stated that artificial beings can be reconstructed so it is possible that he will be back.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VampirePrincessMiyu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VampirePrincessMiyu">Vampire Princess Miyu</a></em>, the artist and her assistant from the TV series episode <em>Love of the Dolls</em>. Surely, they are in a happy relationship at the end, but it is impossible to forget how unhealthy and violent they were to each other either, and one has to wonder what will happen in the future for them.
</li><li> At the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeatheringWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeatheringWithYou">Weathering With You</a></em>, Hodaka saves Hina's life, even if it means the heavy rains and flooding will continue. The audience is shown almost immediately that they do indeed continue, and in fact that rain falls continuously for <em>three years</em>, flooding the majority of Tokyo. Hodaka meets with an elderly person who lost their home as a result, but that's the extent of the damage shown on-screen, and while Hodaka seems appropriately concerned at first about the consequences of his actions, the moment he sees Hina he decides immediately that he did the right thing and this is a happy ending. The story sort of vaguely hand waves all of this as being historically normal and that humans are just becoming more in harmony with nature now, which is kind of a flippant way to shrug off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEndorHolocaust">implied deaths of up to thousands of people.</a>

<ul><li> Happens very often with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">Jack Chick</a> tracts. There are too many examples to list specific ones, but they tend to fall into a few distinct categories.
<ol><li> The main character converts to Christianity, dies an untimely (and usually also cruel or painful) death and goes to heaven. For example, in "The Little Princess," while Heidi gets herself and her family saved before dying, one has to wonder what it's like for her parents and brother to lose her.
</li><li> The main characters, following the death of someone close to them, convert to Christianity. The unsaved loved ones are promptly forgotten about, and the saved people will never see them again. This is especially jarring in "Happy Halloween," in which the boy killed in the traffic accident is forgotten about.
</li><li> The main characters convert to Christianity after suffering terrible traumas with no indication of any long-term problems, and with those responsible being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a> or becoming outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdinis</a>. For example, in "Lisa", the girl may have gotten saved and may no longer be suffering abuse, but she also has herpes now and no shortage of trauma associated with this.
</li><li> Truly despicable people do terrible things all their lives, convert after one minute of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism">Easy Evangelism</a>, and go to Heaven, facing no consequences for their actions <em>ever</em>, while people who did nothing wrong except <em>not</em> instantly choose to devote their lives to God, needing more than simply having John 3:16 read to them once in order to believe, have freak accidents kill them the next day and go to Hell. In Chick's theology (which is not shared by the vast majority of Christians, to say the least), this is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">all humans are equally evil</a>, and therefore all repentances are equally good.
</li><li> The ultimate fate of Earth. God will triumph over the Devil, but not before ages of suffering for the people of Earth followed by the majority of humankind being sent to Hell.
</li></ol></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAActOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAActOfGod">JLA: Act of God</a></em> has the story attempting to tell us that a new generation of heroes is about, the problems with this are that there were likely millions of innocents killed due to people losing their powers, few superheroes getting over their problems, and Kyle Rayner, ultimately, ends up killed due to psychotic obsession. This isn't getting into the fact that many tech-based supervillains keep their powers and abilities, and one new, superpowered being doesn't make the world better.

So not only did Peter make a deal with the devil, but he also allowed the devil to trick him into aborting and then forgetting about his own child, after it had been clearly explained to him why it was the wrong thing to do. A lot of fans were quite puzzled about how that could be called a happy ending in any sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> has some in the Uderzo era.
<ul><li> <em>Asterix and Son</em> ends with Brutus getting punished, the Gaulish village he destroyed getting rebuilt, Caesar hosting a banquet for the Gauls and he and Cleopatra reunited with their adorable baby son, Caesarion. The narration notes that Caesarion will become the last pharaoh. Those who know anything about classics (most of the readership...) will realise that all of this will end up in a horrible, murderous disaster. Caesarion certainly would have had a happier and longer life if he'd continued with Asterix and Obelix as his guardians, terrible parents as they are.
</li><li> <em>Asterix and the Secret Weapon</em> ends with both the village's men and women compromising in a way that could be read as a call for a focus on understanding and collaboration to solve social injustice, or just being outrageously sexist, depending on interpretation. Either way, it's very difficult to side with the story after it specifies that women are allowed at the final feast (as they do not attend feasts usually), but they remain absent from all feasts afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> The ending of <em>Night of the Living <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a></em> is a likely intentional example. Every character in the story dies except Deadpool, and humanity is likely wiped out, but Deadpool gets a happy ending through a bizarre twist ending. Deadpool takes a massive dose of the regeneration serum that caused the zombie outbreak and is eaten by the zombies, causing his consciousness to evolve into a sapient zombie virus that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd">spreads to all of the zombies and brings them all under his control as a massive Deadpool hive mind.</a> Deadpool's last words in the comic are "Omnipotence won't be all that bad."
<ul><li> The sequel comic confirms that this wasn't a happy ending. The plot is about a single Deadpool breaking himself free from the hive mind and trying to save what remains of the world from himself, which he eventually accomplishes by getting infected with a new virus that is lethal to him and spreading it to all the other Deadpools.

After a massacre at the superhero therapy facility known as Sanctuary, the murderer, Wally West, tries to commit suicide after releasing the patients/murder victims' confessionals in order to raise awareness about mental health. He's talked out of suicide and is instead imprisoned, but the final messsage is that there's still hope for him, and that he's taken his first step towards bettering himself, while Sanctuary reopens so it can help more people. Most readers did not see this as the happy ending it's meant to be. The releasing of confessionals was portrayed <em>in-universe</em> as bad when it first happened and readers see it as a massive breach of privacy that Wally had no right to leak to Lois Lane, and <em>she</em> had no right to publish. All the dead charactersare still dead, despite the heroes using a time machine to place a cloned Wally body at the time of the incident <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1qzmf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1qzmf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1qzmf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Wally's body was found at the scene of the crime and, through time-travel shenanigans, he was going to kill his future self to put the body at the scene of the crime to maintain the timeline</span> which could have been applied to everyone.

Sanctuary's "therapy" was so terrible that it was seemingly actively goading the patients on — such as repeatedly asking Wally <em>why</em> he wants his family back and allowing <em>repeated self-harm and reliving of death</em> in Lagoon Boy — that <em>no reader</em> saw it as a healthy mental health facility, so the implication that it has reopened with zero change to how it's run... yeah, not happy. The series can't even qualify for a bittersweet, it's just misery.

A Fairy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">tests the politeness of two sisters</a>. She rewards the polite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">youngest sister</a> with having either a jewel, a diamond or a pretty flower fall from her mouth whenever she spoke and curses the rude eldest sister with having either a toad or a snake fall from her mouth whenever she spoke. The mother then drives both out of the house. The good sister meets and marries a prince while the bad sister is rejected by everyone and starves in the woods. One may argue that maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallySympathetic">the eldest sister</a> may not deserve such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">horrible fate</a> or point out that the mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">gets away</a> with the mistreatment of both her daughters. Not that clear with the youngest sister - some will say that the only reason the prince loves her is the gems, but the story only says that the prince fell in love with her after she told him her story, so optimists can believe that he loves her for herself, and merely views the gems as a way to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">Parental Marriage Veto</a>.

Except that Kotura sent a terrible snowstorm that threatened to destroy the entire humanity (or at least everyone who lives in tundra, the narration isnt very clear on the subject), just to blackmail people into sending him a proper bride.

<ul><li> This is common in the darker side of fanfiction (Especially in fetish fics). A good example of this can be found in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3684981/1/The_Plushtopia_Chronicles_Lugia_II">The Plushtopia Chronicles Lugia II.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> For those who don't want to read that, here's the cliff notes version: Guy picks up a plushie that is alive.

He refuses; it violently and painfully kills him and then rebirths him as a plushie. Now they'll be together forever - and it's treated as a good thing.
</li><li> The Rose Potter series is an interesting example. Because the author slavishly copies as much of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> canon as he can, each story ends on a happy note if and when the canon books do. Because the author tries to make things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> however, it just opens up a whole mess of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, plot holes, and generally makes the Ministry's arguments that Rose is psychotic look rational. One fine example would be Rose discovering the "Golden Patronus", which essentially lets her destroy the hundreds of Dementors in the third story. This is treated as a beautiful thing, with the "released souls" thanking her as they return to their bodies. Thing is, Dementors were used to carry out the wizarding equivalent of the death sentence, which means that Rose also released the souls of a number of dangerous criminals.

How, then, is Eric going to keep his subjects fed? A later revision of the story resolves Ariel and Eric's romantic difficulties, but it says nothing more about how to resolve their kingdom's economic problems.

She accomplishes this by killing Calypso. Who, in the movie, was one of the few mystical beings remaining in the sea, especially after the Kraken was destroyed by Beckett, and one of the few things left keeping the world from "getting smaller". Oops... Everyone treats her as a hero for this.

In reality, Morgan and her young Watcher were in love, and Richard spent decades trapped in the demons hell dimension before Buffy released him by killing the demon in the present while briefly possessed by Morgan's spirit.

However, this completely ignores the fact that by abandoning her own game in favor of another, Vanellope is essentially "going Turbo," something that is looked down upon in the first movie. Without the main character, it is only a matter of time before this flaw is found out and <em>Sugar Rush</em> eventually gets unplugged. Ralph still doesn't have his best friend around to confide with, and it's also only a matter of time before Vanellope gets so hooked up in the game that she gradually forgets about Ralph and strains their friendship. Plus, while the Wreck-it Ralph virus has been defeated, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">the Arthur virus that created it was never shown being dealt with</a>, so as far as we know, it's still free to find other insecurities to turn into viruses.

However, while the tone is undeniably happy, consider the facts. The whole reason Linguini and Colette have to open a new restaurant is that Gusteau's ancestral restaurant was closed down after its "rat infestation" was exposed, meaning that the legacy of Gusteau is over and the once-world-famous chef has been reduced to a disgraced joke. Skinner is still obsessed with capturing Remy for his own use, and there's nothing stopping him from pursuing new schemes (however ineffectual they may be). Finally, there's an entire former restaurant staff out there that could, if they wanted to, come forward with believable evidence that Linguini is mentally unwell due to believing in talking, cooking rats, and considering that Linguini's "madness" ruined their careers, they'll likely have a grudge against him and his new restaurant.

Once the friends and families of those humans come, the foods won't have any more bath salts left to defend themselves with. Even if no one came to the store sooner or later most of the foods would expire.

The little mermaid is turned into "daughter of air" with the prospect of eventually entering Heaven, very probably a result of revision by Andersen.

</li><li> <em>A Girl Called Blue</em> is about girls growing up in a strict home for children in 1960s Ireland (run by Sadist Nuns). The book ends with Blue rejoicing that she's finally found a family of her own. Except the "family" is two people she's met twice and they're not allowed to adopt her so she has to wait three years before she's old enough to leave the school with them only allowed to visit her twice a year. Also three of her best friends have now left, one being drowned, another going back to live with her father and the last being sent to another school and she has been forced to sleep alone in a cramped room, and will likely still have to endure plenty more abuse from the nuns for the next three years. Oh and she never finds out who her real mother is either and the nuns will keep abusing children for many years in Ireland.

The protagonist learns that he's stuck as a mouse and that mice don't live very long, but he's happy because he'll probably die near the same time as his elderly grandmother and doesn't care about living if he's not with her; they will live out their lives tracking down and destroying other witches together. The two also ponder Bruno's fate. One states that his mouse-hating mother probably drowned him in a bucket, but nobody seems very disturbed by this possibility. The movie has an unabashed happy ending where the last witch, who had undergone a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, undoes the mouse spell on the protagonist and is implied to do the same to Bruno. While many were appreciative of this happier ending, Roald Dahl was infamously <em>not</em>.
</li><li> Coupled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess">A Little Princess</a></em>. The book ends with Sara being restored to her wealth while Becky becomes her personal attendant. Oh and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Miss Minchin</a> gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">away with treating them like prisoners</a>. However, if one takes into context the period the story is set in (Victorian London) then Becky going from little better than a slave to a powerful position in the household (with a kind and generous mistress too) where she would get a roof over her head and financial security, it's a happy ending for Becky indeed. And while Miss Minchin doesn't get an over-the-top instant comeuppance (save in the film adaptations, which pretty much need one) it's worth remembering that not only has she irrevocably lost her chance at a pupil who could've single-handedly ensured her school's success and her own financial comfort for life; once Sara's story becomes common knowledge in her social circle—as it inevitably will—Minchin's reputation will be in tatters and her school likely ruined. There's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a> for Melchisedec the rat and his family; one hopes kindhearted Sara will remember them and send Ram Dass over there with bread crumbs.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a>,</em> Galt's Gulch is the only non-Crapsack place left in the whole world. Which is great, because all of the looters and moochers are gone and the good people can rebuild the world, right? Then you remember the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust">millions of innocent children who were left to starve...</a> (Then again, by the book's morality, this is the looters' and moochers' fault rather than anything to blame on the protagonists...)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a>.</em> Shu, Wei, and Wu are united into one at last and peace throughout the entire country of China can finally begin. Unfortunately the victors are a splinter group of Wei who usurped the throne, conquered Wu and Shu who at the time were being ruled by Liu Shan (a truly incompetent ruler who defiles everything Shu originally stood for) and Sun Hao (a tyrant almost as bad as Dong Zhuo). The kicker? When these two surrendered they were given lucrative positions and the readers were told they lived out their remaining lives in luxury. To be fair though this novel closely follows the real-life events in history and not a lot could be changed. And historically, the hard-fought reunification of China ended a decade or two later with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">a new barbarian invasion.</a> Also, the war to unify China was itself one of the bloodiest in human history, killing (by highest estimates) 74% of China's population, more people than the Second World War. The victors ruled dust and ashes.
</li><li> Back when <em>The Iron Giant</em> was a book instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIronGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIronGiant">a movie</a>, it ended with an encounter with a dragon-like alien that sang in a hypnotic manner. It sang loud enough that the entire world heard it, and everyone in the world spent the rest of their lives alternately taking care of necessities and listening to the song. It's specified that all war was completely eliminated, and the implication would be that art and culture vanished too. If the wording is to be taken literally, people didn't even converse with each other. Now, does this sound <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia">Utopian</a>, or more like a nightmare?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>:
<ul><li> The last book gave Jacob, who suffered from unrequited love for Bella and who vehemently hated imprinting, his own happy romantic ending by having him imprint on Bella's newborn daughter Nessie. Oh, don't worry; Nessie grows really fast, so she'll be physically 17 years old in 7 years and ready to start a relationship with her "Uncle Jake" then! And what of Jake's loss of free will? Who cares as long as he's still (forced to be) in Bella's life!
</li><li> Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem">there's apparently no good way to get rid of the Volturi or vampires like them</a>. Given that the Volturi are growing more and more afraid of human technology, and more and more inclined to lash out at humanity, this is a <em>very bad thing</em>. Das-Sporking's MST, when it gets to the end of <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, points out that their "victory" at the end really isn't one, as while the Volturi are gone <em>for now</em>, they have been given all the information needed to defeat the Cullens should they come around again.
</li><li> On a more personal note, Nessie is hardly the "perfect ending" for the rest of the Cullens that Meyer claims. Esme and Rose want biological children of their own to care for and raise. Nessie is already nearly at adult-level independence within weeks of birth, and she's <em>Bella's</em> daughter, not theirs. Nessie also can't bring back Alice's human memories, she has almost no relationship with any of the other male Cullens, etc. Meyer seems to think that Nessie fixes everything just by existing, but realistically she creates many, many more problems than she fixes for them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BendSinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BendSinister">Bend Sinister</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VladimirNabokov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VladimirNabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a> ends with the protagonist arrested by his nation's totalitarian government, and his young son horrifically killed by a crowd of mental patients—on film!—due to a <em>clerical error</em>. But then Nabokov <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metafiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metafiction">reaches through the layers of reality</a> and gives his main character the gift of insanity to make him forget all his pain. The novel ends with Adam Krug, as a result of his insanity, rushing the dictator and being shot to death. Nabokov, however, refuses to write this conclusion (after implying its inevitability) and instead describes his room and decides to go mothing. It's a strange case of being incapable of giving Krug a happy ending (even the insanity so benevolently bestowed upon him results directly in his being killed), and so at least giving him the consolation prize of not writing it at all, and therefore not allowing it to happen. It's about as esoteric as a 'happy ending' can get.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em> gets this a lot for its ending where not only are all non-Christians sent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">Fire and Brimstone Hell</a>, but the paradise where all the protagonists end up is depicted as a faintly creepy commune where you can no longer eat meat or form relationships with anyone you want, and nobody experiences any strong emotions other than love of God. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">The writers treat this as a utopia.</a>

</li><li> The sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> of applying this trope to "The Street" is why it's almost impossible to find it in print, as it involves treating the spontaneous collapse of an overcrowded slum that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">kills everybody living there</a> as a good thing. Why? Because A: it used to be a beautiful Colonial country lane line with rosebushes and is now a dirty slum, and B: all of the people living in it are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilForeigner">dirty non-WASP immigrants ungratefully plotting revolution against America for taking them in</a>... at least, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">so the narration says they are</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush">Hush, Hush</a></em> has a great happy ending, if you ignore the fact that part of Nora's house was burned down, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> of a fallen angel after her, and that she is blissfully dating the guy who spent the book stalking her, sexually harassing her, and outright attempting to <em>murder her</em>.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoddessTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoddessTest">The Goddess Test</a></em>, Kate's beloved mother is actually the goddess Demeter, so she and her mother can be together for eternity. Sounds great, huh? Except if you think back to the prologue, where we hear Demeter outright telling Hades that she's going to have her second daughter take the goddess test and be his wife, even though eleven girls have already died in the attempt and Hades <em>says</em> he wants to just give up rather than see anyone else die for him. There's also the fact that the last girl who was manipulated into an arranged marriage with Hades later begged for death. Throughout the story, there is a lot of emphasis on the fact that being there is Kate's choice. However, the reason she made the deal with Henry in the first place was to save Ava and then the reason she kept the deal was so that he could keep her mother alive and she could spend time with her before she died. Except you find out that both Ava and Diana are Goddesses and were never in any real danger. So that means that while it was technically Kate's choice, her entire choice was based on a lie. Plus the ending reveals that Diana put her daughter through four years of emotional turmoil by making her think that her mother was on the verge of death for years and forcing Kate to take care of her for no reason other than to set her up for the test.
</li><li> The "Susannah in New York" epilogue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> series has Susannah going into an alternate reality version of New York where Eddie and Jake are still alive and in fact are brothers. She appears in Central Park at Christmas time, alternate-Eddie greets her with a cup of hot chocolate, and it's clearly supposed to be her happy ending... Except many readers feel that Susannah abandoned the quest and is now trapped in a world that isn't her own with a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a> who aren't really the people she loved.
</li><li> The end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkIsRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkIsRising">The Dark Is Rising</a></em> sequence is unsatisfying in several ways. The forces of the Dark have been beaten back; all the main characters are OK and have forged a close bond; Bran has grown up normal, decided to stay with his foster-father, and has realised he's attracted to Jane. But not only do five of the Six have to forget that magic exists and never see their beloved Merriman again, the lovely magic of the Light is going to withdraw from the world altogether. And poor John Rowland is going to believe that his wife has suddenly died (which is presented as better than knowing she was an agent of the Dark). Will gets to remember everything because he's an Old One, but he'll have nobody to talk to about it for most of the time.
</li><li> Chris Adrian's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChildrensHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChildrensHospital">The Childrens Hospital</a></em> ends with every single adult left on Earth dying, as the global flooding recedes and the children leave the eponymous hospital to inherit their new Earth. The final image is the main character screaming as her newborn child is taken away and she dissolves into ash. Lampshaded throughout the book by the narrator who, as an angel who was once human, is supposed to wholeheartedly accept the end of the world as righteous, but can't quite do so.
</li><li> Whatever Evelyn Waugh may say about God's love and the power for redemption in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridesheadRevisited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridesheadRevisited">Brideshead Revisited</a></em>, the facts remain as such: Sebastian's a hopeless alcoholic, Julia and Charles, having gone through with their respective divorces, decide never to see each other again, and the entire world is going to be inherited by the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Mottram</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Hooper</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSoldierSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSoldierSon">The Soldier Son</a></em>. After almost three books of stressing how bad it is for Nevare's soul to be split, he is finally reunited with Soldier's Boy and absorbed by an ancestor tree, together with his beloved Lisana. Is this the end? No, he is split again. Admittedly, that half gets back together with Amzil, marries her and inherits the Nevare estate, but wasn't it bad to have one's personality split? Other issues concern the discovery of gold that draw the Gernians away from the Speck lands: how long before they'll return? And finally, Nevare completely destroys the source of the Plainspeople's magic in the process, sealing their fate. This is given almost no attention.
</li><li> Some of the "good" endings in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChooseYourOwnAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChooseYourOwnAdventure">Choose Your Own Adventure</a></em> books merely consists of the main character surviving, stopping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> temporarily, or implying that <em>perhaps</em> you will have success in the future, leaving many plot points unsolved.
</li><li> The final book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemonsLexicon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemonsLexicon">The Demon's Lexicon</a></em> has the surviving magicians pulling a mass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and joining the Goblin Market. Except we're given no reason to believe that it's genuine with all or even any of them, and they're probably just planning to destroy the Market from within.
</li><li> Inverted with Edmond Hamilton's 1932 short story 'The Man Who Evolved', which is traditionally interpreted as having the soul-crushingly nihilistic ending of learning that the human race is doomed to devolve into primordial ooze, and there is nothing that anybody, not even a Sufficiently Advanced super-intelligence, can do to prevent it. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> shows that there are two ways in which the ending can be interpreted more optimistically: either Pollard continues down the path of Hollywood Evolution, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascending to a higher plane of existence</a> and becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Being</a> while leaving his body behind as protoplasm, or the story can be interpreted as set in the same universe as Hamilton's later short story, "Devolution", in which microbes are the most advanced forms of life, which developed an interstellar civilization and only got stuck on Earth after they de-evolved into all other forms of life (in which case Pollard could conceivably have retained his augmented intelligence). Note that neither of these interpretations alleviates the horror of Pollard's steady <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity">Loss of Identity</a> as he travels through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">Evolutionary Levels</a>, however.

Having done so, they're bored. So the gods recreate the bad guys so that the good guys can have fun beating them again. And so the world is condemned to an eternity of warfare because otherwise the princes would get bored. This was because the book is specifically inspired by Nordic myth and legend, retaining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">original source morality</a>.
</li><li> <em>Quest for the White Witch</em>, the final novel in Tanith Lees <em>Birthgrave</em> trilogy, ends with Vazkor finally meeting his neglectful mother. And the two decide that they like each other enough to enter into an incestuous mother/son marriage. This is considered all right because they are both essentially deities.

Amy finally has someone she can be herself with and Nick has the child he always wanted. They may eventually kill each other but, at heart, they're <em>both</em> sociopaths. This is averted in the film version, where Nick comes across more sympathetically.

While Lief is a good king, all the Shadow Lord has to do is wait for a descendant he can manipulate... and this is the guy who, we are often told, considers a thousand years to be like the blink of an eye.

<ul><li> The first book actually has a potential <em>inversion</em>; it ends with Ana deciding she and Christian are incompatible and leaving him, which the book treats as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, but many readers see this as a good thing because the relationship is unhealthy and disproportionately skewed in Christian's favor.

Again and again, her protagonists (often ironically and grotesquely) lose everything they thought they wanted and valued—their possessions, their dignity, their self-image, even their lives. Burned down back to the foundations, they are left unarmored, often ridiculous and humiliated, but finally open to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">terrible incursion of God's grace</a>. O'Connor famously claimed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WiseBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WiseBlood">Wise Blood</a></em> had a "very hopeful" ending; this reading, though, absolutely depends on understanding the author's and protagonist's priorities, which many readers have trouble internalizing.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuantumThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuantumThief">The Quantum Thief</a></em> trilogy ends with Mieli breaking the Planck Locks with the aid of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin">Kaminari Jewel</a> and using her newfound power to create an entirely new universe to all the people on Saturn, including the uploaded minds of Earth's remaining population. Unfortunately, this also means that the heartless Sobornost collective is left to rule the rest of the Solar System unchecked, now that their worst enemies are out of the picture, and it's only a matter of time before they consume all the remaining small civilisations in the System, including Mieli's own people, the Oortians. On the other hand, the story ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayOfHopeEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayOfHopeEnding">another copy of Jean le Flambeur being released</a>, which could result in another wrench thrown in Sobornost's plans — maybe.
</li><li> <em>The Beast Within: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATaleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATaleOf">A Tale Of...</a> Beauty's Prince</em> does this to the happy ending of Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em>. The curse is broken, the Beast is human again, and he and Belle are together... except the novella adds a backstory for the Beast that involves dumping his first fiancee for being poor, horrifically abusing his second fiancee and gleefully allowing her family to go to ruin, and <em>ordering a hit on a painter</em> because he didn't like the fact that the painting reflected the curse on him. Belle never learns about any of this, which means she's unwittingly ending up with someone considerably worse than she thought, while the Beast himself has forgotten his past for reasons never fully explained, meaning there's no chance of him learning from his past or making amends. The ending is still treated as completely happy, but more than a few readers have expressed a wish for Belle to leave the Beast altogether.

The apocalypse that the main characters have been trying to prevent comes to pass, killing off the majority of the planet's population (including the protagonist's biological mother and sister, the latter of whom was also the love interest for said protagonist's adopted brother), and the new world is a dangerous place inhabited mostly by mutants...but hey, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheLeadsGetAHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheLeadsGetAHappyEnding">the Flock survived!</a> And Max <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter">gave birth to a daughter!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">At about sixteen</a>...and this is all before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring">Hawk</a></em> came out and hit it with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride">Happy Ending Override</a>.

He then steals Susan's DNA from her tomb, has a duplicate of her created, implants it with Susan's memories up to shortly before the incident that led to her life-threatening injury, and maroons them both on an uninhabited planet, deceiving the duplicate into believing that she's the original Susan and it's still 2261. This was apparently considered to be a happy ending for both of them, but it absolutely horrified many fans who saw it as a grotesque, abusive violation of the duplicate's right to self-determination.

However, it is revealed later in the season that Peri in fact did not die and actually went on to rule Krontep alongside Yrcanos as his queen.

Fortunately, Sally gave that photo to the Doctor, who can hopefully dispose of it. But regarding the <em>original</em> Angels, the only thing keeping them immobilized is one bare lightbulb, which could burn out at any moment, and which <em>they telepathically turned off earlier in the episode</em>.

This is easily the happiest season ending of any in the RTD era. It wouldn't even be all that esoteric except for a few "little" things. Martha Jones and her family still remember this horrific, PTSD-inducing year.

Britain lost its best political minds when the Master gassed them all, and also lost a courageous woman whom the Toclafane tortured to death for resisting the Master. And speaking of the Toclafane, the final, definitive fate for humanity is that in the last generation, all of the humans (even the best of them) will within that generation degenerate into monstrous, childish thrill-killers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">making everything on the show that has anything to do with humanity feel completely pointless.</a>

In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>, the Doctor repents and ends up being mind-wiped of memories of her, leaving him free to move on with his life, while the now-functionally immortal Clara ends up with her own TARDIS and fellow functional immortal Ashildr/Me. She decides to go back to Gallifrey and her death "the long way 'round" in pursuit of new adventures, as the universe will hold together so long as she returns at <em>some</em> point. The problems with this come from several angles, only one of which was addressed in the televised continuity by this Doctor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> and departure of writer/showrunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>, meaning they might <em>never</em> be revisited:
<ul><li> Clara can never return to her old life on Earth; though by this point it meant little to her compared to a life of adventure, it's still pretty sad for her loved ones and colleagues who will only know her to have died a mysterious death. And since the universe <em>is</em> holding together, what finally gets Clara to return to her <strong>extremely painful</strong> death? Will she remember she has to go back? Be forced into it? Screw up so badly that death seems the only way to atone?
</li><li> The Doctor didn't take Me on as a companion because as a virtual immortal himself both of them would become detached from mortals and even <em>villainous</em> — a problem she was already struggling with and an indirect contributor to Clara's death (she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInVillainy">Trapped in Villainy</a> and had to betray the Doctor, and Clara messed that up). Thus, the women could become what the Doctor feared — and he wouldn't be able to stop them — unless they acquire mortal companions. As well, can Clara be happy with a companion who's virtually an anti-Doctor given how much she came to love and need him?
</li><li> After millennia spent pining for them and defending them, the Doctor is now a fugitive from his people and Gallifrey — again — for his actions during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>.

</li><li> The Doctor suffered mightily just to save Clara, as depicted in "Heaven Sent". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a> should come into play given how the Whoniverse tends to work, but instead he, a <strong>torture victim</strong>, is given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy">No Sympathy</a> whereas <em>Rassilon the murdering dictator</em> is. He gives up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream">Tragic Dream</a>, and undergoes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> — whereupon Clara and Ashildr/Me <em>randomly dump him on Earth</em>, leaving him wandering about reconstructing the few Clara-related memories he retains and seeking his TARDIS, last seen abandoned in London. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> has Clara (whom he no longer recognizes) return the TARDIS to him and he moves on, but he isn't rewarded for choosing the path of right <em>and</em> has been robbed of his right to grieve and rage. As it's unknown how much time passes between this story and "The Husbands of River Song", how long is the Doctor left bereft and brooding without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">Morality Chain</a> (a key reason why he went crazy)? Sure, he has the TARDIS, but it can't hug him. For the record, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> is the <em>one</em> aspect of this ending addressed and undone (and only at the <em>very</em> end of the Twelfth Doctor's life, shortly before he regenerates).

Problem is, nowhere there do we see the Doctor address the original problem at all, so there's no reason to believe the robots won't do the same thing after someone else dies in a few weeks/months/years' time. Nor does he explain to most of the colonists that their friends and family might be dead after the massive misunderstanding either.

Unfortunately, during those six months, dissenters to the Monks were imprisoned, forced into labor camps, and even executed. What will become of people who lost loved ones but can't remember what became of them and why, and of the still-living victims of the Monks' reign? Worse, Bill and the Doctor technically have culpability in the Monks' reign of terror. Granted, she made her deal to save the doomed Doctor's life partially because she knew he was their last best hope to get rid of the Monks altogether. He served as the Monks' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropagandaMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropagandaMachine">Propaganda Machine</a> only as a cover for his resultant plan. But they still ought to feel remorse over all the people who suffered and died in the interim; instead they're more concerned with her overdue essay on free will (overdue <em>because</em> of the Monks).

However, in the show's other place where it was practiced, the Iron Islands, it just became a rubber-stamp for Greyjoy after Greyjoy to be elected until they got awful leaders like Balon and Euron, and in the books it ended with an Ironborn using the opportunity to slaughter his rivals. Add to it Sansa deciding to just declare Northern independence even after Bran's elected and it leaves serious doubts that they'll be able to avoid either informal hereditary rule or instability. There's also Bran who is the Three-Eyed Raven and has supernatural powers that let him see the past and present, making an omniscient ruler who can see everything. While the narrative guarantees that he's benevolent, the circumstances on how he became king after the deaths of Cersei and Daenerys made a lot of viewers suspect at best he's indirectly responsible for Daenerys' downfall, at worst, actually enabled it through selective sharing AND omission of information, which makes Bran come off as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">ambitious asshole</a>.

By the reaction of the kids — essentially, "Mom's been dead for 6 years, go bang Aunt Robin, Dad!" — this is meant to be the ultimate happy ending of two long-lost lovers. You wonder if the writers realize that the blue french horn, which Ted holds up for Robin at the end, has become an object of derision and tragedy in the fanbase. There's also no real reason to believe Ted and Robin are actually going to work out this time since the show had previously spent quite a bit of time deconstructing their relationship and ultimately showing them as incompatible. Most of the issues that caused them to break up in the past haven't been resolved, nor have they ever managed to overcome them in their numerous attempts to get together in the past. It's worth noting that the ending was planned and in part filmed (the parts with the kids) years earlier. As a consequence, many of the reasons for the ending not working (establishing Barney and Robin as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan-Preferred Couple</a> who'd have to be broken up and the various issues the writers had to raise in the Ted/Robin relationship to explain these two single supposedly "perfect for each other" people not being together all these years) hadn't been developed yet. Additionally, the ending relied on the romantic trope of making a big "romantic gesture" and living happily ever after. Unfortunately, the long-running nature of the show meant it ultimately subverted this trope by having characters making these gestures repeatedly only to definitively not end up with the person they made the gesture to, thereby showing how it's definitely not guaranteed.
</li><li> The TV movie <em>Ice Angel</em> is about a male hockey player (Matt) who dies and is brought back to life in the body of a female figure skater (Sarah) so he can win an Olympic gold medal on the ice. He is surprised and unhappy at his unasked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> but adjusts to his new life and learns to let go of his old girlfriend and friends who have moved on. As he (now she) is in the middle of winning the gold medal, the two angels who have been watching over Matt mention that as soon as the performance is over 'Sarah' will forget all about being Matt. This is presented as a happy ending but comes across more like Matt — who already has his Aesop and seems content to continue life as Sarah — gets his identity erased for no good reason. This holds true to the source of the story <em>Here Comes Mr. Jordan</em> (which the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenCanWait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenCanWait">Heaven Can Wait</a></em> is also based off of) where the soul and habits of the deceased do live on in the new body but they will forget everything else about their adventures and time in Heaven and the Afterlife Bureaucracy. It is meant to help the soul and person go back to living a normal life.

The ending appears to be predicated on the audience believing that Helheim is in fact just a mindless plant and doesn't bear any blame for the worlds it invades and ruins, but its avatar being one of the most intelligent and philosophically-driven characters in the show means it instead comes across as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>.

Everybody from the Island remains friends in the afterlife, except for the ones you don't see for some reason. Okay, fine. But why does Sayid have to be with Shannon and lose Nadia? Why can't Locke stay with Helen? Christian Shepherd seems to have dictatorial powers over the lives of people he didn't even really know. Plus, it's implied that several of the characters who outlived Jack led long lives, yet apparently none of them formed any meaningful relationships during the intervening years—so Kate, Sawyer, and Claire all potentially spent decades mourning their respective love interests and never loving anyone else, while Aaron and Ji-Yeon apparently had such empty lives that they entered the afterlife as babies whose only bonds are with their parents. And Miles just gets abandoned and forgotten in limbo, despite his apparent devotion to Sawyer.

While Smith's soul was so far gone by this point that the world would be better off without him, it's already pointed out that even if he died <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPowerVacuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPowerVacuum">he would just be replaced with someone else</a>. The US has been ruled by the Nazi regime for twenty years, with all the indoctrination and fanaticism of rank and file soldiers and citizens that implies. His replacement would have to contend with hardliners and rogue units in the American Reich attempting to depose him, not to mention the Reichsfuhrer in Berlin might just decide that his deal with Smith is null and void with the latter's death. It's a recipe for a civil war. Japan is also still lording over a massive empire in the Pacific and East Asia, with the withdrawal from North America giving them renewed resources to keep those territories under their thumb. And with the Nebenswelt smack-dab in the middle between two formerly oppressed sub-countries, a massive cache of unforeseen and unprecedented wealth and technological potential in the hands of subversive rebels who made it their mission to tick both sides off, it's implied that a second American Civil War is inevitable.

Aside from the fact that the series completely romanticized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">Teen Pregnancy</a> (never even alluding to all the emotional and economical problems a sixteen-year-old having a child will have), the finale also failed to address the huge problems both of the main couples had over the course of the series (Manuel dismissing Mia and cheating on her, Marizza misjudging Pablo) and tries to paint a picture of all being forgiven and true love saving the day. For a series that was recommended for trying to tackle real subjects in a realistic manner, this poorly thought-out ending seemed to have come out of some fairy tale kitsch desire.

According to Sisko this is one of the most momentous days in human history and helped pave the way for the Federation (as we see when their actions accidentally wipe it out). Unfortunately, as anyone who is up on their Trek history knows; this episode is set two years before the Third World War. Everyone you see in this episode grinning about how bright their futures now are?

The excuse was that the Valakians were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">fated to die according to evolution</a>, and so it would somehow be immoral to cure them.

She and her parents <em>are</em> psychic and can communicate very well, but after they're killed in a fire, she is sent to live with foster parents who are unaware of her psychic abilities and try to get her to speak normally. At school, her teacher basically torments her and makes her life a living hell until she finally begins speaking. Another psychic couple shows up wanting to adopt her and continue developing her psychic powers, but the girl turns them away, saying she'd rather stay with her foster parents. As the couple leaves, they comment that it was just as well that she stayed behind, as her psychic abilities had been destroyed by the horrific treatment she'd received at the school. It is stated by pretty much every adult character that this is a happy ending for Ilsa, in spite of the fact that she was tormented at school and lost a paranormal ability in the process. (The author has claimed that her original parents treated her more as a science experiment than a daughter, but there's nothing in the final version of the story to suggest that.)

However, virtually all the changing breeds have been killed and the human race has been hurled back into the stone age.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> features an in-universe case in the Followers of Set clanbook: during the history chapter, the narrator briefly focuses on the disastrous events of the Children's Crusade, and true to history, it ended with the majority of the children either dead or sold at the slave markets of Alexandria. Of course, the Followers of Set admit to buying several consignments of enslaved crusaders, many of whom ended up as temple servants - or blood sacrifices. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">the narrator assures the reader that this is actually a happy ending</a> - because out the thousands of children enslaved and murdered by the cult, <em>eleven</em> of them were Embraced into the clan... and <em>four</em> live on as respected elders of a vampire clan dedicated to furthering corruption and decay throughout the world.

<ul><li> The end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Grease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Grease">Grease</a></em>, in which Sandy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAWhoreToGetYourMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAWhoreToGetYourMan">remakes herself as less of a Sandra Dee innocent</a> in order to win the attraction of Danny, has both its defenders and detractors. Depending on how well each individual show portrays it, either an uptight girl learns to loosen up a little in order to get the guy she's attracted to, who himself has been attempting to do the same, or else a perfectly fine woman changes herself for the worse in order to be conform with people who have acted like jerks for the past two acts. It's worth noting that in the film adaptation's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieBonusSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieBonusSong">Movie Bonus Song</a> "You're the One That I Want", the major theme of the song is "You better shape up" - in short, whether or not Sandy has changed for the worse, she's <em>not</em> going to put up with Danny's douchebaggery, and she makes it clear from the word go. So this trope may not apply to the film.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s got several of these. They're sometimes classed as "the problem plays," because it's hard to figure out what to do with them.
<ul><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a></em> can be interpreted in many ways, which fall into three basic categories: A. Based on the values of the time, it's a happy ending in which an unpleasant shrew gets what's coming to her and learns a valuable lesson. B. Interpreted subversively, Katarina either learns to manipulate her husband or they come to an understanding. C. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTest">Katarina's rudeness was just a test</a> and Petruchio has passed: especially if Katarina's other suitors are played as particularly foppish. D. Taken literally, it's a comedy that becomes a tragedy, in which a strong-willed woman has her spirit broken by the kind of physical and psychological abuse favored by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">domestic abusers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">interrogation experts</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">members of any political party you don't like</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">everyone thinks that's a good thing</a>.
<ul><li> It's even worse if you consider the epilogue by Ben Johnson, which often is not included due to being a later addition. You see, there's a framing device in the play where a drunk is taken off of the street, dressed up like royalty, and shown the production of the play, all for the amusement of a nobleman. The epilogue shows that the drunk passes out, is put back in his own clothes, and left on the streets again. When he wakes up, he decides that it was all a dream and decides to use the tale of Kate and Petruchio as a lesson on how to deal with his own shrewish wife. Yeah...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice">The Merchant of Venice</a></em>. Okay, this one might just be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, since a Jew being forcibly converted to Christianity was considered a good thing at the time. All the same...the play is <em>very</em> dark for a Shakespearean comedy, prejudice seems to be a theme running through the whole story, and Shylock does get that "if you prick us, do we not bleed" speech. And, frankly, while Shylock's a terrible person, all the Christian characters in the play are greedy, unlikeable bastards. Are we really supposed to be glad they won? This tends to be the reason most productions take Shylock's side, and treat the ending as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">a downer.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AllsWellThatEndsWell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AllsWellThatEndsWell">All's Well That Ends Well</a></em> ends with the sweet, lovely and clever Helena having succeeded in forcing the young nobleman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Bertram</a> — a snobby, childish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who hated her guts for no good reason — to marry her. And this is clearly <em>not</em> just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, because other characters point out that Bertram is clearly not good enough for her. But the play seems like a comedy, so...yay?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MeasureForMeasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MeasureForMeasure">Measure for Measure</a></em> has the just, lawful Duke put back in power, the wicked chancellor Angelo punished and made to marry his forgotten sweetheart, and the virtuous Isabella marrying the Duke. Great! Except... the Duke is kind of an amoral fellow who sits back and watches his own city fall apart, any woman getting married to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvilAndIAmHorny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvilAndIAmHorny">Angelo</a> should <em>not</em> consider that a happy ending, and Isabella is a nun-in-training who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">Does Not Like Men</a>, loathes the thought of sex, and she and the Duke have practically no interaction before he says they'll get married. Although the last part is more ambiguous than "happy", as there is no scripted response from Isabella to the Duke's marriage proposal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LoveNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LoveNeverDies">Love Never Dies</a></em> tries for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>: Meg accidentally kills Christine, but she dies in the Phantom's arms, affirming her love for him, and their son Gustave is willing to accept him as his father. But nothing suggests that the Phantom is fit to be a father to the boy — after all, he's a mentally deranged murderer. Meanwhile, Raoul (who, alcoholic and gambler though he may be, did raise the boy for ten years) is presumably returning to France alone without even the money he needs to pay his debts, and while Meg's fate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">is never revealed</a>, it's likely that <em>at best</em> she'll be sent to prison for what she did. And according to the original prologue of the London version, the beautiful Phantasma amusement park subsequently burns down and its freaks, shunned by the "ordinary" world, live in its remains! Where did the owner and his son go?
<ul><li> It doesn't help that the Phantom pulls a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> in all this; he manipulates and destroys everyone around him and gets the woman he loves killed, and in return he gets...a loving hug from his son. Yay?
</li><li> It's even worse in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomOfManhattan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomOfManhattan">The Phantom of Manhattan</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederickForsyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederickForsyth">Frederick Forsyth</a>, which was based on early ideas for a stage sequel and has some concepts that persisted into <em>Love Never Dies</em>. In that version, the Phantom's son, here named Pierre, is explicitly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a> (the show changes this to a consensual one-night stand) and Raoul is a perfectly decent man who just happens to have been rendered infertile in a tragic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a> and genuinely loved Pierre. But we're still supposed to cheer when Pierre chooses Erik, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorifiedSpermDonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorifiedSpermDonor">based solely on the fact that he's the biological father</a> — a decision treated by another character as a God-given miracle!
</li></ul></li><li> Practically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in opera:
<ul><li> The opera <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Turandot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Turandot">Turandot</a></em>. Essentially, deposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharming">Prince Charming</a> hooks up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">the evil queen</a> (well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">evil princess</a>), immediately after she tortures his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth">loyal slave girl to death</a>. Yes, this is supposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">trigger</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Defrosting of the Ice Queen</a>, but seriously, they get a happily-ever-after wedding hours after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">she tortured the best person in the whole opera to death</a></em> - and nice job sending their life - and the hope of your people - into ruins, O Mighty Prince Calaf!
<ul><li> In real stage time, it takes place <em>minutes</em> after.
</li></ul></li><li> Apparently, Leo Janáček thought the ending of his opera <em>The Cunning Little Vixen</em> was soothing and happy enough to be played at his funeral, while it would otherwise generally be considered a (heavy on the bitter) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>. To recap: the title character has been shot dead, leaving her cubs to fend for themselves, and her skin made into a wedding gift so her killer, a poacher, can marry the human protagonist's sweetheart instead of him. But, hey, he gets to reflect on the cycle of life and death, so all's well! (It's worth noting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAdaptation">this dark turn wasn't present in the source material</a>, and this is <em>still</em> lighter than most of Janáček's operas.)
</li><li> The ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Jenufa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Jenufa">Jenufa</a></em>, another of Janaček's operas, is either that or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>. Depends on the production, on the tenor who sings Laca, and on your interpretation. To put it short, the heroine, after all sorts of suffering, finds true love  with the man who has previously scarred her for life in a fit of jealous rage, effectively frightening off all suitors except himself. He says he has repented and admits that by disfiguring the girl he caused many of the subsequent tragic events of the opera. If his remorse (and Jenufa's forgiveness) are convincing, then it's classic bittersweet. If not, it's this trope.
</li><li> And the there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeFredericHandel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeFredericHandel">George Frederic Handel</a>'s <em>Ariodante</em>, in which the title character commits suicide (he gets better) after finding out that his betrothed, Princess Ginevra, has been unfaithful (actually a scam by a competitor, who wants him out of the way to get Ginevra for himself). She is disowned by her father, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy">ignores her grief and protestations of innocence</a>, regards her as a harlot, and condemns her to death. When Ariodante is revealed to be alive and the plot is unmasked, Ginevra is reunited with him and all is forgiven...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">including her father's disowning her and death sentence?</a> Small wonder that a 2014 production made Ginevra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">considerably less forgiving</a>.

Consequently, Spider-Man feels sorry for him and wishes there was something he could do. When Madame Webb congratulates him and assures him that the day is his, he glumly asks, "Yeah?

Fans tend to assume that people are reverting to fossil fuels as a stopgap to keep society going while looking for more ecologically sound alternatives, but there's no evidence for this in the text, and - as we know from real life - switching over is unlikely to be easy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> ends on an upbeat note, with Squall having made substantial progress in overcoming his emotional issues, Ultimecia defeated, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Time Compression</a> thus prevented. Unfortunately, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> means that Ultimecia's rise in the future, and her subsequent reign of terror up until her death at the hands of the protagonists, are inevitable.

Your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">opinion on Ardyn</a> and your own political views will probably influence whether a good guy being in charge of that institution is a happy ending or not.

</li><li> Like a lot of works that feature both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality warping</a> and a "face reality" Aesop, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> ends with the characters returning to the real world and facing all the problems they'd previously tried to escape from. This makes a certain degree of sense in the Japanese version, but the English translation puts less emphasis on how many people are suffering in Mewt's world (which is implied by the fact that three zombies/vampires share the same names as Mewt's bullies), and more emphasis on the idea that perhaps said world is just as real as their own, making the whole thing somewhat pointless. What's more, Doned is still crippled.

Not to mention that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">the leadership of Neverwinter</a> doesn't answer for unjustly executing two staunch champions of the city as scapegoats, which means none of the wrongs anyone ever did Aribeth were addressed.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>, there are hints that the Hero of Neverwinter had a severe falling out with Lord Nasher and walked away from the city. If you accept that the Hero of Neverwinter is also the same person as the protagonist of last expansion pack, then its likely he walked away due to the fact that the city was demonizing his two good friends, Fentwick and Aribeth, who he <em>knows</em> are generally innocent of the crimes laid against them.
</li></ul></li><li> The good ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eversion">Eversion</a></em> plays this for laughs—the princess still turns into a monster, but the hero becomes a monster as well, and the two live happily ever after.

Instead of giving it to the ghost of Athena to rebuild mankind on her terms, he commits suicide to release it to all of mankind... The currently busy with drowning, being riddled with plagues and locust swarms, tormented by the dead returning from the graves and having no afterlife, having to escape fire falling from the sky, ravaged by constant lightning strikes and uncontrollable storms and living in a world without sunlight, order or gods of mankind. Literally, the only thing they have left is hope. The only bright side is that without the tyranny of the Olympians, the world can finally heal and start over.
<ul><li> According to IGN, the whole thing is supposed to play out as a Twisted "Comedic" Tragedy, where the main character makes all the wrong decisions; fighting the gods, killing the gods, feeding innocent people (more than one in this game) to death traps, and leaving the power vacuum without a successor. It's heavily implied that this is not any kind of happy or downer ending; Kratos WON... and that's a bad thing.

Worse yet, despite her good nature, she is surrounded by and associated with many of the game's cruelest villains, to where an uninitiated person might just assume she is one of them. Even in the main ending, Marle only mentions her in passing, asking if she factors into another party member's plans - Everyone is just supposed to accept that their victory came with only one lasting sacrifice.

And by killing Polaris, the world has lost all supernatural aspects that were, yes, trying to kill them, but also removed all possible benevolent help they could have gotten. Humanity is now likely doomed to die of starvation and this situation could cause people to go back and become violent again. The only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a> is that the next person in line for the Heavenly Throne will arrive and fix things, but how soon that will happen...

In a game that pulled no punches in showing how the police quickly got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower">Drunk with Power</a> and took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">Police Brutality</a> to horrifying extremes once they got their hands on the summoning app, and also showed the government was planning on wiping out everyone in Tokyo in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">Final Solution</a> if the crisis got out of control.

<ul><li> The game has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a> and the 'semi-good' ending is this. Elle became the millionth divergence crystal, humanity has successfully completed Origin's trial and he has removed all fractured dimensions, as was the party's plan. Everyone's doing fine and Ludger is shown to meet Lara, with implications that they will fall in love, get married and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Elle</a>. However, this ending implies that Ludger could go down the same path of his alternate self in the fractured dimensions, turning into 'Victor', who murdered majority of the Xillia past when they tried to use Elle. Considering how this ending is called 'Fate Repeater' <em>and</em> it's the only ending that gives you the Victor Costume, the implications are definitely there.
</li><li> Even the best, true ending is this. The entire plot of the game involves destroying alternate universes, and the game doesn't hide that everyone in those universes dies. While there are some scenes of party members feeling bad about it, they quickly get over it and the party just accepts this as a necessary evil. By the time of the ending, everyone is long done feeling bad about about destroying alternate realities, which means that not only does the ending involve killing trillions of people when all the remaining realities are destroyed, but nobody even cares.

Jake, the main hero in this game tried to kill The Queen, but unluckily, she was completely awoke and uses her psychokinesis power to freeze his move. This leaded his father, Jonathan (in his Warmech-II suit), performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> by shooting at the water bubble pod that envelopes The Queen, which distracted her from using her psychokinetic power to Jake, then an AZA reached the atmosphere of earth, leading Jake to self-destruction in his volition towards The Queen to kill her immediately (According to a certain description in loading screen, if the Warmech-III gets destroyed, the pilot link gets severed and causes brain death to the person who controls the Warmech). The AZA was returned back to the origin after The Queen got killed by an explosion came from a self-destruction, so the world was finally saved. However, Jonathan died as a result of his sacrifice, and Jake ended up having a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia">memory loss</a> in hospital after his brain got operated and put an AI-related device to awake him from unconsciousness after the final events. So its a happy ending for whole humanity and a protagonist survived, but not in a condition that some players want. Because he is no longer remember anything, including his identity which means he cant remember his family, his world-saving mission, and more. While some players pitied everyone (especially those who are innocent) who got infected and corrupted by XADAs are in their tragic fate, not just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> and morphed into XADAs, it was implied that the XADA infections have no cure at all, in which killing them is the only solution. Even worse, the story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">suddenly ends</a> and followed by a credits roll right after the scene of the wheelchair girl who wanted to name him since he is an amnesiac now, leading players to confusion.

Things might not have gone so hot for Link after the ending. There's also the knowledge that even though Link went back in time and created a new timeline where Hyrule <em>wasn't</em> burned and conquered by Ganondorf, the original timeline is still going on, one where the people are finally free, but a lot of them are dead, the castle is completely destroyed in a lake of lava, and the Hero of Time has vanished and thus can't help them anymore, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">leading to the flooding of Hyrule when Ganondorf resurfaces</a>.

What makes this an example is the ending dialogue features a voiceover of the aged hero, with many implications he's at the end of his life, his female companion has died and he's back to square one of being alone again. The game ends following his monologue.

Given, there is some timeline confusion between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>, but the fact that the <em>Borealis</em> is missing from its loading dock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> confirms the Combine Invasion has already happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a>'s</em> timeline.

It ends with GLaDOS telling the bots "you saved science!" and the robots starting dancing with joy as the very upbeat electro song "Robots FTW" starts playing. How did the robots save science?

Just to twist the knife further, the robots get blown up by GLaDOS due to being made obsolete, the happy music <em>still</em> plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">because the robots only cared about science</a>, so it was a success to them, and the <em>Peer Review</em> DLC reveals all those humans died off in less than a week.
</li></ul></li><li> Depends a little bit on your interpretation of the epilogue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>. If you think/support Luke coming home, and Tears' tears being from joy, then you win. If you support Asch coming home, and Tears' tears being from the realization that she'll never again see the man she loved, then this fits it pretty well. Either way, though, Natalia has lost someone close to her. You <em>can</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> and choose to believe the person who came back was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge">Split-Personality Merge</a> of Luke and Asch, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">either</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueThreesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueThreesome">which</a> leaves the ending happy but complicated. And while Van's plan of wanting to destroy the world and every single person alive (to replace them with Replica to take their place and hence prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">the Score's predetermined end of the world</a>) has been thwarted, the Planet Storm has been stopped, meaning that any fonic arts are growing weaker and will likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">cease to exist soon</a>, leaving the inhabitants, who are somewhat reliant on fonic arts for various machinery and similar to be completely useless... until they perhaps find a substitute, which could take years, if not decades or centuries.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne2TheFallOfMaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne2TheFallOfMaxPayne">Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</a></em>, Max lays in the destroyed Inner Circle manor and mentions a dream about his dead wife, who is dead but "that was alright". But the closest thing he had to a <em>living</em> spouse/girlfriend/what have you is dead, and anyone who can explain anything is dead including the extremely powerful Alfred Woden, who had connections to senators. His death, and the death of Detective Winterson are going to be in all likelihood put squarely on Max's shoulders. So not only is he going to be a scapegoat for the death of these powerful people, but also justly prosecuted for the death of a detective with a <em>blind son</em>, who is now an <em>orphan</em>. An Ex-Cop is going to be sent to jail, and we all know how well they go over there. This was probably intentional given the narrative, but it's something of a miracle that a sequel was produced at all that did not involve Max getting shanked to death in the first thirty minutes. If you finish the game on the hardest difficulty, the final Noir cutscene ends with Mona waking up, implying that this could be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>, but the third game runs with the "Mona is dead" ending as canon and goes out of its way to point out how unhappy Max was, with or without her.
<ul><li> As for the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne3">Max Payne 3</a></em>, apparently Max managed to talk his way out of any murder charges, but that's about the only way his life didn't completely self-destruct: His career's in ruins, he's slowly killing himself with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">alcohol abuse</a> in an attempt to self-medicate for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">just to add insult to injury</a> he's been forced to move out of New York and into a crummy apartment in New Jersey. Surprisingly, by the end of the game he's actually a little better off: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">He has to go through yet more awful shit to get there</a>, but the bad guys are <em>definitely</em> getting theirs this time and he's at least started the process of getting his life back together.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> ends with the corrupted world being destroyed by a benevolent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, and then cuts to total blackness. However, you can still walk around in it, and you soon discover that everyone made it out alive. You can talk to the other characters, who are apparently right there with you, and most of them seem relieved that they no longer have to live in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack of a world</a>. However, given the fact that you're all in a black void, and the <em>world was just destroyed</em>, you all may very well be <em>floating through space</em>. Plus, nothing can change the fact that Lucas's Mother and Brother are dead.
</li><li> All the cheeriness from the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin 3</a></em> fizzles away when you realize that even though Olimar makes it off the planet alive, he still failed his mission, left his partners to die, and ultimately screwed over his employer. In short, it's a happy ending for Koppai, but not for Hocotate.
</li><li> The first ending to the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> mildly fits this trope, as the ending was intended to be bittersweet either way. The final cut-scene shows Sora and Mickey sealing the door to (then referred to as) Kingdom Hearts with Riku's help, and Sora has a sort of spiritual talk with love-interest Kairi, desperately getting out that he will indeed find his way back to her somehow, before they are symbolically and spiritually separated as the fragments of worlds realign to their original places, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">Sora</a> has saved the universe! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> sets in when one realizes that a defenseless best friend Riku and King Mickey have been trapped permanently in a dimension populated entirely by an army of Heartless monsters, and that Sora and the party are either in some zero-space between worlds (since they were not restored to their "proper homes" as the end montage shows for everyone else, even making a point of showing Kairi alone on the island), or at worst, since their final showdown was on a patchwork planet made up of what was left of the worlds devoured by Heartless, they may have been left in cold, dark space to die without a planetary body to sit on, and their spaceship, made up of the old barriers between worlds? Yeah, that barrier has been restored, presumably with their spaceship. This ending disturbed the American representatives at Disney so much that they made Square tack on a game-footage Coda to the end of the stunning FMV ending, signaling that Sora and co. may not be home, but they're at least alive and "looking for Riku and the King" implying they too survived.
</li><li> By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em> is over most of the world's population is dead or worse. The ending focuses on the fact that you've saved Elly and taken care of the forces that'd been working against you, but does it really matter at that point?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>'s original ending caused more than a little backlash among fans for various reasons, but sticking to just this trope:
<ul><li> The Mass Relay network is destroyed. This method of faster-than-light travel is absolutely essential to galactic civilization. There's no indication that the technology or knowledge exists to repair or replace relays, and it's treated as something of a surprise earlier in the trilogy that a since-extinct race was able to build their own relay. Without them, galactic civilization as the player has experienced it for three games is essentially destroyed.
</li><li> A DLC for the second game shows that when a Mass Relay is destroyed (by crashing a giant asteroid into one), it releases energy comparable to a supernova, and also destroys the star system it occupies. The method used to destroy the entire network in <em>Mass Effect 3</em> gives no indication that it avoids this side effect, so on top of civilization being destroyed, it also looks like the trillions of people living in systems with relays die immediately.
</li><li> The player's companions seemingly survive the initial event, but wind up stranded on an apparently uninhabited planet. In addition, only three (seemingly randomly chosen) characters are definitively shown to survive. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3sp5i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3sp5i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3sp5i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And given how biochemistry works in <em>Mass Effect</em>, even if everyone survived, either two of your companions are now doomed to starve to death, or everyone but those two are going to starve.</span>
</li><li> One of the three endings, Destroy, kills every robotic character in the galaxy, on top of destroying the Relay network and maybe destroying star systems with relays.
</li><li> The so-called "best" ending Synthesis, does a poor job of explaining why it should be considered the best. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note43tb3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note43tb3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note43tb3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The clearest indication to this effect is the rather meta fact that it is simply the most difficult to unlock.</span> Supposedly somehow fusing organic and inorganic life into one greater whole — involuntarily, at that — the only actual effect it is shown to have is to cover organisms in a glowing green circuitry pattern and make their eyes (if they have them) glow green.
</li><li> To BioWare's credit, the free Extended Cut DLC, which extends the ending cinemas, addresses at least these issues, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retconning</a> it so the Relay system is only damaged, not destroyed, definitively showing it can be repaired, and including scenes showing civilization rebuilding after the war. However "Destroy" is confirmed to wipe out the Geth and kill Edi (who is added to the montage of fallen comrades). Futhermore synthesis is apparently shown granting husks sentience. The horrific implications of Cannibals, Banshees and <em>worse</em> abominations being made self-aware didn't escape fans.
</li><li> Two of the endings are also esoteric in that the message is that synthetic and organic life are (somehow, in some vaguely-defined way) utterly incompatible and will inevitably try to destroy each other for poorly-defined reasons, and that this can only be resolved by implementing a galaxy-wide Final Solution of some variety that inevitably involves either obliterating <em>all</em> synthetic life without exception or forcibly apply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation">Unwilling Roboticisation</a> to <em>all</em> organic and synthetic life against their will. Both of these completely break the Aesop of every single interaction you have with synthetic allies. (The Control ending avoids this problem, since it only affects the hostile Reapers.)
</li><li> In Synthesis and Destroy, the Citadel is also shown exploding, with the Presidium, the structural core of the station, collapsing. Through inference of its holding station instead of orbiting when the Reapers brought it to Earth, the billion-ton ward arms would be falling Earthward and possibly causing five extinction event impacts. The Extended Cut changes this into having the Citadel instead look like it should be condemned and dismantled, with holes in the Wards' bases, and a huge chunk out of the Presidium (which again is the structural core of the station). Control averts this.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, a City Elf Warden can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> this trope at the very end, after using their new status as hero to grant the alienage a bann to represent them at court. Your father is thrilled that humans are praising an elf as their hero, while the City Elf PC can cynically reply that it's only a matter of time before they start treating elves like crap again. A Mage Warden also can say as much to their mentor regarding mages. Both turn out to be right.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>,</em> a player who chooses to aid elven rights activist Briala co-rule Orlais with Gaspard or Celene is presented as a happy end to the civil war for elves. Reuniting Briala with Celene is especially presented as the "ideal" happy ending for all parties. However, a lot of players note that both outcomes look shaky and short-lived at best, since Briala's power lasts only as long as Gaspard is alive <em>and</em> under her thumb, or her relationship with Celene continues to go well, since Celene still has <em>all</em> the power and hasn't hesitated to use it to screw over Briala and the elves before. Basically, despite the game framing Briala co-ruling with Gaspard or Celene as a happy ending for elves, many players are waiting for the other shoe to drop.
</li><li> Even when you take helping elves out of the equation, those who've read <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMaskedEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMaskedEmpire">The Masked Empire</a></em> feel that the game resenting the reconciliation between Celene and Briala as the most ideal happy ending to the whole Orlesian Civil War as this. While the game treats the reunion as a heartwarming example of love triumphing over hard feelings, those who've read the book know <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how toxic, imbalanced, and even abusive their relationship was, and how this "reunion" doesn't address the power imbalance that allowed Celene to hurt Briala as badly as she did.</span> Many players don't see it as a heartwarming reunion so much as convincing an angry, emotionally vulnerable abuse victim to go back to her abuser.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> has two endings: depending on who you choose to deal the final blow to the final boss. Chrom's version is generally considered to be one of these by most players, as it merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">seals Grima away for another thousand years</a>, meaning that while the main characters get to live their lives happily, Grima will one day return to terrorise the world again and to the protagonists that's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome">Somebody Else's Problem</a>. The Avatar's ending kills Grima permanently, seemingly at the cost of the Avatar's life, which would make it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>... were it not for the fact that the Avatar is revealed to have survived. As such, since the latter is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> with no drawbacks, most players consider the first ending choice pointless.
</li><li> The story mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemWarriors">Fire Emblem Warriors</a></em> ends with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">Original Generation</a> twins being crowned co-Regents in the ruins of Aytolis castle, having defeated Velezark and sending the many heroes back to their own realms. Except the twins committed a character-flaw-driven mistake, the sort most <em>Fire Emblem</em> Lords learn to overcome, in the last three chapters of the game, and many people would argue that it's indicative of poor priorities for a ruler. Further, the neighboring kingdom of Gristonne is now completely lacking a royal family and any sort of armed forces. Finally, with what can be learned about Aytolisian succession, both twins are going to have firstborns with an equal claim, making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> and civil war all but certain. Small wonder the final cutscene doesn't actually address the plot's aftermath at all.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">best ending</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaPortable">Puella Magi Madoka Magica Portable</a></em> has Madoka successfully avoid a contract while the other four girls defeat Walpurgisnacht. The story then ends with the girls having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>-laden tea party, happily smiling and joking at each other. However, since Madoka didn't make a contract, millions of girls are still dying of despair, humankind is still plagued by witches, and the main characters are probably going to all die in a few years after their Soul Gems start to run dry.
</li><li> In-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StrongBadsCoolGameForAttractivePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StrongBadsCoolGameForAttractivePeople">Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People</a></em>, everyone complains about Strong Bad's ending for <em>Dangeresque 3</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToTheMoon">To the Moon</a></em> ends with Johnny fulfilling his wish of going to the Moon with the love of his life, River. But... it's all a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream">Dying Dream</a>, Johnny's twin brother, Joey, remained dead in the real world for most of Johnny's life, the real Johnny dies without knowing what his wife, River, was trying to tell him, while the real River died knowing Johnny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFirstMeeting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFirstMeeting">never remembered his first meeting with her</a>, something she was desperately trying him to do so for most of her life. The whole uplifting ending never happened in reality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transistor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transistor">Transistor</a></em> ends with Red finally stopping the Process, but not before all of Cloudbank and its citizens have been processed. At this point, she has the power to remake the city however she wants, but instead chooses to return to the man in the Transistor's body and kill herself with it. But then the credits sequence starts getting surprisingly upbeat until it's revealed that Red killing herself with the Transistor resulted in her getting processed as well, and she can spend the rest of her life with the man in the Transistor in the Country. However, like Bastion, it's implied the game's events will repeat themselves inside the Transistor world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion">Bastion</a>'s</em> Restoration ending, which hits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> on the entire plot and goes back to before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">the Calamity</a> happened. However, it's heavily implied (especially in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, where Rucks starts having moments of deja vu during his narration) that history will simply repeat itself and the Calamity will just be triggered again, trapping everyone in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> until the Kid chooses not to reset everything.
</li><li> Parodied with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImOK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImOK">I'm O.K</a></em>, a response to Jack Thompson's "Modest Video Game Proposal" featuring a vengeful father out to slaughter video gamers and devs over the death of his son. After gorily massacring a multitude of bystanders (including children. Many, many children,) industry employees, and eventually destroying the building E3 is hosted in, the game gives a generic "Congratulations! You killed every game designer in the world! America is saved!" ending.
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a></em> with its add-on <em>Tribunal</em>. Okay, "the false gods" are gone, which is represented as a good thing. However, those "false" gods were the beings which essentially created and shaped Dunmer society as it is, and cared about the Dunmer people. And the "true" gods are Daedra, who are notorious for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>, petty vengefulness and the fact that their idea of good and righteous Dunmer society is tribalism. Not to mention the entire big floating rock debacle which led Morrowind to a slight local apocalypse. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em> confirms that the aftermath of <em>Morrowind</em> did indeed result in the near complete destruction of Dunmer civilization.
</li><li> Discussed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> The ending to the main questline seems at first glance to be a positive one. After all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestroyerDeity">Alduin</a> is defeated, the dragons are now somewhat pacified and following the Way of the Voice, and the Skyrim civil war is either finished or at least at a ceasefire. However, as Paarthurnax says, the Dragonborn's attempt to defeat Alduin might have prevented him from destroying the world... or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">it might have sped up the ending of the world</a>, since it is Alduin's role to be the one who eats the world so it may be reborn, and all that Alduin desired in this timeline was to <em>rule</em> the world. In defeating him, the player may have simply put him back in his place as the World-Eater.
</li><li> Also, depending on how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> itself was ended, this could be the case. If the Stormcloaks win, then the Empire is shattered apart, leaving the continent at risk of being once more invaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">the Thalmor</a>. If the Empire wins, however, Skyrim is still devastated by the war and the worship of Talos will be further suppressed, which will further weaken the metaphysical forces holding the world together, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">which is what the Thalmor want</a>.

The last ending, however, is decisively esoteric: Johnny gains the answers to all questions in the universe and just stands there for a bit, going "Ooooh!" with an incredibly satisfied smile, before the credits roll.
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SandsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SandsOfDestruction">Sands of Destruction</a></em> is unambiguously meant to be happy: Kyrie has control of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandIsWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandIsWater">Sand Sea</a> is now filled with water (and therefore much more livable) and it's no longer trying to swallow all the continents to help end the world, humans are no longer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">oppressed by Ferals</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">best of all</a>, he and Morte (who no longer wishes to end the world) are a happy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>. Well, great, except the epilogue doesn't show <em>any</em> Ferals except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheLeadsGetAHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheLeadsGetAHappyEnding">Taupy, Rhi'a, and Naja</a>. What happened to the rest? Rhi'a is seen chasing after a house cat who resembles Felis Rex, so perhaps they've been turned into ordinary animals - a fitting end to those who were oppressive, sure, but the game points out that Ferals are as diverse as humans in personality; some are cruel and some are kind. On top of that, the only reason Kyrie has control of his powers is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>, and he and Morte are teenagers: what happens if they break up, like so many other teenagers tend to do? Worse yet, the Crimson Sun gave Morte the Destruct Code that controls Kyrie's powers, and the only reason she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">no longer interested in ending the world</a> is because Kyrie is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthLivingFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthLivingFor">Worth Living For</a>; she's still shown to be temperamental and prone to acting before she thinks. So if Kyrie ever falls out of love and breaks her heart, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalCosmicTemperTantrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalCosmicTemperTantrum">likely to end the world in a fit of anger</a> because she now knows <em>exactly</em> how to do it, and he'd be powerless to stop her. Oops.
</li><li> Not in regards to the actual ending, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> for completing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Side Quest</a> the player gets a "Bonus Scene", a little animation that plays out one of three ways, "Boo" which is the worst ending with no prize, "Bingo!" which is the good ending and a small prize, and "Jackpot!" which of the best ending with the best prize. However one scene shows the demon cat Jibanyan trying to help the kappa Walkappa up the mountain, with the "Boo" ending being they both fall off and the "Bingo!" ending being Jibanyan helps Walkappa up the peak. For some reason, the "Jackpot!" ending has Walkappa missing Jibanyan's hand and falling down the mountain, with Jibanyan just standing there and shrugging in confusion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em> ends with the war being won, the bad guys being defeated, and the good guys going back to their rescued hometown to live their peaceful lives. That's all well and good for <em>them</em>, but it doesn't acknowledge the fallout: one, it's possible to replicate Valkyria powers artificially. Max's attempt was blown up, but it <em>worked</em>, and it's not-so-subtly implied that it failed primarily because Valkyria are exclusively female and Maximillian is a man. Sure, <em>Max</em> is gone, but everyone who <em>produced</em> that technology is still in the Empire. Two, Alicia proves that any random orphaned little girl may be descended from the Valkyrur, and practically <em>any</em> non-Darcsen woman in Europa could easily claim the same thing: the entire game is about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a> and some people will do anything to control the power of the Valkyria, and the most viable potential Valkyria are an extremely vulnerable demographic that have to be <em>nearly dead</em> to awaken their powers. And three, the Princess of Gallia just openly declared that the entire history of Gallia is a big fat lie and she is a Darcsen, a minority race that is widely reviled. The sequel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFridgeHorror">examines the consequences of most of these</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles4">Valkyria Chronicles 4</a></em> picks up the slack on what it doesn't cover, too. Specifically, the empire has known for a while anyone can have Valkyrur blood and has been going a massive amount of genealogy research to narrow down possible candidates. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Federation's guilty of exactly the same thing, too.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> in general is quite positive, but the Amalgamates returning to their families to live happily seems out of place, considering the horror attached to their reveal and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> they experience.
</li><li> Flowey/Asriel's fate (losing his physical body and reverting to an emotionless flower creature) rubs a lot of people the wrong way, and somewhat diminishes what would otherwise be a literally perfect ending for everyone. Many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic">Fix Fic</a> involves finding a way to get Asriel his soul back.
</li><li> A similar, but far more subtle and subjective case could be made about Sans. He explicitly states at the end of a No Mercy route that it doesn't matter to him if he makes it to the surface or not - he's been so conditioned by Flowey/the player's continuous resets that making it would just feel like a false hope being dangled in front of his face. The question here is a matter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a>; was he only saying that because he was at his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a>, and has enough faith in the protagonist/player by the end of a pacifist route to enjoy life on the surface like everyone else, or will he spend the rest of his days just as depressed and nihilistic as before?

If you disrupt the ritual and allow The Darkness to devour Alexander, Daniel is allowed to go free and presumably pursue a normal life... despite the countless people he helped to torture and murder as part of Alexander's plans. More closely fitting to this trope is the alternative, where you send Agrippa's head through the portal. Alexander and Daniel are both devoured by The Darkness, but Agrippa is apparently able to somehow rescue Daniel and draw him through to another dimension... which brings with it the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> of how this is supposed to save Daniel from being tracked down by The Darkness again, which is explicitly mentioned in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> document as being why Alexander was going to simply abandon Daniel when the ritual was complete.

As he argues with his only companion, a previously uploaded engineer who created the ARK, about this fate, the imperfect computer she's been forced to use to host her consciousness finally overloads and kills her, leaving him completely alone, the last vestige of human sentience, under miles of water on a planet where the surface has been scorched clean. Up above, the duplicates of Simon and Catherine enjoy a happy reunion in the ARK... although how long it'll actually <em>survive</em> is anyone's guess.

As they're reconstructing the protagonists' bodies to give them a final chance at a free life, the Pods speculate that since they're going to be using a complete image of each android's personality at the time of their death, it's entirely possible they'll just repeat the same mistakes that lead to their end in the first place. However, they conclude that they feel the androids deserve that chance, and the fact they themselves have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming">grown beyond their programming</a> enough to contemplate and make said decision is proof the androids can avoid past mistakes.
</li><li> There's a strange variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>. The regular ending has two choices: You sacrifice yourself to save the wasteland by activating Project Purity (which will flood the activation room with radiation), or you get Lyons to sacrifice herself for you. The ultimate effect is the same, but the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">chews you out</a> if you choose to sacrifice Lyons. Thing is, you don't even have the <em>option</em> of say, sending Fawkes, the <strong>explicitly radiation-immune</strong> Super Mutant to do it, or Charon, the ghoul who's <strong>healed by radiation</strong>, using a robot, surviving by use of the copious amounts of Rad-Away you've most likely accumulated over your journey, or even poking the activation buttons with a pole from far away.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> quest <em>The Brink of Extinction</em> has you saving the TzHaar race from going extinct. You eventually defeat the villain responsible and solve the cause of the problem. However, if you go back to the villain after the quest to confront him about the reasons for his actions, he reveals that the TzHaar are slowly growing weaker with every generation due to losing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">racial memories</a> because they were never intended to reproduce. By taking away their ability to reproduce, he was trying to force them to return to the Elder Kiln so they could be properly reborn as intended. So although you have saved the TzHaar in the short term, you have doomed them in the long run, although the situation is not quite as bad as it was before because now the TzHaar are aware that their bodies need to be returned to the sacred lava after death so their souls can be freed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>, and the Ga'Al (TzHaar born <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankSlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankSlate">without any memories</a>) are no longer being killed on birth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance">Resistance 3</a></em> seems to end on a pretty triumphant note, with the Chimeran war finally over after almost 20 years with their wormhole to their homeworld closed and humanity rising up to finally eliminate the last of them. The problem is humanity, after all that fighting, has been reduced by 90%, either killed or converted by the Chimera. A population decline like that would be borderline impossible to recover from, especially with the loss of so many people who would be necessary for things like labor, industrial work, science, medicine, etc. Human society has essentially regressed by several hundred years. And that's not even getting into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileTerraforming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileTerraforming">Hostile Terraforming</a> that the Chimera have done to Earth, trying to plunge it into a new ice age. An act that, even if it has been undone by the loss of their terraforming machines, has likely lead to the extinction of countless species and permanently damaged the Earth's ecology.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rampage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rampage">Rampage: Total Destruction</a></em>'s ending is a likely deliberate example meant to be funny. The monsters destroy several cities and kill and eat countless people, but the company that accidentally created the monsters makes a ton of money selling their mutagenic soda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">due to the free publicity that the monsters give them</a>, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">everything is alright</a>.

The actions that trigger this ending involving <em>acting</em> in the role of Silent Hill's executioner and tormentor (by deliberately causing pain and suffering to those who broke Silent Hill's laws), which means that the transformation could just as easily be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Silent Hill's idea of "rewarding" Alex</a>. Furthermore, given that Alex by the end of the game has been left mentally scarred and permanently crippled, with all of his paperwork lost in the now-haunted Shepherd's Glen, he doesn't really have a life left worth living amongst humanity. Becoming a monstrous avenger of evil and tormenting the wicked for all eternity is an honest step <em>up</em> from where he'd otherwise be left as. Furthermore, it fits with the recurring motif of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers">Sins of Our Fathers</a> present in the game; the machinations of the Shepherd's Glen cult made monsters out of all of Alex's peers... and end up making a monster of Alex, too.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsPhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsPhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a></em> story's ends happily, the whole thing being a successful attempt by the British government to alter memories and brainwash people on a large scale goes unremarked on, despite the potentially horrific ramifications for the world's future. The sheer <em>amount</em> of trauma many characters go through can also prevent the ending from feeling as happy as it's presented, especially concerning Espella, Darklaw, and Jean.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LifeIsStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LifeIsStrange">Life Is Strange</a>:</em> While both endings are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">bittersweet</a> to varying degrees, the ending in which Max chooses to allow Chloe to die to stop the storm from destroying the town seems to be intended as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranchFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranchFavoritism">"better" of the two</a> and is definitely the one the developers put more effort into. Players on the other hand often have a great deal of criticisms of it, pointing out what while more characters explicitly survive in this ending and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist">Jefferson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">Nathan</a> are busted, as far as anyone can tell, Arcadia Bay is still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingTown">Dying Town</a> run like a fiefdom by Nathan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">amoral real estate mogul</a> father, Chloe dies alone and unloved at her absolute lowest point (with the last words she ever hears being "Nobody would miss your punk ass!"), Nathan would likely get off very light for her murder due to a combination of turning in Jefferson and his father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">influence over the cops</a>, and Max has lost the love of her life, may be traumatized for years, and has essentially learned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">heartwarming message</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">going on her adventure in the first place made everything worse</a>.
</li><li> Applied to the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodEater">God Eater</a></em> games. It was made very clear that everything the titular God Eaters did was a stopgap, humanity was running out of resources in this arms race, and eventually an Aragami would form that was simply too powerful to stop and this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo">Grey Goo</a> variant would reach its logical conclusion. The third game finally tackled this with an ending that conclusively ruled out an apocalypse, though humanity still had a lot of rebuilding to do.

The good ending for Diamond World has the heroine and Toma starting a romantic relationship, after having cleared up a misunderstanding and revealing that they've been in love with each other for a long time. Many (Western) players didn't find this a happy ending, at all, because it meant Toma's actions of drugging and imprisoning the heroine out of some twisted sense of protection and jealousy were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">completely ignored</a>. But <em>Amnesia: Later</em> reveals that the good ending isn't done, and that Toma hesitates to actually have a relationship with her <em>because</em> he hasn't atoned for his actions. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">the other Amnesia games haven't received a localization yet</a>, meaning many (Western) players don't know this.

<ul><li> It ends with the protagonists refusing to give in to despair and surviving, but the world outside is post-apocalyptic, making it unlikely they'd even survive for long. Furthermore, 15 friends (considered humanity's brightest hopes) killed each other until only 6 remained, showing the rest of the world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">how far the world's best had fallen</a>.

At the end, the survivors wake up with their memories but, for whatever reason, they remain sane and stay behind on Jabberwock Island to restore their comatose friends. If you think that they succeed, as Makoto said they would this is pretty decent. If you think the opposite, then the survivors are doomed to waste the rest of their lives tending to their braindead loved ones. Even then, there's the problematic fact that the students are known to the world as world-destroying terrorists and have most likely no surviving loved ones and that Makoto and his allies are likely going to end up in hot water with the Future Foundation over what happened. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3TheEndOfHopesPeakHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3TheEndOfHopesPeakHighSchool">Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School</a></em> is set to at least address this and, judging off the promo image, it looks like the part with Makoto unfortunately came true.

It's implied she's going to have a loooong life... living in a literal bubble of denial with a faulty computer pretending (badly) to be her dead husband along with an imaginary child, all this after being the character defined by such things as detesting the way some people live in their own make-believe worlds and forcing herself out of her clock tower home and back into reality prior the start of the story for the sake of finding happiness. Yay? More than anything, it comes across as the author's half-hearted attempt to be rid of her while also leaving her "happy" enough not to completely disappoint the fans who were hoping for a happy ending for her.

The author would have you believe that this is the best outcome for all parties, but a more critical examination can point out the problems with this. Makoto has just thrown away his very good and stable job to be with her, which he totally didn't need to do because he is marrying into the family anyway. He has savings, but those things aren't limitless and he will eventually run out, which has led many fans to believe that he will sponge off of his very wealthy parents and avoid getting a job so he can be with Miharu all the time. Miharu, meanwhile, has no stable goal in life (besides shopping, eating, and dating) and no job skills besides a waitress, which is a mediocre pay at best. Neither of them shows any real chemistry with one another besides heavy petting and sexting, and they avoid actual, meaningful communication like the plague. They are co-dependent to a fault and almost consciously refuse to see the consequences of their actions towards one another and others.

The worst cases of this trope as it pertains to grounded videos are the "X Gets Executed" videos, which are centered around a troublesome character being killed for their past misdemeanors with their death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">being celebrated</a> (by their families, friends, and even the entire town) both before, during, and after the execution.

Despite having such a demented premise and having everyone involved clearly crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>, this is presented as a good ending for everyone involved.

<ul><li> The ending for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> episode "Tree Trunks" has the eponymous character of the episode, an elderly, grandmotherly elephant, finally eating the crystal apple she traveled alongside Finn and Jake, who kept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter">putting their lives on the line</a> to prevent any of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">many monsters in the Evil Forest</a> from harming her. As soon as Finn asks her how it tastes, she suddenly explodes. However, after a few seconds of Finn and Jake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">staring blankly</a>, it soon cuts to Tree Trunks merrily dancing along inside the crystal. Interestingly enough, that scene following Finn and Jake's reaction was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executive demand to soften the blow of the otherwise grim ending</a>, which also gave the writers the ability to bring back the character in the season two episode "Crystals Have Power", when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrewdriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrewdriver">we learn what really happened to Tree Trunks</a>.

They focus on someone named Clare, who is leaving the school and the city because of her dad losing his job. As Clare constantly tries to narrate her thoughts in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenDrama">Teen Drama</a>-esque fashion, Gumball and Darwin constantly butt in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">just to remain in focus of the episode</a>.

Ben managed to settle the war by accidentally destroying one of their most valued statues, pitting them against him, and ending the war for good. The episode ends with the girl comically telling Ben that she and the rest of the planet hates him, and that her life is even worse now as her work hours are longer. However, she finds a pile of treasure that Kevin and Argit left behind as part of their war profits and the episode closes with her celebrating. While the war has stopped, it doesn't solve anything. Ben's discussions with the military leaders showed them to be incessantly corrupt Generals who refused to see reason, and even admitted to using the war as a convenient excuse to blame their social and economic problems on. The girl and other civilians had to work long hours producing weapons and had a hard time finding homes. While she gets to keep the money from Kevin and Argit's war-mongering, there are still countless other civilians who're still suffering from poverty because of the pointless draining war.

Star manages to accomplish her goal of destroying magic and stopping Mina, while also saving Tom and still getting together with Marco thanks to all the dimensions being merged into one amalgam world. Happy ending, right? Not quite. Many fans view Star as having committed <em>genocide</em> on all the inhabitants of the Magic Realm, as well as any beings dependent on magic to survive: we're explicitly shown some of these deaths during the fact, while others have lifeless bodies shown after the events, and some that perish offscreen (such as Glossaryck and Hekapoo) directly tell Star that they'd die if she succeeds. All this is treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">the perfect solution</a>. And while she never intended for it, the union of various dimensions caused a large amount of culture shock for everyone, with the humans of Echo Creek and the various creatures of Mewni adapting poorly to elements of each others' worlds. Even if everyone can eventually adapt to this, Mina is still around, declaring that she'll never lose so long as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsThereIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsThereIsEvil">there are people with similar ideas</a>. Combine that with supplementary material stating there's a contingent of villains still out there that are undefeatable without magic, and you have some very troubling implications for the future. The only ones who really got a good ending were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheLeadsGetAHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheLeadsGetAHappyEnding">Star and Marco</a>.
</li><li> Such is often the case with each season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>, but the final episode of its fifth season "The Final Wreck-ening" is easily the most infamous example of this. It follows Mike and Zoey in their final run for the million-dollar prize, with Mike finally overcoming his evil alter-ego Mal by means of a reset button pressed inside his head, erasing Mal and his other personalities. Mike and Zoey are happily reunited with their first kiss before finally winning the million which they intend to split between each other. However, prior to the challenge no less than eight eliminated contestants are sent floating away in fart-filled balloons carelessly left to drift away by Chris, with their fates remaining unexplained as they are last seen blowing into the sky. Mike and Zoey are then sent drifting with their friends Gwen and Cameron as the entire island sinks due to Chris and Chef's land drill, while Heather and Alejandro are chased by sharks. The episode ends with Owen water skiing proclaiming it to have been the greatest finale ever; the fandom disagreed.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em> episode entitled "Madame Blueberry" is surprisingly shocking and rather brutal, considering how light-hearted the series was at this point. The episode details how the titular character goes around buying things in hoping that it won't make her feel sad anymore. However by the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">she learns that she just needs to be thankful for what she has already</a>, her own house gets destroyed, all of her possessions become worthless, and she herself becomes homeless. Though the trope may be downplayed if you take the book "Madame Blueberry Learns to Be Thankful", wherein Bob and Larry help rebuild the treehouse after the events of said episode, to be a canon follow-up to the episode.
