Expect a dramatic shot of the crutch being thrown away, or the discarded wheelchair clattering its way to oblivion.
</p><p>Explanations for this tend to fall into five varieties:
</p><p></p><ul><li> 1. The character can override the disability through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a>. This is most believable if it's a short-lived emergency override of a disability that makes normal physical activity very painful and difficult, but not outright impossible.
<ul><li> 1a. The disability was psychosomatic in the first place, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a> was all that was ever needed to cure it.
</li></ul></li><li> 2. The disability was temporary, and rest and/or medical treatment have healed it in time for the plot-relevant moment.
</li><li> 3. The character was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability">only feigning the disability</a> in the first place, or exaggerating their impediment.
</li><li> 4. The otherwise incurable disability was miraculously cured through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention">Divine Intervention</a> or by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>.
</li><li> 5. The disability could just disappear for no reason at all, possibly as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> or as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>.

The heroine's brother is a Contractor who uses a wheelchair as part of his Remuneration. Typically of this trope, he suddenly rises from his wheelchair at a plot-important moment.

A large part of his character before this moment consisted in him re-learning to ride a horse without the use of his legs.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with in episode 23. For the last eighteen months, Princess Lemrina has been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">impersonating her comatose sister Asseylum to rally the Vers Knights</span>. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheelchairWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheelchairWoobie">her own disability</a>, she has to pretend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asseylum had been paralyzed during the events of Episode 12 - not <em>completely</em> unlikely, since she was shot in the back and it <em>could</em> have have damaged her back and/or spine</span>. So when the <em>real</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asseylum</span>, having woken up without having lost her mobility, delivers a speech to the Knights that culminates in her stepping right out of her wheelchair, it appears to be this, when really she'd never even pretended to be paralyzed.
</li><li> Played with similarly in a previous episode where Lemrina appears to do this, only to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">disengage her camouflage and reveal herself to be Asseylum, having just tricked Slaine into revealing his plans to subjugate Earth</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In episode 12 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/WalkureRomanze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/WalkureRomanze">Walkure Romanze</a></em>, Mirielle, who was wheelchair bound due to a horse riding accident, manages to regain the use of her legs after watching her sister Noel fight in the tournament. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While Noel loses the match, she's not too upset about it in light of her sister being able to walk again.</span>

Yuna loses her ability to taste foods, Fu loses <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eyesight in her left eye</span>, Itsuki loses <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her ability to speak</span>, and Togo loses her ability to hear in one ear. Later in the series it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Togo was a Hero who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotTheCall">Forgot the Call</a>, explaining why she is wheelchair bound.</span> In the last two episodes both Karin and Yuna <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">become seriously disabled, becoming blind-deaf on top of losing ability in their limbs (Yuna even ends up in a catatonic state).</span> In the end though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everyone's disabilities are fixed, or rather, the abilities they sacrificed are returned</span>.
</li><li> A rather dark usage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Cross Ange</a></em>: Ange's sister Sylvia injured herself in a horse-riding accident when she was young, and as a result is paraplegic. In the final episodes, however, Ange guesses that the disability isn't physical and that Sylvia's used her injury as an excuse to rely on others, and gets her sister to start walking again to tie into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about standing on your own. The thing is, she does this by threatening her sister's life, forcing her to walk out of sheer terror that she was about to be killed. Also, it's glossed over how her legs would be capable of supporting her if she hadn't used them in years.
</li><li> Subverted in the Izaya Orihara spin-off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>. Due to sustained injuries after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his final fight with Shizuo, Izaya's arms are weak and using his legs causes him pain, so for the most part he is confined to a wheelchair</span>. As it turns out, these are psychosomatic injuries and if he took therapy, he could move around how he used to. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Izaya refuses therapy and claims that it is his 'punishment'. However, it is implied PTSD is the cause behind this decision</span>.

However, she soon learns that it's sadly not possible - the damage to her spine is too severe - and adjusts to life in a wheelchair. A note by the author at the end of the book explains that she was concerned about the original novel's use of this trope and the message it gives to children. This suggests that, even if Wilson had gone down the route of having Katy learn to walk again, she would have presented it as a long, hard struggle with no guarantees of a complete recovery.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SevenDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SevenDays">Seven Days</a></em>: Wheelchair-bound Dr. Ballard is given a chip that allows him to walk again. Unfortunately, said chip contains an alien consciousness that makes him homicidal, forcing Parker to back-step to prevent him from receiving the implant, leaving him in the wheelchair.
</li><li> In the Season 1 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>, Fitz nearly drowns and suffers brain damage due to oxygen deprivation. In this episode, and for the first few episodes of Season 2, it's repeatedly stated that he'll probably never be the same again, and it's shown that he's lost a lot of mobility in his hands, can no longer speak coherently, suffers from violent outbursts and hallucinations, and seems to have lost much of his knowledge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">engineering and physics</a> that made him a valuable member of the team. He makes a slow recovery over the course of the first half of Season 2, and while his progress is quite amazing considering earlier fears he would literally be rendered catatonic and the fact that he'd made almost no improvement in the first few months after his injury, it's still broadly believable. However, after the mid-season break it's only rarely brought up and never shown to hamper him any more, and notably the whole "life changing injury" story for his character is <em>never once mentioned</em> in the whole of Season 3, when he's fully functional once again and any differences from his Season 1 characterisation are attributed to the emotional trauma he's suffered. In-universe it's treated as an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a> with a dash of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHealing">Hollywood Healing</a>, though the complete lack of follow-up in the latest season suggests that it's been quietly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> along with a few other details from Season 2.

A few episodes later, he starts feeling tingles, but is told it's just psychosomatic. He finally bolts up out of his wheelchair to grab Lavinia when she falls. This is treated somewhat realistically, for a number of reasons:
<ul><li> The 1915 medical technology wasn't sensitive enough to detect his chances of recovery.
</li><li> The doctor is revealed to have known there was a small chance, but didn't want to give false hope, which is consistent with his depiction as medically conservative.

She was said to be "permanently" crippled, accepting the fact that she would be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. But of course this only lasted a few episodes before she dramatically and inexplicably got up from her wheelchair to emphasize that she was in fact literally walking out of Oliver Queen's life. To say this wasn't well-received by fans would be a understatement.

Partly this is due to treatments (of varying degrees of bakedness) that he tries over the course of the series, partly it's due to how much Vicodin/Methadone/Ibuprofen/whatever he happens to be taking at the time.

After getting shot in season one, Johny is later shown to be using a wheelchair and appears to be paraplegic. However, when some man come to kill him, he gets out of his wheelchair and walks out the back door to evade them. It is explained that he was not paralyzed from the gunshot but the injuries were severe enough that he is in considerable pain when he walks so he stays in the wheelchair most of the time. As the series progresses, Johny gets out of the chair more often and walks using a cane. It takes more than a year before he is able to walk without the cane and he is never as physically fit as he was in season one.

But, as pointed out by others, the limp and pain are not constant, and disappear when he is occupied with something dangerous, exciting, or curiosity-inspiring — letting them conclude it's mostly psychosomatic. They are right, and during the first episode it happens more and more often for extended periods until the limp and the cane disappear entirely.

So Spock takes matters into his own hands, risking his own career and Captain Kirk's command to help Captain Pike return to Talos IV, the planet of the obscene craniums. There, Captain Pike can live in a kind of dreamworld for the amusement of the sterile Talosians, but at least he'll be perfectly healthy.

He regains his mobility in the second game after Donovan has him kidnapped and experimented on.

Similar to the Kill Bill example detailed above, Snake's years-long coma gives him muscle atrophy. Despite the doctors apparently trying to maintain his muscle mass, when the hospital he's in is attacked, he can't move and needs to be given drugs to help him recover - however, they don't kick in immediately, and he has to crawl on the floor before they do. However, once Snake is safely out of the hospital, there's a time skip of a week and then he's back to his usual self, having completely recovered from the atrophy (though it's stated he's spent that whole time in <em>constant physical training.</em> Still not realistic, but at least an effort at explanation was made).

After her first trial with Jan Pharris' healing machine, Claire Moon managed to stand up in defiance of her polio. But it only lasts for a few seconds while she dances with Jan in a masquerade ball, before she drops to the floor as the polio swiftly returns.

One of the doctor's old college friends has a Hulk-type power, which is the result of his totally-not-Stephen-Hawking father's experiments to try to cure his own paralysis. His father will involuntarily hulk out too if he gets angry enough. He gets big, muscly, and purple, and falls out of his wheelchair, since he's still paralyzed.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Occurs in Hanna-Barbera's <em>Heidi's Song</em>, when Clara gets out of her in order to defend her pet kitten against a Hawk.
</li><li> Used a couple of times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Krazy Kripples", Christopher Reeve regains the ability to walk (among other things) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">sucking the stem cells out of an embryo</a>.
</li><li> In "Bloody Mary", attending an AA meeting convinces Randy that he is powerless to overcome his drinking problem, and starts using a wheelchair for some reason. When sprayed with the blood of the eponymous Mary, he triumphantly stands up and throws his drink to the ground. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a>, of course, because he was only ever disabled in his hypochondriac mind. When the Vatican claims it wasn't a real miracle, Randy even goes back to acting sick, until the kids have to explain the situation to him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>:
<ul><li> Peggy had to go through this when her muscles had atrophied after being released from her body-cast due to a skydiving accident. In this case she chose to forgo normal physical therapy for Cotton's method, where he purposefully got her angry in order to provoke a response. It was still a long and involved process, though.
</li><li> When Bill was diagnosed with diabetes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoctorJerk">his jerkass of a doctor</a> dismissively showed him a pamphlet of wheelchairs he would need since the disease would affect his legs. Bill defeatedly accepts his fate, but then learns to enjoy life regardless after he meets a basketball player in a wheelchair. Bill at one point subconsciously gets up from his wheelchair without realizing it and discovers that his diabetes had receded, but this gets him mistaken for faking his disability and causes his friendship with his wheelchair bound friends to sour. He feels so guilty that he overindulges in pure sugar so that he could get diabetes again and reunite with his friends, though said friends stop by and tell him to embrace his ability to walk again and that he can still be confident and be the person he wants to be without having to be in a wheelchair for it. Bill celebrates by visiting his doctor and proceeding to give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> before kicking his ass behind closed doors.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fillmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fillmore">Fillmore!</a></em> included a computer game reviewer who was in a wheelchair with both her legs in casts. When Fillmore and Ingrid try to bring her in for questioning about a stolen game system, she flees in the chair - then, when the chair gets stuck on uneven ground, she opens the casts, gets up, and attempts to run away. After being caught and questioned, she haughtily points out, "I never said I couldn't walk. I just prefer not to waste the excess energy." Fillmore is unimpressed: "You let people believe you were <em>seriously injured</em>. You don't just fake a double leg-break!"
<ul><li> Also notable in that while she might have been able to run, she had been faking disability for so long that she only made it a few feet before collapsing from exhaustion.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>: Bonnie flies to Paris to have an affair, and her wheelchair-bound husband Joe finds out.

<ul><li> Another episode taking place during the winter has Joe crash his sled and suddenly regain the ability to walk... and during his celebratory dance his son Kevin accidentally knocks Joe over with a sled and Joe is crippled again.
</li><li> Another has Joe revealing that God told him that he could walk one time. He was saving it for his daughter's wedding, but used it to escape an uncomfortable conversation, instead.
</li><li> Lampshaded in that episode where they rescue Quagmire from a woman who gets a sexual thrill out of torturing him. They confront her and Peter tells Joe that now would be a good time to dramatically get out of his wheelchair.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> by Professor X in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen">Wolverine and the X-Men</a></em>. The first time you see him in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">future</a>, he stands up and runs out of the Cerebro chamber. However, it quickly becomes clear that he is wearing robotic leg braces and he is later shown to be unable to use his legs without them.

<ul><li> Increasingly becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> as new medical procedures restore hearing to the deaf or vision to the blind. Indeed, cochlear implants have become so prevalent that deaf communities are dying out in the United States for lack of new members.
</li><li> An unfortunate belief about ADHD is that people eventually outgrow it. While some people do lose their symptoms upon reaching adulthood, in most cases they just change form, causing restlessness of both body and mind instead of hyperactivity. As a result, the disorder is underdiagnosed in adults.
<ul><li> Similarly, many people have the belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HighFunctioningAutism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HighFunctioningAutism">High-Functioning Autism</a> is something that people eventually outgrow, since those who have it aren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAutism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAutism">stereotypically autistic</a>. However, autistic people remain autistic even in adulthood - they're just better at hiding symptoms in public (called 'masking') than they were when they were younger, and have learned how to better cope with neurotypical environments. The fact that allistic people believe that this trope is both possible and necessary for autistic people has earned considerable ire from both autistic individuals and autism rights advocates, who consider it highly ableist, pointing out that if such a thing <em>was</em> possible, it'd be forced upon autistic individuals under the guise of an "option."
