Well, there are three options. The first is to ignore changes in the source and just keep adapting the story as you always have, hoping that the series won't collapse under the weight of its own contradictions; this is high-risk because there is a point where no amount of editing or rewriting can change what's in front of you. The second option is to try and explain the discrepancies away using the best leaps of logic and (if applicable) technobabble you can, which runs the risk of making your viewers aware of the changes (which is never a good thing). The third option is to just completely blow it off! Just pretend the last change <em>you</em> made never happened and adapt the source as-is. So what if you just took a two by four to the plot? Who cares if your dialogue doesn't make any sense? Send that script out the door, and let the fans deal with it. If you even assume that the fans are smart enough, particularly given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">their age</a>, to notice.

Sometimes they'll even adapt a cultural custom with zero explanation  and nobody in the show will act surprised. The resulting disconnect creates a big giant plot hole and the only recourse of the fan is to just look up the original version, or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">ignore it themselves</a>.

The former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> regularly fell victim to this, which is not surprising given the amounts of censorship and changes usually done to its foreign adaptations.
<ul><li> One particularly infamous instance, referenced in the page quote, occurs in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment">DiC</a> dub of the first season where Mamoru is brainwashed and falls into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCostumeSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCostumeSwitch">Evil Costume Switch</a> version of his alter-ego Endymion. For some reason, the English dub decided to keep his past name the same as his reborn name, which got to be very awkward when he didn't recognize the name "Darien" even though he called himself <em>Prince Darien</em>.
<ul><li> They did it again when the gang gets transported to Crystal Tokyo by Darien's future self, King Endymion. Apparently, "Endymion" was too hard for the dubbers to pronounce, because he introduces himself to the Sailor Guardians with the not-at-all-awkward "Call me... 'King of the Earth'." Serena, surprisingly, is still referred to as Neo-Queen Serenity here.
</li><li> The opposite issue cropped up when the dub was continued by Cloverway. One of the later episodes of <em>SuperS</em> finally mentioned the name "Endymion", which would be fine if not for that the dub had never used that name before, so anyone who was unfamiliar with the original version was not going to know where this name came from all of a sudden.
</li></ul></li><li> Several plotholes popped up because Episode 42, the episode that covered Minako's backstory, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">dropped</a>. This episode showed the team desperately searching for an entrance in their area to the Dark Kingdom, as well as establishing that the sun was slowly being covered by sun spots, heralding the return of Queen Metaria. They find the entrance at the end of the episode, leading directly to their first assault in Episode 44. There was also another scene of Mamoru being brainwashed and Metaria actually possessing his body, thus explaining why it was so hard to get through to him when he fought with Sailor Moon in the last episode. Since all of this is missing from DiC's dub, the Sailor Scouts are just running into the Negaverse with no explanation, making one wonder why they didn't do this before considering how just one episode earlier, they were willing to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> to get Serena inside. There is no explanation for why Sailor Moon's abilities don't work on Mamoru anymore, though Beryl makes a remark that she put a better spell on him (creating a new plot hole — why didn't she just use that spell <em>from the start?</em>). There are also numerous shots of the sun in the last episode of the dub (all shots from the combined 45-46) that show the progression of the sun spots. These are left as random, unexplained images in the dub — they never bothered to explain why they were showing images of the sun getting blacked out. Another confusing moment is the English dub's awkward explanation for how they found the entrance with Episode 42 cut out. They tried to fix that with the claim that 'Central Control' gave Luna and Artemis the information. The problem with that? It was made clear <em>several episodes earlier</em> that Central Control was really just Artemis with a computer.
</li><li> Sailor Mercury's death in Episode 45 originally showed her breaking the illusion device the DD Girls had been using to attack the Guardians. Because Episodes 45-46 were heavily edited to cover up the deaths of the main characters, the DiC dub cut almost the entire sequence, so it appears that the Doom and Gloom Girls just stop using the illusions that had helped them take out two of the Scouts effortlessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry">because it was unfair</a>. Also the deaths of Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Mars were censored as having them held prisoner in the Negaverse. Except Mars being "held prisoner" makes no sense since she kills the last two Doom and Gloom Girls by herself so there was no one to take her to the Negaverse.
</li><li> Another instance cropped up when somebody forgot that the final two episodes of the first season had such alterations made to it. The Japanese version of Episode 46 had a brief scene in the middle of the episode where Mamoru's mental conflict of trying to undo Metaria's brainwashing was shown in his mind as himself in a hospital bed struggling to remember who he was (mirroring his original amnesia over his past before he lost his parents). Usagi, in her school uniform (not as Sailor Moon) appeared and promised she would help him. This scene was, in the DiC dub, used at the end of the episode instead and presented as an event that actually happened, which caused any number of plotholes — such as, why was Darien in the hospital and everyone else from the same fight okay despite everyone suffering grave injury?
</li><li> The DiC dub also provides absolutely no reason why the girls and Darien lose their memories after the climactic battle. This was because they were trying to once again hide the deaths of the main characters, as they had all died after the fight but were resurrected without the memories of the conflict by Usagi's wish to return to a life without war.
</li><li> Not to mention that Usagi/Serena's objecting to become a warrior again while having her memory restored by Luna is more or less meaningless in the dub (true, DiC made it a lot less dramatic, but still), because the events of the first season's last two episodes wouldn't have left such an impact on her if her companions were merely kidnapped and everyone in general survived the battle. Also, during that scene, DiC removed the memories of the Sailor Guardians being killed, but somehow left in Endymion being impaled by Beryl's crystal and Sailor Moon crying over his dead body.
</li><li> In the Makai Tree Arc, DiC changed Ali (Allan) and En's (Ann's) backstory so they were affiliated with the Negaverse and knew Queen Beryl (and that it was apparently her who "advised" them to go after Earth), because apparently having more than one villainous group was too confusing for viewers. That makes little sense when we learn their actual backstories, but even before that is headscratching — in Episode 49 (43 in the DiC dub), Serena shows Darien some pictures of the battle with Beryl to help him regain his memories... and Ann is right next to them. The fact that this mere earthling knows about her acquaintance/workmate/something doesn't really seem to bother her, or come up when she's trying to uncover Sailor Moon's secret identity.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SailorMoonAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SailorMoonAbridged">Sailor Moon Abridged</a> plays with this a bit:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ali:</strong> Queen Beryl was right about Earth. <br/><strong>En:</strong> Who the f*ck is Queen Beryl?
</div></li><li> And in a similar situation to Endymion/Darien mentioned above, DiC decided that the two aliens would be Ann and Alan in both their alien <em>and</em> civilian forms. Yet it took the Scouts an entire story arc to piece together they're the same people.
</li></ul></li><li> A particularly amusing plothole involves Kaolinite's alias, Kaori. In the DiC dub, when Serena/Usagi visits Dr. Tomoe, she is surprised to see Kaolinite (Kaori Night in the dub) there. In the original, Tomoe says that she is his assistant, Kaori, so Usagi is relieved. In the dub, however, the assistant is <em>also</em> named Kaori Night, prompting Serena to say "I thought she was the evil Kaori Night, but she must be someone else!". Epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Clark Kenting</a>.
</li><li> A smaller example is that in the <em>S</em> season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Amara and Michelle</a> are always calling Usagi "Serena-moon-face-girl", which is not only a stupid insult but it was long before they actually knew Serena was indeed, Sailor Moon.
</li><li> On a related note, the Cloverway dub tried <em>very</em> hard to rub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">that "cousins" thing</a> in the audience's face; they did that by having at least one line per episode announcing that (ex. "Oh, she's my cousin, Michelle"; "They're both girls, and cousins too!"). But at least once Kaolinite was the person spouting said line, which makes no sense as Kaolinite couldn't know Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus' identities and, therefore, couldn't know they were related.
<ul><li> A particularly noticeable example comes in the DiC dub of Episode 96 ("Lita Borrows Trouble"). Lita is riding in a car with Amara and Michelle and this comes up:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lita:</strong> How'd you guys meet then? <br/><strong>Michelle:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">We're cousins</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">We grew up together</a>. <em>[Lita lets out a shocked expression for no particular reason]</em> <br/><strong>Amara:</strong> We've been inseparable since we were born.
</div></li><li> ... Then comes Episode 106 (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">"Related by Destiny"</a>), where the two are revealed to be cousins who "grew apart." So much for "inseparable since we were born", huh?
</li></ul></li><li> In the episode where we find out Hotaru is Sailor Saturn, the DiC dub makes Uranus, Neptune and Pluto aware that Saturn will appear, when they originally weren't. This wasn't a major change by itself, but the dub also stated the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Sovereign of Silence</a> would appear when Saturn eclipses the other planets. Not only could Saturn not eclipse all the other planets, but it was Sailor Saturn that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">was revealed</a>, not the Messiah of Silence. The dub still tried to make it happen, though, which included giving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> additional "magnetic" powers to pull Saturn into position (which wouldn't work anyway, considering the distance from Saturn and the fact that it's a gas giant).
</li><li> The DiC dub's tendency to have Pegasus randomly call Rini by name (the original had him calling her "Maiden") backfired near the end of the season, ruining a scene where in the Japanese version Helios finally calls her "Chibiusa". The dub had to use "Minimoon" instead, which is <em>not</em> her name — yet her reaction is pretty much the same as in the original.
</li><li> Fisheye, a very feminine man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan">whose gender is usually changed</a> due to his obvious homosexuality and his habit of physically changing to a female form in his civilian disguises, has a shirtless scene in one episode that was intended to make sure viewers knew he really <em>was</em> a man. <em>Most</em> dubs that swapped his gender cut the scene for obvious reasons. Emphasis on <em>most.</em> The French dub kept this intact with no explanation. The Russian dub did as well, though a bystander calls "her" an uncouth woman. The English dub on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a>'s run tried to fix the camera angles to keep most of the scene anyway, but this made the scene even racier because they framed every shot as if Fisheye was a topless woman who was flashing everyone around her. The DVD release kept the video footage unaltered, and thus have a clearly male Fisheye being referred to as a girl.
</li><li> Given the overall quality of the Russian <em>SuperS</em> dub, a number of fans actually blame the entire case of Fisheye's gender change on the new translators simply not having done the research rather than censorship (nobody seemed to have problems with Zoisite or Haruka crossdressing before that point, with all the homosexual relationships barely toned down). Notably, it wasn't until a few episodes into the season when it became clear Fisheye was indeed male. Did we mention that the Starlights occasionally retained male voices even in the Sailor Guardian forms?
</li><li> In the German dub, Fish Eye has a female voice, even though it is even stated that he's male. But if you compare to the Japanese version, Fish Eye sounds very female there despite having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraIshida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraIshida">a male voice actor</a>.
</li><li> An oddly inverted example happened in the Russian-dubbed filler episode of <em>S</em> involving Tamasaburou. The character in question is known to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan">changed into a girl</a> in the DiC dub, presumably because he crossdressed at the end of the episode. In the Russian dub, Chibiusa identifies the character as a "young man" when she first sees him, but after a proper introduction the character is consistently referred to as female, with no explanation.
</li><li> A much worse case is the Russian dub of the <em>Stars</em> season, where Haruka basically was turned into another Starlight  they gave her a really bad man's voice in civilian form. This, despite the fact that the character was acknowledged as female in <em>S</em>, which was translated by another company. The fact that the change was done to cover up the infamous lesbian relationship (left unchanged by the previous translators) is pretty obvious from the dialogue.
</li><li> Because the Swedish network TV4 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">didn't want the audience to be</a> confused by Japanese songs, they asked the dubbing company to remove any song — and, when that was impossible, to skip the episode altogether. This led to several plotholes in the <em>R</em> season, the biggest being the Sailor Guardians suddenly knowing all about the Black Moon and Crystal Tokyo because we weren't shown Episode 68.
</li><li> An early episode in the show concerned Ami befriending the caretaker of a park that was about to be demolished for office space. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesop</a> turns dark when Nephrite plants a youma in the old man's hat and he causes the park's animals to destroy the construction equipment. Now, in the Japanese version, this causes the construction project to end due to the construction crews being afraid of returning to the park, resolving the subplot. In the DiC dub, the exact same scene where the old man is given this information is instead changed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> rejecting him once again and vowing to destroy the park. The dub never mentions the park subplot again, so it's up in the air whether the park is saved or not (especially since the CEO was still attacked by bloodthirsty squirrels in both versions).
</li><li> In the very first episode, Naru's ("Molly" in the English dub) mother is replaced by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</a> youma. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> and anime, the youma states that she left Naru's mom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> in the basement after stealing her form (the manga even shows her tied up with some tape over her mouth), and that she plans on killing her later. This is completely cut out of the DiC dub, with the only reference to her fate being a line from Tuxedo Mask about how Naru's mom had been freed along with the women whom had been drained of their energy by the Youma. This makes no sense, as Naru's mother wasn't shown among the youma's victims, and certainly wasn't in the store when they were being drained of their energy.
</li><li> The Hungarian dub, besides carrying the faults of the French translation it had been adapted from, had a very messy script in general because the translator, who has admitted to not being very good at French, only understood an odd word here and there. So you have things like characters shouting angrily when they're obviously happy, telling others to change into their Sailor gear when they already have, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">"Blind Idiot" Translation</a> in general.
</li><li> While Poland never dubbed the series and used a voiceover instead, there were still a few plot holes. The biggest ones were caused by leaving Episodes 45, 46 and 133 unaired. The first two were most likely banned due to the violence and deaths (though Polsat claims they never received the episodes in the first place), which resulted in fans never getting to see the defeat of Dark Kingdom and the Sailor Guardians and Mamoru suddenly losing their memory. Not to mention that some scenes from those two episodes appeared in the following episode. As for the latter, it was banned to avoid offending Catholics, however that episode marked Diana's debut, making her popping out of nowhere in the Polish version.

<ul><li> By far the most infamous edit-by-omission 4Kids made was their decision to cut out the first leg of the Grand Line  Laboon and Little Garden  in order to more quickly reach the point where a cute, highly-marketable new crew member (i.e. Chopper) is introduced. This had several ramifications.
<ul><li> 4Kids's decision came back to haunt them <em>even before the Alabasta Arc ended</em>. They had to completely rewrite the "Rain Dinners" scene<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2tjj7');"><sup> </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2tjj7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2tjj7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (partway through the Alabasta Arc, which is the final part of the Baroque Works Over-Arc)</span> after Mr. 3 comes in, because removing Little Garden meant Mr.3 was never introduced, let alone defeated, and thus Sanji never impersonated him while taking a call from Crocodile, thus Crocodile never had any reason to feed Mr. 3 to the banana-gator (except just to show he's a bad guy).
</li><li> Luffy refusing to take Miss All-Sunday's Eternal pose to Alabasta became a non-issue, because Vivi somehow happens to have one (in the <em>not</em>-4Kids versions, Sanji stole the eternal pose from Mr. 3 on Little Garden).
</li><li> Minor example compared to the whoppers above: Nami contracted her near-fatal disease  the treatment of which ultimately resulted in Chopper joining the Straw Hats  on Little Garden.
</li></ul></li><li> 4Kids's editing during the Arlong Arc also created some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm">facepalm-worthy</a> plot holes.
<ul><li> Belle Mere's death was cut and instead it's said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">she was imprisoned by Arlong</a>. This raises two questions, 1. Where the hell did Arlong imprison her when Arlong Park hasn't been built yet and, much more glaringly, 2. Where the hell did Belle Mere go and why does no one mention freeing her after Arlong is beaten?
</li><li> Partway through the arc, when Usopp is taken to Arlong Park and sees Nami. In the uncut version of that sequence, Arlong gives Nami a knife to prove her loyalty by stabbing Usopp. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">She decides to fake it</a>, putting her hand in front of Usopp and stabbing <em>through</em> it, allowing a shocked Usopp to fall into the pool behind him, drenched in her blood. In the 4Kids version, through very cheap copy-pasting of scenes, Nami elaborates an impossibly convenient plan to Usopp <em>while preparing to "stab" him</em>  Usopp had to replace Nami's knife with a rubber knife (that he conveniently had with him, and that conveniently looked exactly the same as Arlong's knife), Nami hits him with it, and the rest of the scene is played largely the same.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3a1um');"><sup> </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3a1um" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3a1um');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Well, aside from the fact that in the 4Kids version, Nami continues to coach Usopp by gently guiding him into the pool behind him; whereas in the uncut version, though she's acting, Nami harshly tells Usopp (who is in shock from watching Nami stab herself to save him) to go and die.</span> But in the next episode, Nami's hand is just suddenly injured for absolutely no reason.
</li><li> They cut out that arc's denouement almost in its entirety, skipping straight from Luffy beating Arlong to the crew leaving Cocoyashi village, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">leaving no explanation as to why Johnny and Yosaku were suddenly gone</a> or why Nami suddenly had a different tattoo. In the uncut version, Johnny and Yosaku explained that they had to go back to their jobs as bounty hunters, and Nami  who tried to remove the Arlong tattoo on her shoulder by stabbing it repeatedly with her knife  asked to have the remains of it drawn over to make a pinwheel and tangerine.
</li></ul></li><li> A minor one occurs in the Buggy Arc of the 4kids dub. Zoro calls Nami by name at a point when he would have no reason to know it, as neither she nor Luffy had told him yet.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">Plot holes that would have happened if the 4Kids dub lasted longer</a>:
<ul><li> The Straw Hats' knowing the giant whale Laboon turns out to be the primary reason Brook decides to join them; the 4kids dub ended before he had the chance to appear.
</li><li> Meeting the Elbaf Giants, Dorry and Broggy, on Little Garden provided the motivation for Usopp to finally start improving himself. It's also how he convinced the Gatekeeper Giants of Enies Lobby (Season 5) to turn on the World Government and briefly team up with the Straw Hats<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14zis');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14zis" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14zis');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The giants were former members of the Elbaf Pirate crew. When they were caught by the Marines, the Marines lied that Dorry and Broggy had been caught too, but if the Giants served as Gatekeepers for 100 years, the Marines would let them all go. Naturally, learning via Usopp that Dorry and Broggy were just fine and they'd wasted over half a century of their lives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">made them instant and very angry allies</a>.</span>, that later scene didn't show up in the 4kids dub.
</li></ul></li><li> Even the normally-stellar FUNimation uncut redub falls prey to this a couple of times.
<ul><li> First and foremost, when FUNimation got the <em>One Piece</em> license, Toei's broadcast contract with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> was still in effect, meaning they had to start dubbing right where 4Kids stopped  the beginning of Season 3. The reason this was a problem is because Cartoon Network forced FUNimation to keep to 4Kids's established continuity to avoid confusion. CN either didn't know or didn't care how problematic this could have become later on, although it didn't matter because CN cancelled the show due to ratings not improving quickly enough. FUNimation, to their credit, responded to this by making two complete dubs for Season 3: a TV dub that kept continuity with the 4Kids version, and the uncut dub that appeared on the DVD sets.
</li><li> In Episode 68, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Monkey D.</span> Garp is referred to as an Admiral rather than his correct rank of Vice-Admiral. This becomes a major inconsistency when you learn later that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garp has turned down getting promoted to Admiral several times in the past</span>. However, in every subsequent appearance, FUNimation's dub <em>does</em> refer to Garp by his proper rank.
</li><li> In Chapter 217 of the manga, Smoker states that Zoro <em>defeated</em> Daz Bones, Baroque Works's "Mr.1"  he specifically says "defeated", which left Mr. 1's fate ambiguous for a time. Later on, the cover page of Chapter 361 revealed that he was still alive <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and would later appear during the last few Arcs before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a></span>. However, FUNimation's dub of Episode 130 has Smoker say that Mr.1 was outright <em>killed</em> by Zoro, however, most of the stories from cover pages weren't adapted in the anime, this one is an example.
</li></ul></li><li> An unavoidable one given that the contradiction only happened <em>decades</em> afterwards, but the official translation of the manga consistently choose to translate the name of Zoro's hometown of Shimotsuki Village literally as "Frost Moon Village". This causes problems as it's revealed in Wano that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the town was founded by members of the Shimotsuki Clan, with Zoro's master in fact being a direct descendent of one the town's founder.</span> The removal of the name connection causes the entire plotline to make far less sense.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kaiba's difficulty in translating The Winged Dragon of Ra's effects certainly qualifies. In the original manga and anime, every character who summons the Winged Dragon has to recite a hieratic text in the process, so Kaiba runs a rapid computer translation effort, in an attempt to figure out what the card does and how to properly use it. In the dub, however, characters summoning the monster simply have to recite a rhyming poem, and Kaiba <em>still</em> has to run his desperate translation. There was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it handwave that there was more than just the chant printed on the card, and that extra stuff was what Kaiba was trying to translate.
</li><li> There's the matter of the name of Yugi's alter-ego. In the original, he was called "Yami no Yugi" (among other nicknames), meaning "Dark Yugi". Most dub media referred to him as the shortened version "Yami Yugi", and at the end of the first season, he mentions that his name is Yami. In the second season of the dub, he states he's not sure about his real name—then Ishizu outright calls him "King Yami", and he responds, effectively, with "huh, okay then, good to know." Then in later seasons, it becomes a major plot point that he doesn't know his real name, and the story has them searching for his true name, "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Atem</span>". They attempted an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> and failed miserably by removing all mention of "Yami" as his name in the third season and having them go back to saying they don't know who he really is. In season three he's mostly just called "pharaoh" or "Yugi" for the sake of convenience.
</li><li> When Yami Yugi first says his name to be "Yami", he also says "I've been called many names. <em>Pharaoh</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam">Yu-Gi-Oh</a>, Yami..." Notice "Pharaoh" as one of the names he gave. Then in the next season, he is shocked to learn that he's the spirit of an ancient pharaoh!
</li><li> In the original version, Insector Haga/Weevil Underwood was pretty polite and friendly when talking to Yugi, openly giving advice and compliments. This meant it made sense when Yugi let him see Exodia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">he responded by chucking the cards into the ocean.</a> In the dub, his dialogue was made far more obviously rude and condescending, making Yugi look like an idiot for handing off rare cards to a future rival who is also a huge jerk.
</li><li> The dub changed the Duelist Kingdom prize from three million yen (about 30,000 dollars) to three million dollars. In both versions, Jounouchi/Joey is in the tournament to win off enough money to pay his sister's medical bill, and it's shown that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">he isn't much more well-off after doing so</a>, implying that paying for it blew through most or all of the money. While there are a lot of medical procedures that could crack the low five digits in cost, there aren't nearly as many that crack <em>seven</em>, raising the question of how his sister's eye operation could possibly cost more than twice as much as a heart transplant.
</li><li> While it's not as bad as with Blair below, Rebecca's character makes a bit more sense when you realize she's supposed to be twelve-going-on-thirteen and not eight-going-on-nine.
</li><li> Although ridiculous, 4Kids' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">death cover ups</a> were usually convincing (at least enough so that someone who didn't know about the original version could be fooled). There were exceptions though; the most egregious was Alister's (Amelda) little brother's fate. In the original version, he was killed in a war, and so Amelda blamed the Kaiba Corp, who created the tank who killed him, so he's out for revenge. In the dub, his brother was merely "captured" by the KC. Now, that generates a number of questions that are never answered: 1) What would a weapons developing company want with a random boy (and yes, the possible answers to that question are more creepy than the concept of death)?; 2) When Kaiba took over the company and converted it to a game developing one, wouldn't he... y'know... free the kid? 3) Why doesn't Kaiba free the kid <em>now</em>, or at least look the kid up, if Alister seems to talk about his brother as if he's still captured? 4) If he's merely "captured", why does his <em>ghost</em> show up in the season finale?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fvp1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2fvp1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fvp1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You could say that his brother had his soul taken by the Orichalcos, like the rest, but then that doesn't explain why his spirit literally enters Alister's body soon after.</span> 5) Why does Alister treat his brother as if he's gone forever when he also acts as if he's still alive, and Alister's organization should be able to track him down fairly easily? Nothing is really explained, and almost any viewer paying the slightest attention could see through.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, Raphael's backstory in both versions is that he was in a shipwreck, lived alone on an island for years with nothing but his cards, and eventually returned to society to become a loner and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerInAFamiliarLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerInAFamiliarLand">Stranger in a Familiar Land</a>. In the original, the rest of his family perished in said wreck. In the dub, they survived, but never tried to get back in contact with him. While this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">actually made more sense to some people</a> (being rejected outright by your family for no good reason would probably be a better motivator for Raphael's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a> outlook than them simply dying in an accident), they didn't remove the many scenes where Raphael has a flashback to him being separated from his siblings in the wreck and seems clearly torn-up about it. Makes sense when they died right after that event, less so when they're still alive, he could meet with them whenever he wanted to, and he hates their guts. For that matter, one wonders why he never flashes back to being rejected by his family, when that would surely be more traumatic (the answer being, because that scene doesn't actually exist).
</li><li> Kaiba and Yugi's tag-team duel with Masks of Light and Darkness takes place on top of a giant glass building, with explosives at the side to break the glass the players are standing on as soon as their life points reach 0. In the dub, however, this is altered to have a portal to the Shadow Realm just below the glass roof. Apart from being a very thin case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization">Bowdlerization</a> as it is, it looks even more ridiculous when Umbra/Mask of Darkness falls through and, rather than suddenly becoming a soulless zombie, is able to activate a parachute which floats him to safety.
</li><li> In the dub, Marik needs the Millennium Puzzle along with the Egyptian God Cards to obtain the power of the Pharaoh. The problem is that his puppets get their hands on it at several occassions, and the dub tries to hand wave this by claiming that Marik "has to win it properly in a duel", otherwise, he won't get the Pharaoh's power. In the original, Malik doesn't need the Millennium Puzzle at all and only wants the Pharaoh dead (or rather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">deader than he already is</a>).
</li><li> Odion/Rishid's internal monologue in the dub has him thinking at one point that he has to do something blatantly suicidal because "Master Marik always knows best." This proved rather problematic when later appearances by the guy had him saying that he thinks everything Marik is doing is horrible and wrong, he's known this for years, and he's only sticking with Marik because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">he thinks letting Marik go unsupervised would be even worse</a>.
</li><li> When the anime premiered in Poland, Episode 49 <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3mkvg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3mkvg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3mkvg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(the last one of the first season, which was the only one dubbed in Poland)</span> was unaired for unknown reasons, meaning that Polish viewers never got to see how Yugi's duel with Duke ended.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> has developed to tendency to make dialogue changes while leaving any corresponding original visuals completely unaltered, so this is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>:
<ul><li> The constant rain motif in Ed's flashbacks in the second season is always seen at his father's grave, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">thus was edited out</a>. Thus the re-use of the motif in Ed's mental conversation with Saiou while he's dueling him seems a little random.
</li><li> When the cast is sent to the world of Duel Monsters in Season 3, they find out that anyone who loses a duel there dies. However, 4Kids replaced death with a vague description about how the loser was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">"sent to the stars"</a>. This makes the reveal at the end of the season <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(everyone was trapped in a pocket dimension)</span> basically pointless.
</li><li> Blair's age was lowered from twelve to eight, an age she definitely didn't look — especially when she hit a growth spurt between appearances. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> was attempted by not bringing up her age in the vain hope that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish">nobody would remember what they said her age was if they didn't state it</a>.
</li><li> In the Japanese, the Blue-Eyes White Dragon's attack has always been called "Burst Stream of Destruction." In English, it was instead given the name "White Lightning." Not a big problem, until Judai faces Kaibaman, and he uses the card called Burst Stream of Destruction. In both languages, a mention of the card having the same name as the Blue-Eyes' attack is made as Kaibaman uses the card, which seems completely out of the blue in the English translation, since the Blue-Eyes' attack is still being called "White Lightning."
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> character was, in the original, a cosplayer obsessed with kabuki theater. In a clumsy attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyism</a>, the dub changed this to him being an actor on Broadway. The thing is, kabuki theatre and Broadway theatre aren't really known for being similar, so you have a man in a kimono and red-and-white facepaint, whose name is Orlando and whose dialogue constantly references Broadway productions like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WestSideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WestSideStory">West Side Story</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/FiddlerOnTheRoof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/FiddlerOnTheRoof">Fiddler on the Roof</a></em>, but who never talks about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MusashiboBenkei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MusashiboBenkei">Kanjinchō</a></em>, the play his entire deck is based around.
</li><li> In Judai/Jaden's duel with Cobra/Viper, his dialogue at one point does not match the actual cards he's fusing and summoning.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Not dubbing the fourth season</a> seemed like an acceptable idea at the time... until the tenth anniversary movie came along, and Judai was in it. They also didn't dub the episode where Judai returns - in their version, he doesn't come back from the Dark World. They never address why Jaden is back, why his character design has changed, why he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> with Yubel, Pharaoh, and Banner, why he has darkness powers, or why he seems to know Yugi.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>:
<ul><li> The dub treats Jack's current motorbike and the one he stole from Yusei as one and the same—but they eventually showed a flashback to the theft, completely ignoring the fact that the two bikes look nothing alike.
</li><li> The dub has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rex Goodwin</span> claim to be the fifth Signer, even before his identity had been revealed in the original. It later turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rex's brother Rudger</span> was originally the 5th Signer, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rex doesn't become one until the end of the arc after he replaces his arm with Rudger's.</span> In an attempt to fix this, as soon as the Dark Signer arc started, the dub had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goodwin</span> backpedal and say "I don't <em>know</em> who the fifth Signer is, but..."
</li><li> The dub identifies Yusei's Signer mark as the dragon's head (thus ruining the dramatic switch at the end of the season), and turns Jack's wings into the left wing (where was the right gonna come from?)
</li><li> The second episode dub has Yusei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> constantly remarking about how some crippling fear of bugs must be making him too scared to fight against his opponent's Insect Deck... all while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> hero is facing said insect monsters as calm, silent and fearless as ever. Yeah...
</li><li> An episode flashing back to Aki/Akiza's past showed her wearing a red school uniform, and attacking a boy with a blue uniform. The dub used this to claim that Neo Domino's Duel Academy uses the same Obelisk Blue/Slifer Red/Ra Yellow hierarchy as the one in <em>GX</em>, with blues at the top, yellows in the middle, and reds at the bottom. But actually check the flashback more closely, and you realize that all the people wearing red uniforms are girls, all the people wearing blue are boys, and there aren't any people in yellow—because that ranking system is exclusive to the <em>GX</em> Academy. There's a red uniform and a blue uniform, sure, but they're just the girl's uniform and the boy's uniform, respectively, and aren't intended to indicate skill level. Then that Duel Academy was reintroduced later, and you had Aki in a red uniform being called the top scorer and teacher favorite, and Rua in a blue uniform being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> slacker on the verge of expulsion, and still no yellows anywhere. Needless to say, the idea was quietly dropped.
</li><li> The dub of Episode 26 manages to make a rather MAJOR one right at the start. The beginning of the episode is replaced by their "Now let's get up to speed with Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's!" recap. Said beginning of the episode in Japanese shows Red Demon's Dragon destroying Junk Warrior, Yusei's Life Points dropping to 1900 from the attack, and Jack placing 3 cards face down. The English episode starts from after the title card in the Japanese version, making confused viewers wonder where Yusei's monster went to, why he's down a few hundred LP and where Jack's face downs came from.
</li><li> 4Kids seemed to have skipped a few episodes after the Yusei vs. Primo/Placido to get right into the 5Ds vs. Ragnarok team duel. Not too big of problem, except that means Jack's Red Nova Dragon has NO explanation behind it and seemingly comes out of nowhere. Not to mention Jack sounds weird with his summoning speech about having a Burning Soul. Whoops. These episodes are available subbed on Hulu, however.
</li><li> 4Kids skipped all of Season 5 (the Ark Cradle) in favor of starting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">ZEXAL</a>, which means that viewers of the dub won't learn of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bruno's identity, history and everything that happens in the real final battle</span>. Z-One's plot is also left hanging.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://mmpu.smuncensored.com/ep13.html">Masaya chases Ichigo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who is running away in fear that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> has been exposed. He finally stops her by calling her by her first name instead of her last. In the dub, however, he'd <em>always</em> called her by her first name, so she just stops for no apparent reason.
<ul><li> And Bu-ling<em>/</em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tokyopop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tokyopop">Pudding</a><em>/</em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">Kikki</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://mmpu.smuncensored.com/ep7.html">lives in a shelter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> now because she can't live alone... until they show <a class="urllink" href="http://mmpu.smuncensored.com/ep20.html">an episode with her house.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Even though it is explained in the dub by Minto<em>/</em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tokyopop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tokyopop">Mint</a><em>/</em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">Corina</a> that they had made a mistake in thinking that she lives in a shelter, it was still blatantly obvious that the writers only saw a few episodes at a time and didn't sit down and watch the entire show.
</li><li> In the episode Zakuro joins the team, Quiche demanded that she and Ichigo fought, and the winner would be allowed to join him and maybe save the other Mew Mews. In the dub, Dren only says that if they fought the other girls would be saved, omitting the "joining him" thing. Which wouldn't be a problem, except later in the episode he references that proposal anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> The English translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">The End of Evangelion</a></em> has Misato explain her findings on the Second Impact to Shinji when she transports him to Unit-01, saying how humans were spawned from the progenitor entity Lilith. However, the translation has her incorrectly state that Adam was <em>also</em> born from Lilith, where Adam and Lilith were actually unrelated, having been two separate progenitor entities that happened to land on the same planet. It's still no easier to grasp the concept, though, and this mistranslation is present in both the subbed and dubbed versions of the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the dub, when Eggman's base explodes as a result of Chaos Control, Amy asks, "What is that?" leading Knuckles to reply, "It used to be Chaos Control." In the original Japanese, he just says "Chaos Control...". The original is referring to Chaos Control as the power of the emeralds, but the dub seems to use it as the name of Eggman's base.
</li><li> This mistake pops up again. When Eggman tries to convince Knuckles that Sonic is evil, during a flashback, he talks about how Sonic attacked, invaded, and destroyed Chaos Control, as his base goes by on screen. The first can be excused by having it be the effects of a warped/subverted form of Chaos Control, this example makes much less sense.
</li><li> This also pops up during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> adaption arc. In the original version (and the game the story arc is based on), the ARK incident involved lots of scientists being killed and imprisoned (to be executed later) when G.U.N. stormed the arc and shut down research. The dub ended up switching the story to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">"the project was shut down and everyone went home".</a> This immediately starts screwing with the plot, as they had a difficult time hunting down ONE scientist from the project, and he was scared to death of discussing it. This also screws with Shadow and Maria's story, as she's "taken away" rather than killed, making Shadow's motivations and actions in response a lot more nonsensical, and prompting the viewer to wonder why the G.U.N. soldier recounting the experience seems to be so horrified by the memory (in the original version, he was the one who shot Maria). It's especially strange since the game itself <em>was rated E for Everyone</em>, and thus it's likely that kids watching the show would have played the original game and learned the actual story anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> In the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue">Perfect Blue</a></em>, the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mima's expression of "I'm the real one!" said in Rumi's voice, giving the viewer one final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> as to whether it truly is Mima or not. This is lost in the dub where not only is the line changed to the less intimidating "I'm the real thing!", but it is also said in Mima's voice.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie">Digimon: The Movie</a></em> is rife with these, as it compressed <em>three</em> Japanese <em>Digimon</em> films haphazardly into one for American audiences. The most obvious problem: the first two films are canon, and fit into the timeline very easily, having been referenced often in the show. The third one is a fairly clear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a>—among other things, a major plot point in the film is that Patamon and Gatomon have Mega forms, when they couldn't go past Ultimate for the entire run of <em>02</em>. The movie has the unfortunate honor of kludging the three together, resulting in some major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> questions which weren't there before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> The handling of the living situation of Matt and TK (divorced parents, Matt lives with their father, TK with their mother) is handled very inconsistently. The first dub mention of this claimed that Matt and TK were "half-brothers". It later changed to them being full brothers whose parents were divorced (correct), but went on to add that Matt lived with their mother and thus TK would live with their father. Come their return to the real world, the inverse was proven to be true.
</li><li> In an early episode of the dub, Mimi says that she's starting to miss her little brother. Later on when they get home, she is shown to be an only child.
</li><li> In the original version, Wizardmon and Tailmon sneak into Vamdemon's hideout to recover the Crest of Light from his coffin, with Wizardmon stashing it in his clothes when Vamdemon returns, realizes what they're doing, and crushes the fake Crest that he was holding in anger. In the dub, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Myotismon</a> claims that the Crest in the coffin is another fake, and that he kept the real one on him. This might make Myotismon seem more cunning, but he still crushes the Crest he's holding, and it's never seen how Wizardmon got a hold of the real one.
</li><li> Another one involving Myotismon is that the dub removed the reason he was attacking women at night and leaving them with a case of anemia was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining">he was gathering enough energy</a> to fight the DigiDestined, making it look like he was attacking girls for no reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">except for the fun of it</a>. Which wouldn't necessarily be out-of-character for him, mind...
</li><li> The dub also paved the way to break some future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>, though they couldn't necessarily have seen it coming at the time. Omegamon, the Jogressed form of Taichi and Yamato's partners WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon, was dubbed as "Omnimon" in the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> film when he appeared. A couple of years later, Alphamon was introduced (as in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">the alpha and the omega</a>"), and both he and Omegamon were added to the Royal Knights group. They appeared together in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorldDawnDusk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorldDawnDusk">Digimon World Dawn/Dusk</a></em>, where in reference to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a> they were always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingEachOthersSentences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingEachOthersSentences">Finishing Each Other's Sentences</a>. Obviously it makes sense with "Alphamon" and "Omegamon", but with "Alphamon" and "Omnimon"... not so much. Later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em>, Omegamon is partially responsible for enabling Shoutmon to be able to evolve to OmegaShoutmon, who has a clear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">omega theme</a> going on. The American dub, <em>Digimon Fusion</em>, changes Omegamon to Omnimon as usual, and ends up calling Shoutmon's new form OmniShoutmon, which unfortunately renders the omega symbols meaningless.
</li><li> <em>Adventure</em> has a doozy in Episode 28, where Koushiro/Izzy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">trying to open a gateway to another world by finding the right order to place Digimon cards in</a>. Not only does he classify the evolutionary levels wrong (calling them In-Training, Rookie and Champion instead of Rookie, Champion and Ultimate), he completely mixes up the classification (Data, Virus and Vaccine, as represented by respective pictures of Centarumon, Etemon and Leomon  he calls Centarumon a Virus, Etemon a Vaccine and Leomon a Data).
</li><li> An irritating one in a later episode: after Gato/Tailmon de-digivolves for the first time into Salamon, Kari laments that they don't allow pets in their apartment building. Despite the fact that Tai and Kari already own a cat. A cat that has been seen several times in the dub already. And even got one or two scenes to itself for comic relief.
</li><li> One instance of this trope also happened due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerisation">Bowdlerisation</a>. Towards the end of the Myotismon arc, Sora uses a <em>recording</em> of the mantra "Bakemon, lose your power" to weaken a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetGhost">Bakemon</a> enough that a planned escape attempt by her and a few other people succeeds. This scene is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to an earlier scene where Joe used the same mantra to weaken a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook">King Mook</a> version of Bakemon enough to be able to be defeated. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">Dub-Induced Plot Hole</a> comes into play since Joe chanted Buddhist sutras in the original, which might be able to also work via recording if the words themselves hold power even without the speaker's faith behind them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>:
<ul><li> The dub accidentally turned Jou's two brothers, Shin and Shuu, into Joe's one brother, Jim. After the writing staff were replaced, both brothers appeared in the same scene and no reference was made.
</li><li> The dub's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On</a> segments referred to Arukenimon (originally Archnemon) by name several episodes before her name was used in the actual episodes, also revealing that she was in fact a Digimon and not a human. The heroes also use her name for a bit before they even met her in person when she <em>told</em> them her name.
</li><li> Digitamamon's restaurant. The original dub makes it very clear that the main DigiDestined are Japanese, and so are unable to pay because Digitmamon wants US dollars and won't accept Japanese yen in payment. However, Michael, a recurring American character, <em>does</em> have dollars and is able to pay. The English dub leaves nationality much more vague and ambiguous, and so has Digitamamon demand 'digidollars' to explain why the kids can't pay - but Michael is <em>still</em> able to pay, without any explanation of how he acquired these digidollars.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Leomon dies, he tells Juri that maybe his death was his "destiny". This leads Juri to become traumatized (and somewhat obsessed, after the D-Reaper thing) by the word "destiny". In the dub, Leomon's last line is telling Jeri that she has a lion's heart. Since most of the later episodes were written by different people, Jeri still mentions multiple times "when Leomon told me about how that was his destiny", even though it also repeatedly flashes back to the scene and replays the "lion's heart" quote unmodified. Unless you assume that took place offscreen (which is a pretty cheap way to introduce a plot point), the whole thing was kinda messy.
</li><li> The German dub gave Renamon a male voice. Initially, it's not much of a problem, since Digimon have technically no gender. Ruki's comment about Renamon being beautiful can be interpreted as innocent, but it makes it a bit flamboyant. However, since Renamon's Ultimate/Mega Level looks definitely female, Sakuyamon gets a separate voice actress. And later in a dinner scene, when Ruki's mother asks Renamon about the genders of Digimon, Renamon answers that only a few exceptions have something like a gender, and Ruki's mother comments that Renamon appears to be female, despite its obvious male voice.
</li></ul></li><li> For some reason, the German dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em> made all Holy Four Angel Digimon female and gave all of them female voice actors. But Patamon, the weaker and reborn version of Seraphimon, had the same male voice as the Patamon from <em>Adventures</em>.
</li><li> The German dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em> gave some of the Digimon their Japanese names, despite some of them had the Western names from previous series. Most notably are the members of the Royal Knights.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The most infamous example involves <a class="urllink" href="http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/comparisons/kanto/ep005.html">Brock(/Takeshi)'s mother running away,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which was actually edited <em>up</em> to her death (as 4Kids felt that Brock having both of his parents abandon him was too sad). Since <a class="urllink" href="http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/comparisons/chronicles/ep005.html">the episode she appears in<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> happens <em>much</em> later in the show (and because 4Kids thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">the concept of death was worse</a> than being away for a while), it was pretty much ignored. Some English-speaking viewers also assumed she was meant to be Brock's stepmother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut">given that she's the only one in the family to have eyes</a>.
</li><li> Let's not forget <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP035">Ash's 30 Tauros that apparently came out of nowhere!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This is due to the episode where Ash <em>got</em> the Tauros being skipped for having a large presence of realistic firearms being pointed and occasionally fired at both the protagonists and Team Rocket.
</li><li> The Latin American dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000">Pokémon 2000</a></em> runs into this problem partly due to basing itself off of 4kids' English version. In the English dub, a prophecy ends with the phrase "and the world will turn to... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleMeaning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleMeaning">ash</a>." The problem is, some Latin American viewers might not know enough English to know that Ash Ketchum's first name means "ceniza", requiring the Latin American voices to explain this to the audience. The Finnish dub, also dubbed from the 4Kids version, does the same thing, but the bigger problem was that the prophecy's ambiguity could not be preserved in the Finnish language; the world will either <em>become ash</em>, or <em>look to Ash for help</em>, and there's no way to construct a sentence that can be read both ways. The dubbers went with "become ash", and just acted as though the second meaning was still there.
</li><li> The Italian dub refers to any Pokémon with male pronouns. Then some Pokémon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion">are stated</a> to be female. The result is that Ash's Snivy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">becomes a female</a> when using Attract, and is referred as a male every other time. Same for Iris's Emolga.
</li><li> Ever wondered why Jessie's Wobbuffet kept popping up and saying its name? Well, Wobbuffet is originally based on a Japanese comedian, whose catchphrase was "so nansu," meaning roughly "that's how it is." This was reflected in its original name, "Sonans." So every time someone said something, it would pop up and say "That's how it is!" Since they didn't try to translate the pun, Wobbuffet's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst">main joke</a> became a complete non sequitur. Learning their lesson, they did translate its pre-evolution's name correctly (Sonano, whose name means "Is that so?" became Wynaut). This led to an odd scene where the two talk to each other ("Is that so?" "That's how it is!" "Is that so?") and half the pun is preserved, but the other half isn't.
</li><li> The episode where Ash catches Squirtle contains an obvious one. It's stated that the Squirtle Gang named themselves... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">Except they can only say "Squirtle."</a> In the Japanese version the humans named their gang.
</li><li> When Ash returned to Viridian City for his eighth Kanto Badge, it's stated in the English dub that it had been a year since he was there last. In the short accompanying <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon3">Spell of the Unown</a></em>, Ash celebrates the first anniversary of him and Pikachu meeting.
</li><li> On a lesser note, a number of overtly Japanese culture-focused episodes were removed from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea">South Korean</a> dub, several of which included Ash obtaining League Badges and the earliest of which featured his Metapod evolving into Butterfree, leaving these unexplained to viewers. It's worth noting that this occurred before the government eased its restrictions on Japanese imports, though.
</li><li> In "Alola, Kanto!" Misty describes herself as an "internationally known beauty." In the Japanese version of the anime, one of Misty's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrases</a> was to talk about how she was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman">World's Most Beautiful Woman</a>. The 4Kids dub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubPersonalityChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubPersonalityChange">toned down</a> her haughtiness. TPCi's more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText">Truer to the Text</a> dub, however, decided to stay true to the Japanese script instead of the 4Kids script. Thus the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> is lost by most English speaking fans. This continues into the following episode, "When Regions Collide!", which has her refer to her Pokémon as her "beauties" and "steadies" in battle, likely confusing some viewers who are unfamiliar with the Japanese version as Misty never addressed her Pokémon as such in the 4Kids dub.
</li><li> The English dub does not include the omake portions where Professor Oak recites poetry. This thus makes Oak's poetic nature in the anime itself come out of nowhere.
</li><li> Why are the Pokémon League championships called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">Pokémon League Conferences</a>? It's thanks to a mistranslation. In Japan, they're called Pokémon League Tournaments. However, the last word can also be translated as "conference", depending on the context. Given that the event is question is a tournament in which league participants battle each other, it's clear that that's not the intended meaning here. Unfortunately, the dubbers couldn't be bothered to apply some context, so they translated it as Pokémon League Conference, and never bothered correcting it in later seasons.
</li><li> As early as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Hoenn</a>, Japanese interviews have made it clear that Ash is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">eternally 10 years old</a>. The English dub ignored this for years. Characters refer to years going by but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">no time passes</a>. Ash's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">second voice actress</a> also has a noticeably deeper voice than his first, giving off the image that Ash hit puberty. Eventually, however, the dub had to mention Ash's age in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Black and White</a></em>. Since then, the dub has stopped referring to the timespan of Ash's journey.
</li><li> A minor one compared to the rest of the page, but worth noting anyway, as it's often overlooked: In "Holiday Hi-Jinx", Ash and co. are taken to the North Pole on the back of a Lapras, and appear to make it there and back in about a day. Yet the next season, they are traveling through the Orange Archipelago on a Lapras, and take the entire season to do so. The sun is shown to rise and set numerous times across the season, so clearly it's not happening in just one day, and the islands are clearly much closer to one another than the North Pole is from Kanto. So why is there a discrepancy? In the original Japanese of "Holiday Hi-Jinx", they <em>don't</em> go to the North Pole, but to "Santa's island" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note43c8f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note43c8f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note43c8f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is not some Japanese tradition; the writers made it up because apparently even the group responsible for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">famously strange</a> first season recognized that reaching the North Pole from the Kanto region on a seagoing creature in just a day was unbelievable</span> instead, which is at an undisclosed distance. It could be as near the Kanto region as necessary for the plot.
</li><li> Much like in the games, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Sun and Moon</a></em> series renames the Island Kings and Queens to the more ambiguous Island Kahunas; which wasn't a problem until the series reached the Poni Island arc, which has a major plot point surrounding Hapu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">trying to be recognized by Tapu-Fini after taking the reins from her grandfather Sofu, who died before the events of the story</span>. A downplayed example, as the plot thread is resolved differently than in the games.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation">Pocket Monsters: The Animation</a></em>, "Junsar" and "Joy" are surnames. This means that all of Officer Jennys and Nurse Joys share a family name, which makes more sense than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals">all of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyFamilyResemblance">them</a> sharing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">the same first name</a>. The English-speaking fandom seems to have largely caught on by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Diamond and Pearl</a></em> era. "Drifloon On the Wind!" (DP028) features a Nurse Joy with two daughters (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualsBreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualsBreed">who resemble her as opposed to their father</a>); they not only have different first names (firmly establishing Joy as a family name) but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">Overly Long Names</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/135351/why-do-all-the-joys-and-jennys-look-the-same">at that.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Then, "Luxray Vision!" (DP059) introduces a young Officer Jenny named Marble. Unlike the young Joys, it's not explicitly said that her full name is "Marble Jenny" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyRelated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyRelated">nor is her exact relation to that episode's Officer Jenny clarified</a> beyond Marble being "Jenny Trainee #1"), but most fans assume it is.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>. In the Filipino dub, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> Kurama was changed into a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan">girl</a></em> and called Denise. He was given a female voice actor and everything. This actually worked, up until an episode where Kurama has to take off his shirt. The dubbers handwaved this, saying that Kurama was really a <em>male</em> demon who was only <em>pretending</em> to be female on earth. Oops.
<ul><li> Also, Genkai was a man in the dub.
</li><li> The English dub has a few smaller ones:
<ul><li> The name "Spirit Wave" is given to two different techniques—the chant used by the Masked Fighter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to purify Dr. Ichigaki's brainwashed fighters</span>, and the <em>Reikodan,</em> used by Yusuke against Jin.
</li><li> During Kurama's fight against Ura Urashima, the character's false story is changed from him wanting to repent from a team formed by negative feelings involving the fairy tales they're based off of, to the team forcing him to fight by holding his grandmother hostage. But when he's spilling information to Yoko Kurama, he says "I'm not even Ura Urashima!" It's supposed to be him admitting his entire explanation was false and they were just hired goons, but with the changed story, the line makes no sense.
</li><li> When Yusuke starts his fight against Sensui, he admits that he doesn't really care about the portal to Demon Realm opening or not—all he wants is to fight Yusuke. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is Foreshadowing of his true desire.</span> The dub changes this conversation to emphasize his comments about how Yusuke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">could become just like him</a>. Later, however, Yusuke references the original line, echoing that all he cares about is fighting Sensui.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Naruto defeats Neji in the English dub, he tells Neji that he could never get the shadow clone jutsu right in order to graduate from the academy. This is a mistake; academy students had to perform the clone jutsu to pass, not the shadow clone jutsu. Besides, the shadow clone jutsu is a jonin-level technique, and when he learned it, Naruto complained about it being a harder version of the jutsu he couldn't master.
</li><li> A minor one occurs early in the series. The main village Konohagakure (or "Konoha" for short) had its name changed to "The Village Hidden in the Leaves" (or "Hidden Leaf Village", or just "Hidden Leaf" for short), which is a more-or-less direct translation of the name. It works for the most part, except for one thing: The character Konohamaru, grandson of Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, was explicitly named after the village in honor of it. When explaining this to Naruto in the second episode, it remains unchanged in the dub. This makes it a little confusing for viewers unfamiliar with the original.
</li><li> There's a more noticeable one in a filler episode special. Sakura says it's celebrating the show's fourth anniversary, which she also says in the dub... but because the dub aired episodes slightly faster (for a long time there was two episodes a week) it had been just over <em>three</em> years since it began American broadcast.
</li><li> Another minor one occurs during the final battle of the Wave Country Arc: Haku has Naruto and Sasuke trapped in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">the Demonic Ice Mirrors</a> and turns both of them into living pin cushions. Some of the needles sticking out of their bodies were edited out for the TV version, including all the ones in their necks. However, when Sasuke wakes up from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a>, there's still a scene of his pulling a needle out of <em>his neck</em>.
</li><li> In the German version, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">nobody is allowed to say "tot"</a>. Because of this the viewers never learn that Sasuke's clan was killed, which makes his whole character development and motivation non-understandable.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Spanish dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, the translators made some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">really random changes to the names of characters and places</a>. This includes changing the location of the whole Tokyo Arc to Kyoto, making for some really confusing moments (in the expository voiceover that opens the Steam Locomotive episode, Kaoru's voice actress explains the train run from Tokyo to Yokohama. They proceed to take the train... even though we've been told they were in Kyoto). When later in the series the action moves to Kyoto, they decided to call it "Edo", despite that just being an older name for Tokyo.
<ul><li> It's made even more confusing by the fact that they seemed to forget to change the names of the places once in a while, and as a result, when Kaoru and Yahiko leave in the steam boat, they mention they're leaving for Kyoto. Despite supposedly being there already.
</li><li> Also, they changed the names of the little girls from Suzume and Ayame to "Suzi" (pronounced in a weird, distinctively non-Spanish way) and "Yumi". Naturally, later on, they had to rename Yumi Komagata "Ayumi".
</li><li> The Brazilian dub has a similar problem, but a little worse: Tokyo, Edo, Kyoto and "Ayoya" (originally Aoi-ya) are used randomly, often being treated as if they were same thing (even the last one, which <em>isn't even a city</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> In the English dub of the fifth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, while running from an entire town's population trying to capture him for his bounty, Vash says "Until I find this man you're looking for, I have no choice but to keep moving!" This response makes no sense in any context, considering that Vash <em>is</em> the man they're looking for. The official subtitles (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarkHorseComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarkHorseComics">Dark Horse</a>'s translation of the manga) render this as "Until I see HIM again...", having Vash referring to his brother and series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Knives. Vash's line can also be translated as, "Until I find the man <em>I'm</em> looking for...".
</li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">episode shuffling</a>, the <em>Cardcaptors</em> dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> had Kero advising Sakura to use Windy, Fly, and Shadow to capture the Watery card because they were her oldest cards. In the actual anime, those were the only cards she had at the time. Even worse, an episode aired earlier showed Sakura as already possessing Watery. Continuity is for losers, yo.
<ul><li> The episode with Sakura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger">Doppelgänger</a> had Sakura use her captured Clow Cards to identify its nature. The card symbolizing what it was seeking was The Flower. This was intended to refer to her brother Toya, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">whose name meant "peach blossom"</a>, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a> to Tori meant Sakura somehow deduced this from a mere screenshot of Tori standing among cherry blossoms.
</li></ul></li><li> The Spanish translation for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> manga removes all mentions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHolidays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHolidays">White Day</a> (Or of there being a holiday like that) on the White Day <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">arc</a>, making it go from a standard High School plot to a random "let's return the St. Valentine chocolate for no reason" story. It becomes frustrating when you consider the same translator added a long explanation on Teru Teru Bouzu on another manga... where they get a 2-panel appearance for a quick joke. Those are some strange priorities.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>, the game club members often play Old Geezer. The English dub changes this to Old Maid, presumably because Western audiences are more likely to be familiar with the rules. It is unfortunate, then, that an important part of the climax of the second season is a speech about why it's so metaphorically significant that they play Old Geezer rather than Old Maid. One wonders how the dubbers will deal with that if <em>Higurashi Kai</em> is ever brought over.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em>Pokémon Special</em>, it is far more common to give your Pokémon nicknames than in other adaptations. In the first arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>, nicknames were all but ignored. This made a problem in the second arc, as Red's Pikachu, Pika, now with an expanded role, seems to have suddenly gotten one out of nowhere and everyone acted like it always had one. What more, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub">Inconsistent Dub</a> is in full effect, as Red's <em>other</em> Pokémon still aren't called by their nicknames and Yellow keeps switching from using her Pokémon's real names and nicknames. Even Pika.
</li><li> In the first Johto arc of <em>Pokémon Special</em>, Crys is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DopeSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DopeSlap">slapped across the face</a> by her mother after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">breaking down because she can't capture like she used to</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> changes this to a firm glare, yet leaves in the shocked expressions on the faces of Crys's Pokemon, Crys's shaking, and her holding her face a few panels later. It makes no attempt to explain why she is holding her cheek after being glared at.
</li><li> Great Balls have a tiny "S" stamped on them, while Ultra Balls have a large yellow "H". This is because the items are called "Super" and "Hyper" respectively in the original Japanese games.
</li><li> The day the Sinnoh Trio start their journey together is September 28th, the day the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Diamond and Pearl</a></em> games were released in Japan. The Viz translators caught on the reference and changed the date to April 22nd, the day the games were released in America. Unfortunately, winter is approaching Sinnoh, necessitating the change into the <em>Platinum</em> outfits. Apparently in Sinnoh, it starts snowing in May. Hokkaido, which is what Sinnoh is based off of, does have absurdly long winters, but May is still pushing it.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhere between Volumes 4 and 5 of the Tokyopop edition of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TogainuNoChi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TogainuNoChi">Togainu no Chi</a></em> manga, the translators noticed that the character they'd been calling "Nicole Prumier" was actually supposed to be "Nicole Premier". Since this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">plot-relevant</a>, they had to change it midstory.
</li><li> In the first series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA">OVAs</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Ridiculously Cute Critter</a> Ryo-Ohki is referred to as male in both the dubs and subtitles (no gender-specific pronouns are actually used in the Japanese dialogue, however). In the second series, she acquires a humanoid body which is clearly female, so the dub and subs shift to referring to her as female. There is also a mistake in the early episodes, again in both the dub and subtitles, where Tenchi refers to a woman as "grandma", who is later revealed to be his mother (the audio is not very clear in the scene in question, the woman has grey hair, and given that the Japanese words for "mother" and "grandmother" are very similar-sounding, it's understandable how this error occurred). None of these errors were corrected in later releases of the show, despite the voice cast being hired again to re-record some lines for the censored TV version.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> broadcast has a (quite minor) plot hole in Episode 7 as we're shown where everyone is that <em>isn't</em> the dinner table with Sasami's hard-cooked meal... except for Mihoshi. A cut scene revealed Mihoshi's location — dropping in on Tenchi and Washu "playing" "nurse". Against his will.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em> doesn't have these in its uncut dub. In the heavily edited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> broadcast, however...
<ul><li> In Episode 7, "Creeping Evil": Near the end of the episode, Gene gets hit in the back by a Pirate's "blaster". Back on board the Outlaw Star, Jim puts his hand on Gene's back and (originally) exclaims "What the hell is this?!" at the sight of blood on his hand. Lots of it. But the Toonami edit digitally removed the blood, turning the "Oh shit! Gene's bleeding to death!" moment into "Oh shit! I have a hand!" Equally inexplicably, Jim clearly says "hell"; future reruns changed it to "heck", but Jim's still freaked out by his palm. There's really no way the folks in charge of the Toonami edit could <em>not</em> have realized how nonsensical the edits worked out short of somehow editing it without actually watching it.
</li><li> Due to an excessive amount of fanservice and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">questionable material</a>, they removed an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode">Hot Springs Episode</a> from the Toonami run (editing it to what Standards and Practices required of them would have resulted in an episode clocking in at under 15 minutes, and <em>a lot</em> of digital paint; suffice to say it wasn't cost effective to even try). The problem is that the episode in question <em>wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a></em>; it involved Gene collecting difficult-to-find Caster shells, including some exceptionally rare ones that nobody knew actually still existed. The following episode opens with Gene sorting the shells out and mentioning off-hand how he got them, but the whole thing becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> with how they acquired this major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> for the final episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> Back when Saban's name was still attached to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, great pains were taken to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">remove any references of civilian death</a>. For example:
<ul><li> Saban's dub went out of its way to avoid admitting that Freeza and his men were killing the Namekians by removing bodies onscreen, cutting scenes of the killings as well as one of Gohan burying one village, editing the dialogue to refer to them as though they were still alive <em>and</em> adding random grunts and moans whenever a pile of dead Namekian corpses were onscreen. They didn't even bother with the usual "another/next/new dimension" explanation; they simply pretended that the Namekians weren't dead. This doesn't become so much of a plothole until they finally get around to wishing all of those killed by Freeza back to life. This was fixed when FUNimation re-dubbed said episodes.
</li><li> The dub claimed that when Piccolo and Kami went to the next dimension, the Dragon Balls went with them. Since they had functional Dragon Balls in the next dimension, why couldn't they just wish themselves and the other Z-Fighters back, instead of needing the surviving Z-Fighters to use Namek's Dragon Balls?
</li><li> In the Japanese version, Freeza kills the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> Namole who delivers the news of the Ginyu Force arriving because he showed fear. In the Funimation dub, Freeza instead kills Namole because he won't be needed with the Ginyu Force arriving, even though Freeza doesn't kill any of his other soldiers for this reason, including two other henchmen in <em>this very scene</em> who he lets live.
</li><li> Yet another of the many ways Saban tried to avoid directly referencing death was to use oblique references. This got awkward when Krillin complains about Vegeta almost letting him and Gohan "go the way of the dinosaur". Normally, this wouldn't be a problem... but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingDinosaurs">dinosaurs still exist</a> in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> universe, and both Krillin and Gohan have interacted with them. Because of this, Krillin's line makes no sense in-universe.
</li><li> According to the dub of the Android arc, Dr. Gero was the leader of the Red Ribbon Army who Goku had apparently spared long ago and "General" Tao wanted nothing more than world domination. In actuality, the Red Ribbon Army was led by Commander Red. Furthermore, Goku never met Gero during his childhood and Taopaipai was a <em>mercenary</em> who couldn't care less about world domination. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst">When they later dubbed</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, they didn't even attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> this, instead ignoring it completely.
</li><li> In the English dub, Goku specifically says his Instant Transmission technique moves him at the speed of light. Problem is, the speed of light is actually pretty slow when it comes to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">vast distances between solar systems</a> Goku uses it to travel. Ships capable of moving several times faster than light also exist in-universe, and at one point Goku would have been on one when he contemplated using the ability to beat Freeza back to Earth. In the Japanese version, no exact speed is ever attached to Instant Transmission, it's merely said to be, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">instantaneous</a>.
</li><li> Another detail that is dropped is that Goku can only use Instant Transmission to travel to places where he can sense the Ki of other living beings. This becomes an important plot point later on when Cell is threatening to blow up the Earth and Goku uses the technique to take him to King Kai's planet instead, saving the Earth at the cost of King Kai and his friends' lives. Originally, this was simply a pragmatic decision to take Cell where he'd do the least amount of damage possible. In the dub, however, there is no clear reason as to why Goku couldn't have just dropped him in the vacuum of space somewhere, making it look like he got some of his friends killed for no reason.
</li><li> How Cell regenerates may be an inversion. In the Japanese version, as he comes back from self-destructing, he says a special nerve in his head allows him to regenerate and if that nerve survives he can regenerate completely. But Goku had previously disintegrated everything above his waist, and he still regenerated from his <em>legs</em>. The dub worked around this by having him say he regenerates even if there's but a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">single</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">cell in his body</a>.
</li><li> Likewise inverted in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> dub, which attempts to make the retcon of King Piccolo and his spawn being aliens, rather than demons, less blatant by changing all references to them as demons to more vague terms such as "Piccolo's tribe". However, this leads to a straight example when King Piccolo says he's seen warriors from all over the <em>universe</em>, when it would later be established that the Namekian who would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality">become Kami and Piccolo</a> only lived on Namek until a young age before coming to Earth and never leaving.
</li><li> Also in the dub of <em>Dragon Ball</em>, the scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">Goku accidentally agrees to marry Chichi</a>, something she would end up coming back to take him up on at the 23rd Budokai tournament, was changed to just Chichi asking Goku if he'd be thinking about her. This was corrected for the most part by having Goku instead make a similar promise in a Red Ribbon Army Arc <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> episode where he sees Chichi and Ox King again ("What about the wedding?" "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsItSomethingYouEat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsItSomethingYouEat">I'll come back for some of that later!</a>"), but when Chichi reminds him of it at the tournament, the flashback is still to the original scene for no apparent reason.
</li><li> The French dub (and all the ones that spawned from it) has this in spades, because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">how terrible it was</a>. An example? They never call Vegeta or Freeza by name during a lot of episodes, until they suddenly do and Krillin knows both of their names because... he just does. Until then, Freeza was "the tyrant" and <em>every other bad guy</em> was "the enemy" (they were still called that for the whole Namek arc). Talk about confusing...
<ul><li> The same goes for the name Kakarrot, Goku's original birth name, which Vegeta always uses to refers to him. In the French dub, everybody calls him "Sangoku" at all times, Vegeta included. That is until one episode, in which Vegeta randomly starts mentioning the name "Cachalote". After that, it's back to calling him Sangoku again. Also, the less said about the amazing inconsistencies regarding the names and properties of the attacks and techniques the characters use, the better.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the French dub, Goku has no idea what a "Genki Ball" (Genki-dama in the Japanese and Latin American or Spirit Bomb in English versions) is until Vegeta tells him during their fight with Buu. Except that he has used it several times in the series (and movies) by that point. The dub also had problems with the Kaio-Ken attack and what it does - for instance, when Goku first reaches the Super Saiyan stage, he claims he has been empowered by King Kai, which is what the dub interpreted the Kaio-Ken technique as.
</li><li> The word "Android" was used in place of a more ambiguous Japanese word meaning "artificial human". The English dub initially changed 17 and 18 from human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">cyborgs</a> to purely machine, but reversed it when they realized that in later episodes, Krillin and 18 had a daughter.
<ul><li> <em>Jinzōningen</em>, the word used to describe them as well as other Red Ribbon creations, has no direct translation, but is often approximated to "Android." This would not be a problem, but the ambiguity does not carry over to the actual characters, where some are explicitly stated to be purely mechanical robots (and thus androids) while others (such as 17, 18, and 20) are explicitly stated to be heavily augmented humans.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the more infamous scenes in the Saban dub involved Vegeta telling Goku that his father Bardock was "an average fighter, but a brilliant scientist" who invented a technique to generate an artificial moon that would let Saiyans transform into their Great Ape form even on planets without moons. This was wholly an invention of the Saban dub's writing staff; in the original Japanese, Vegeta was explaining the mechanics of the Great Ape transformation. However, the Bardock-centric special <em>The Father of Goku</em> showed him as a powerful but low-class warrior<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vdhz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5vdhz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vdhz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which, ironically enough, meant he couldn't even use the artificial moon technique himself — only Saiyan elites like Vegeta knew how to do it</span>. When FUNimation went back to the Saiyan and Namek arcs in 2004 when Pioneer's (who distributed those episodes on home video) right's expired, they corrected this mistake.
</li><li> Additionally in the same episode while Goku tries to stay away from giant ape Vegeta, he has some flashbacks where his Grandpa Gohan tells him not to get out during full-moon nights because "a giant monster appears" and also when Kami cuts off his tail so "it won't get in the way while he fights". These make them realize that he too could transform into a giant ape and killed his grandpa accidentally. The dub ROYALLY screwed up the dialogues: Goku "realizes" that Vegeta is the one who destroyed the Martial Arts tournament and stepped on his grandfather, despite the fact that those instances happened years ago and Vegeta hadn't even <em>heard</em> of Earth until fairly recently. In the original (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em>), Goku realizes that it was him who killed Grandpa Gohan and wrecked the World Martial Arts Tournament grounds, and swears to make up for it by defeating Vegeta.
</li><li> The fifth episode of the original anime has Bulma lose her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Hoi-Poi capsules</a>. In the Japanese version, she simply drops them in the river, while in the English dub, she accuses Oolong of stealing them, which he doesn't deny. This leads to the obvious question of why Bulma simply doesn't search him and get them back.
</li><li> In the Hungarian dub, during the Garlic Jr. Saga (or Garbig, as the dub calls him), Gohan is stated to be 5 years old. That cannot be, as he was 4 at the start of the series, and several years have explicitly passed since then. This may or may not have been the result of working with the confusing French script.
</li><li> Two other examples from the French dub: the Serpent Road is said to be 100 km long instead of a million. Thus it comes off as bizarre that it takes Goku months to traverse it. In another scene, Vegeta claims that the "Space Warriors" (Saiyans) can take on any form they want under moonlight. Actually, they become giant apes when exposed to it.
</li><li> In Saban's dub, Tienshinhan infamously remarks that his arm will eventually grow back after Nappa rips it. Thing is, Tien is not Namekean like Piccolo.
</li><li> The infamous "Big Green Dub" version of <em>The History of Trunks</em> has the narrator claim that Vegeta, Tien, Yamcha and Krillin survived the Androids' initial attack. Needless to say, this raised the obvious question about why they don't play a role in the main story.
</li><li> Episode 92 of the original <em>Dragon Ball</em> in the Latin American dub shows Krillin referring to Jackie Chun as Master Roshi, even though he's not supposed to know Jackie really is Roshi.
<ul><li> And in Episode 105, when Cymbal arrives to where Goku and Yajirobe are, Goku asks Cymbal if he knows Tambourine. When Cymbal replies, instead of referring to Tambourine, he's referring to himself.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VisionOfEscaflowne">Vision of Escaflowne</a></em> has a character mention in the second episode that Zaibach are the ones attacking Fanelia. However, we aren't supposed to know it's them until Episode 3, and even in the dub, everyone's supposed to be surprised when they find out Zaibach did it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots">Medabots</a></em> had a couple of these:
<ul><li> Medabots suffered an awful reshuffle of episodes. Actually, for the first "season" the company skipped the episodes that it considered uninteresting, only to insert them as the first episodes of "season 2". The problem here was that in the end of season 1 Ikki and Metabee had only a week before the International Robattle Championship, but it only started 14 episodes after said announcement. The dub could have solved the matter by simply saying that it was delayed, but it didn't.
</li><li> In the same reshuffling, Rokusho shows up in many of the first episodes of "Season 2", regardless of the fact that he had a dramatic goodbye in "Season 1" to find his reason of living. No one seems to be even a little surprised to see him again, or that he is suddenly wearing his old cape again despite receiving a new one from Karin.
</li><li> Two different episodes have Ikki battling a member of the Rubberobo Gang under the latter's true identity. The first match ended up being cut while the second has him mention that they'd already battled once.
</li><li> Another plot hole created by the reshuffle is the upgrade of Spike's Medabot from Cyandog to Bluesdog/Krosserdog. Spike starts out with Cyandog, who is then suddenly replaced with Krosserdog without any explanation, then goes back to being Cyandog, and then gets an episode dedicated to him receiving his upgrade to Krosserdog.
</li><li> A more straightforward and non-related to episode shuffling case was Metabee's naming. In the first episode, after getting his Medabot, Ikki named him Metabee. Some 50 episodes later, someone comments that the Medabot responsible for a horrible incident was also named Metabee — then Ikki rushes to the store saying that it was Henry, co-worker in said store, who named Metabee (cue a flashback with altered dialogue).
</li></ul></li><li> The Scandinavian dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin">Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin</a></em> contain massive plotholes because a lot of the violence was cut (mostly character deaths), as well as numerous plot-important scenes with no violence whatsoever. The show never was dubbed into English despite many rumors suggesting it would  and likely with similar massive cuts.
<ul><li> Most obvious must be the final episode. Here, Akakabuto dies from being shot by Gohei. Gin's father is seen being completely OK all this time, even watching over now dead Akakabuto. Suddenly, he's dying from massive wounds... it was very confusing to watch as a child. Additionally, Ben's voice in the Finnish dub changes early on, and his original voice later makes a comeback as Moss. Also, Smith changes his voice AND sex midway through the dub.
</li><li> Then there's Benizakura, who was introduced as the strongest dog in the world and whose recruitment to the cause was a big deal. His death, a heroic sacrifice in which he ensured the death of one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s strongest underlings, and the fight leading to it were completely cut. However, they left in a bit later where another dog's thoughts briefly turn to Benizakura not being with them any longer, but doesn't go into detail about what happened to him. Such an important warrior just vanishing without a trace was confusing to say the least.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersHeadmasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersHeadmasters">Headmasters</a></em>, Scorponok manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">blow up</a> both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mars">Mars</a> and Cybertron. In the English dub of the final episode, Fortress Maximus mentions that they can rebuild Mars, a line which wasn't in the Japanese version. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersVictory">Victory</a></em>, which is set about 15 years later, Earth apparently has a massive mining operation on Mars  but if Mars could be rebuilt, why does nobody ever mention Cybertron?
</li><li> In <em>Galaxy Force</em>, a mysterious black hole appears next to Cybertron and sucks the planet in; however, in later episodes, characters walk around on the surface without difficulty. When it was redubbed into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Cybertron</a></em>, the situation was changed to Cybertron just being perilously close to the black hole. Unfortunately, the translators also decided that the black hole was formed from the death of Unicron at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon">Energon</a></em>, making <em>Cybertron</em> a sequel, while in the Japanese continuity it was unconnected to any previous series<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6qas2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6qas2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6qas2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Takara has since declared that <em>Galaxy Force</em> is in continuity with <em>Super Link</em>. It's best not to think too hard about <em>Transformers</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity">continuity</a></span>. This meant a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canonically</a> dead characters suddenly appeared alive and well (explained as a result of the Unicron Singularity messing with the space-time continuum) and the Autobots not being familiar with combination, despite the fact that this was a frequent occurrence in <em>Energon</em>.
</li><li> A particularly oddball one from the Unicron Trilogy-era stuff: in the original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em>, Megatron gets a power boost that also changes his colors, and calls it "Megatron <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>." The English dub changed it to Galvatron, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> to the original series. Then in the sequel series, Megatron was resurrected, and changed his name to Galvatron (even gaining a G1 Galvatron-esque body). Out of a desire to maintain the trademark and the more marketable name, the English dub had him instead change his name <em>back</em> to Megatron, and then had his later upgrade to Galvatron General being him going back to Galvatron again. Add in the abovementioned problems of folding <em>Galaxy Force</em> into being a sequel, and you have it going from "Megatron&gt;Megatron Super Mode&gt;Galvatron&gt;Galvatron General" and the different character "Master Megatron&gt;Master Galvatron" to "Megatron&gt;Galvatron&gt;Megatron&gt;Galvatron&gt;Megatron&gt;Galvatron." Apparently, in American continuity, Megatron just alternates names whenever he gets an upgrade.
</li></ul></li><li> The English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Stitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Stitch">Stitch!</a></em> tries shoehorning it to the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></em> continuity by lines explaining Stitch left out of jealousy of a new boyfriend of Lilo's. What the hell happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">Ohana</a>? Since then, the series has been turned into a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch">the franchise</a>, with Lilo having gone to college being responsible for Stitch leaving, and the two reuniting years later where Lilo is now a mother with an identical looking child.
</li><li> In the first English adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a></em>, known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleOfThePlanets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleOfThePlanets">Battle of the Planets</a></em>, the producers were sent episodes of the anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfOrder">Out of Order</a> and decided to dub and translate them as they went. This produced quite a number of plot holes, especially when it came time for them to adapt certain other episodes. Whether you watch this version in Sandy Frank's suggested order or the original Gatchaman order, things just do <em>not</em> add up either way. Especially if you're Mark's "friend"/mentor/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">father</span> Colonel Cronus and they can't decide if you're alive, dead, or the circumstances of your death.
<ul><li> Saban's attempt at dubbing both Gatchaman sequels as <em>Eagle Riders</em> created its own plot hole. The villain "Mallanox" (originally the female Gel Sadra) was said to be a man and an alien specifically created/summoned by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> "Cybercon" (Leader X), with their original backstory cut due to the violence involved in it. Then it was said that he was the son of an alien named "Lukan" (originally Gatchaman's Berg Katse) and a human woman. Then, as Saban realized that cutting Gel Sadra's backstory was coming back to bite them, they attempted to reinstate it and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> Mallanox as actually being a woman with a manly voice when in costume (and the daughter of a female professor and her husband, the latter who was killed in the ship bombing she was kidnapped in). Then when it came time for Gel Sadra to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">die and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoOutWithASmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoOutWithASmile">Go Out with a Smile</a></span>, Saban instead changed the dialogue of the scene to suggest that Cybercon still had control over Mallanox and was transforming him/her for their failure... into the villain of Gatchaman Fighter (Count Egobossler). Who they proceeded to rename <em>Happy Boy</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> manga states that nobody knows where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Militant</a> Alexander Anderson is from. The English anime dub opened a hole by giving him a very obvious Scottish accent (the voice actor was from Dundee and only slightly exaggerated his natural brogue), making it sound like those who say this never met anyone who hadn't grown up more than ten miles away from them.
<ul><li> The official English translation of the manga gives Anderson pretty much the same accent, or at least as can best be approximated in text.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Episode 44 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em>, Bido recognizes the reincarnated Greed by his voice. In the original Japanese, both Greeds are voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuuichiNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuuichiNakamura">Yuuichi Nakamura</a>, but in the dub, the second Greed has a different voice actor than the first and the two sound almost nothing alike. This could be justified in that Bido recognizes the second Greed through his Ultimate Shield and catchphrase. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7eqoe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7eqoe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7eqoe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The English manga even has Bido recognize the simlarities between the "condescending laugh" of the first Greed and the second, so he might have recognized him there too.</span>
</li><li> From the ending episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a> this gem happens. In Funimation's subtitles Al <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">proclaims that Ed "hasn't been dead for long" before attempting to bring him back; in the actual Japanese dialogue, Al says that Ed "isn't dead yet", as his soul has not passed through the Gate. Therefore, what Al does to bring Ed back is not human transmutation, but rather the equivalent of Ed's retrieval and binding of Al's soul after they failed to transmute their mother. The difference in phrasing may seem minor, but considering the series has just spent the past 50 episodes establishing that bringing back the dead is not only a very bad idea, but not even possible, it's a pretty important distinction to make. Misinterpretation of this scene has led some viewers to conclude that the final episode contains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>. Oddly enough, the second part of the same line contains what appears to be a Plot Hole in the subtitle translation, but was fixed in the dub; Al determines that Ed isn't dead yet because "he's still warm", even though it has already been well established that Al is incapable of tactile sensation. In the dub, he says that "there's still some color in his face", which makes more sense. Whether this is an error in Funimation's subtitle translation or an oversight in the original script is unclear.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba">Yotsuba&amp;!</a></em>, when Fuuka asks what Yotsuba's adoptive father does, Yotsuba goes and asks him. He says he's a <em>honyakuka</em>, or translator. Yotsuba comes back and calls him a <em>konnyakuka</em>, someone who makes konjac gel. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Manga's</a> version, however, she says he's a "trainspotter". This is all well and good... until 17 chapters later, when Fuuka seems to be under the impression that he knows a lot about <em>konjac</em> for what looks, to readers of ADV's otherwise-superior English translation, to be no apparent reason.
</li><li> The last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hamtaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hamtaro">Hamtaro</a></em> to be dubbed ("<em>Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Games</em>") and aired onto North American television was ACTUALLY a special from <em>at least two seasons ahead</em> of where the series currently was. The special was dubbed to go along with the 2004 Olympics. However this didn't change the fact that there were a TON of new characters that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">the Ham-Hams just seemed to "know."</a>
</li><li> At the end of the Rescue arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, as the three traitor captains escaped to Hueco Mundo, Gin Ichimaru originally apologised to Rangiku Matsumoto for an unspecified reason. In the dub, this was changed into him saying 'maybe next time'. The apology turns out to be very important to Gin's character motivations in a later arc.
<ul><li> Before fighting Yumichika, Hisagi tells him "You'll die either way." A few episodes later, he has apparently defeated Yumichika, and when Yumichika insists on resuming the battle, Hisagi tells him he's beaten, and shows no desire to finish him off.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akira</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em> is actually a cross dressing female. This fact isn't revealed until much later in the series. Someone didn't tell the German dubbers this, as they left her with a distinctly male voice, which made the reveal a tad complicated.
</li><li> An odd one occurs in <em>Case Closed</em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> inserted a line intended to fix an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">Adaptation-Induced Plot Hole</a> in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> anime by having Harley (Heiji) tip Jimmy (Shinichi) off about Vodka and Gin's codenames, which Conan somehow knows in the original Japanese version a few episodes later despite never having a chance to learn this. By adding this line, Harley implies that he knows the truth about Jimmy being Conan. However, this line creates a plot hole in Harley's next appearance where he clearly has no idea that Conan is Jimmy until figuring it out during that case.
</li><li> The English dub of <em>Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend</em> was heavily cut to secure an NC-17 rating. In one cut scene, the protagonist learned that ingesting the blood or any other bodily fluid of a demon would bring out his hidden power. So in the dub, when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">gobbles a demon's man chowder</a>, he seems to do it for no reason.
</li><li> In Viz's translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>, Shin's martial art style of <em>Nanto Seiken</em> (South Dipper Holy Fist) was renamed the "Sacred Fist of the Southern Cross". This creates a plot hole when Kenshiro infiltrates the Kingsmen's hideout of Southern Cross. It shouldn't take him that long to deduce the identity of the Kingsmen's leader when he named his own city after his martial art school.
</li><li> This crops up a few times in Keith Giffen's adaptation of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BattleRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BattleRoyale">Battle Royale</a></em> manga, due to his refusal to even attempt to keep his script anywhere near the translation.
<ul><li> In Giffen's version, the Program is a reality TV show, based on the logic that if you're going to do something like make kids kill each other you might as well make money off it. A number of times it's alluded to that multiple cameras are on most if not all of the kids around the clock no matter where they are. This breaks the climax of the story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Kawada fakes killing Noriko and Shuya by staging it in a heavily forested area so that they can't be seen by satellite imaging. You have to do some mental gymnastics to justify the lack of normal cameras in the area.</span>
</li><li> The concept that the Program is being televised also causes other plot holes. Shinji's first attempt to shut the Program down by hacking into the computer systems is foiled because he doesn't realise the students' collars are wired for sound; in the English translation, this goes from being a foolish oversight on his part to making no sense whatsoever that he didn't think of it.
</li><li> Giffen also managed to contradict an element that <em>he himself</em> had invented in the first place. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kiriyama is shot in the head</span>, his brain damage is partially reversed, causing him to feel emotions for the first time since he was a kid. In the English manga, he also regains his ability to see colors, having been completely colorblind up until then. Previously in the English version, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kiriyama</span> made an off-hand reference to the redness of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his victims' blood</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>, Mikado Ryugamine's name translates to "Emperor of the Dragon's Peak". This causes a lot of people to make fun of him or get weirded out, as they think his name is very strange and pretentious. The English dub does not include the translation, so the English viewers are left scratching their heads over why everybody is making fun of his name, especially since everyone else also has Japanese names.
</li><li> Borderline example: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>, Nanami spends one episode proudly wearing a cowbell, thinking it's some hip new kind of jewelry because the word "cowbell" in Japanese is simply the English word (<em>kaoberu</em>). The English dub just keeps it that way, and since everyone's speaking English it seems pretty odd that Nanami has to have explained to her "It's a cowbell, as in a bell a cow wears!" Although it still works as a satire of people who wear weird things just because they're from some big designer.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RoninWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RoninWarriors">Ronin Warriors</a></em> series, there's a scene where one of the main cast wins the lottery. Events transpire such that this member has to spend all of the lottery money buying implements for the cast, and bailing people out of jail. The problem comes in the dub, where it's implied that the person won millions of dollars, and went broke buying a few plane tickets. In the captioning, the situation becomes more clear, as the person only won 3000 or so dollars.
</li><li> A minor one occurs at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em>, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Char's ghost briefly appears before crossing over into the afterlife.</span> In the original Japanese, both Char and Full Frontal were always voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShuichiIkeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShuichiIkeda">Shuichi Ikeda</a>, but in English Frontal was played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithSilverstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithSilverstein">Keith Silverstein</a>, not any of the three other men who had portrayed Char in previous <em>Gundam</em> dubs. Despite this, Silverstein still played <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Char's ghost</span> in <em>Unicorn</em>, which made the scene a bit confusing, seeming like it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Full Frontal's ghost, when the Japanese version seems to imply he doesn't have a soul</span>. This has since been addressed retroactively by casting Silverstein as Char in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin">Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin</a></em> movie dubs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DemashitaPowerpuffGirlsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DemashitaPowerpuffGirlsZ">Demashita! Powerpuff Girls Z</a></em> has this with the dub versions of both episodes featuring Miyako/Bubbles' boyfriend Takaaki. The original Japanese version established that Takaaki was in the hospital for 7 years because of a critical heart condition, but the English dub (which also changes his name to Cody) changes it so that he was sent to the hospital recently because of a broken ankle. The change is contradicted in the dubbed version of the character's second appearance, which ignores the broken ankle change to follow the heart condition established in the Japanese version.
</li><li> The English dub of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD">High School Dx D</a></em> anime has Issei routinely calling Rias by her name, instead of Buchou (or "Prez", as in President of the Occult Research Club) as he does in the novels and other adaptions. The problem is that Issei's refusal to use her name is the cornerstone of their character arc heading into the third season.
</li><li> A minor example appears in the English translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, with the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName">Pantyhose Taro</a>. The character's whole driving arc is how much he hates his name and wants it changed, but by the laws of his village, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Happosai</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude">who named him that in the first place</a>, can change it. And Happosai refuses. At this point, most English readers/viewers start thinking "well, why doesn't he just not use his first name?" This is because, in the original Japanese, the "Pantyhose" part of his name is a prefix, not a seperate word in its own right, but that can't be accurately conveyed in the language translation. So in the original Japanese, trying to leave it out would be like having the name "Bob" but asking people to call him "ob".
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> Whisper mentions that Yo-kai Watches can never be removed. This is despite it frequently being shown off of Nate.
<ul><li> Later in the series, the English dub skipped over an episode introducing the Song Medals (likely so they didn't have to dub the songs for a product that wasn't being sold in stores). However, additional song medals would show up in episodes that did air.
</li></ul></li><li> Episode 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em> has Mizore attacking the gym teacher, Kotsubo, which causes her to be suspended. When the Newspaper Club asks how they know it was her, Kagome-sensei explains that Mizore herself said she did it. The dub changes this to Kotsubo saying she did it, which leads the audience to wonder "How do they know he's not lying?"
</li><li> The English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gigantor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gigantor">Gigantor</a></em> has the series take place in the 21st century instead of just after World War 2, probably to explain the giant robot. There are no attempts to explain why everything looks 1940s.
</li><li> In the Filipino dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em>, Kyoji Kashu's first name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">is changed</a> to George despite the series already having a <em>George</em> de Sand, who is in turn renamed Joraque. Speaking of Kyoji, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Master Asia's surprised reaction to Scwartz's first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticUnmask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticUnmask">Dramatic Unmask</a> in Episode 23 was completed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">Say My Name</a> ("Ikaw si...

See previous entry regarding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a>.</span>), thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat">spoiling</a> the twist <em>way</em> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> in both Episodes 40 and 44. In both the English and original Japanese, Master Asia only gave a simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe">This Cannot Be!</a> reaction ("While you're...! It can't be...!").</span>
</li><li> The dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard">Cardfight!! Vanguard</a></em> completely skips the Legion Mate arc, and the movie Neon Messiah with it, jumping straight to Vanguard G. In addition to characters appearing out of nowhere that the old cast somehow knows (including Ibuki, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the movie who occasionally acts like an antagonistic mentor to new protagonist Chrono), the dub also makes no attempt to explain why random minor fighters can use the Link Joker clan without being corrupted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>:
<ul><li> Midway through the series, the two characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Porlyusica and Grandeeney</span> are revealed to be counterparts to each other from parallel worlds, evidenced by their shared Japanese actors in the anime. However, due to the English dub's policy to avoid reusing actors more than the Japanese version, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo">Acting for Two</a> between unrelated characters is more common, the dub mistakenly cast two distinctly different actors for each part, which poses a problem when Wendy recognizes their shared voices. From that point on, one of the parts was recast to match the other.
<ul><li> Narrowly avoided in the case of King Faust, originally played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherMarty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherMarty">a different actor</a> who recorded dialogue that was included in a DVD trailer for episodes containing his debut. Due to a twist in the next set of episodes revealing Faust to be Makarov's counterpart, however, all of his lines were re-recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RBruceElliott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RBruceElliott">R. Bruce Elliott</a> at the last minute.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Grand Magic Games arc, a female time traveler is introduced in the same scene where Princess Hisui reveals she was forewarned of impending doom by a mysterious adviser from the future. The Japanese language doesn't employ gender-specific pronouns as frequently as other languages, so most official manga translations and anime subtitles could be forgiven for calling Hisui's adviser a "she", if not for the twist that the time traveler Hisui met was not only a totally different person, but a man. The anime's English dub tries working around this by using the gender-neutral "they", but that in itself only raises the question of why the specific pronoun wasn't used outright other than to preserve the twist.
</li><li> The official localization of the manga initially calls the demons of the book of Zeref <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">"Aetherious" rather than "Etherious"</a>. This caused problems at the end of the arc, where it's revealed that E.N.D., the name for the strongest demon Zeref ever created, contains the initial for "Etherious", which obviously makes no sense if it's spelled with an A.
</li><li> The English dub of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zeref</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Mavis</a>'s first conversation seen in the series makes it seem as though they've been mortal enemies for some time when Mavis was alive, if not for as long as they've known each other. However, later chapters and the prequel series <em>Fairy Tail Zero</em> show that any true contention between them only began <em>after</em> Mavis died and became a spirit Zeref could neither see nor hear, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">they were good friends right down to Mavis's final moments</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and also made love shortly beforehand, which is what caused her death in the first place</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a></em> is called by three names in Japan, his earth name, Aiba Takaya(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Nick Carter</a> in the dub, hardly ever used), his Tekkaman name, Blade, used mostly by evil Tekkamen, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseNickname">In-Universe Nickname</a> D-Boy, used by Space Knights. In dub he has only two, as both Space Knights and villains call him Blade. For the most part it's not a problem, but late in the series Blade starts losing memories, and forgets that Space Knights call him D-Boy, insisting on being called Takaya. In the dub he forgets that he's called Blade, which leads to weird situations; when being called that by his girlfriend he acts confused, yet a few scenes later he's called that by villains with no problem.
<ul><li> Late into the first half of the series, Evil is joined by three Tekkamen, Axe, Lance, and Sword. Blade's sister Miyuki also shows up as Tekkaman Rapier. In the U.S. dub, Lance and Sword were renamed Rapier and Lance respectively. Miyuki's counterpart Shara was not given a name for her Tekkaman form. The plot hole comes with Lance. He clearly introduces himself as "Teknoman Lance", but in the original Sword was a woman who featured quite prominently in the second half of the series. The U.S. dub ended at Episode 26, however, so it never became a problem.
</li></ul></li><li> The Italian dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars">Pretty Cure All Stars</a> DX 2</em> was released <em>after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">HeartCatch Pretty Cure!</a></em> was finished being aired, thus they tossed in a throwaway line stating that Itsuki and Yuri (whom neither was fully introduced when <em>DX 2</em> was released in Japan) couldn't show up due to other commitments (Itsuki had a karate tournament and Yuri was sick). Except, well... they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo">a cameo appearance</a>.
</li><li> In the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan">Bakugan New Vestroia</a></em>, Ingram <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan">is changed to a girl</a> for the first half, despite clearly looking like a boy. That's not much of a problem until she evolves to Master Ingram and gets a gender change out of nowhere.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Viz translation of the manga, Kaguya refers to Shirogane by his last name instead of "President" and is on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> with Fujiwara. Both of these lead plot holes in Volume 6, since Kaguya mentions in Chapter 52 that Kei was the first person she was ever on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> with, and her inability to call Shirogane anything other that "president" in Chapter 60 set the entire re-election arc in motion. The official subs for the first episode of anime had the same issue, but fan outcry resulted in it being changed to be closer to the original script. This is, additional to the fact that Japanese customs denote the level of formality in addressing a peer, the person's title being the most formal form of address, followed by the last name, while the least formal would be the first-name basis. Kaguya never addresses Shirogane by either his first or last name, as it would denote a level of fondness for him that she does not want to either admit or relent.
</li><li> Another one occurs in Volume 9: When Otomo shows up at the sports festival to berate Ishigami, he ends up telling her off by responding "Shut up, stupid." This leads to a follow-up joke where one of Otomo's friends admits that she IS kind of an idiot, and Otomo herself reluctantly agrees on the basis that she failed the advancement exam to get into Shuchi'in's high school. The English translation changes Ishigami's retort to "Go to hell, jerk," but retains the follow-up jokes, making it sound like Otomo's friend agrees that she's a jerk, and that Otomo failed her exams because she's a jerk, effectively ruining the whole bit. To make it even worse, the line was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho">Meaningful Echo</a> of something he had said back in Volume 4 (a line they <em>had</em> properly translated), so that extra meaning is also lost.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombielandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombielandSaga">Zombieland Saga</a></em>, Saki is said to have been the captain of the special attack unit of the motorcycle gang Dorami, which the subtitles somehow conflated into being the captain of Dorami period. This became a major problem when, come her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>, we meet the <em>actual</em> captain of Dorami, whose position is what the plot hinges on; specifically, the captain's daughter wants to inherit her mother's position. Whoops.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>,
<ul><li> Yuu and Touko, the main couple, are initially on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Last-Name Basis</a>; Yuu calls Touko "Nanami-sempai," while Touko calls Yuu "Koito-san" (or "Yuu" if she's in a playful/flirty mood). Early on in the series, Touko asks for permission to call Yuu by her first name, and Yuu nonchalantly says yes, resulting in Sayaka getting jealous when she notices Touko using Yuu's first name at a student council meeting. The dub has all the characters on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> with each other, except for those whose first names aren't used in the show (Maki, Doujima, Ichigaya), so Touko had always called Yuu by her first name, even around Sayaka.
</li><li> Early on, Yuu overhears a conversation between two teachers about Touko's candidacy for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>, and one of them says that "she" would likely be happy, strongly implying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Touko's deceased sister Mio</span>. In the dub, the teacher refers to "her friend," presumably implying Yuu or Sayaka and omitting a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>.
</li><li> In the last chapter, Touko teases Yuu about her calling Touko "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SempaiKohai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SempaiKohai">sempai</a>" while eating at the cafe with Sayaka, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuu had switched to calling Touko by her first name after they started going out, and dropped the "sempai" after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime">Their First Time</a></span>. In a fan translation of the manga, Yuu never addressed Touko by name during that scene, so Touko's remark doesn't make much sense.
</li></ul></li><li> The German Dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegamanNTWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegamanNTWarrior">Megaman NT Warrior</a></em> only dubbed 43 episodes out of the 56 the first "season" consists of. While a few of the undubbed episodes are just filler and don't affect the season's plotline one way or the other, others are quite important, like the episode that introduced Tory Froid (Iceman's operator) to the cast, the episode where Lan spends a day with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">incognito</a> Princess Pride (who later appears in another episode, leaving viewers to wonder how she knows Lan), or the episode where Rush appeared in the real world for the first time (something that occurs regularily from that point on, leaving viewers to wonder why everyone accepts it as normal).
</li><li> A minor case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NewGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NewGame">New Game!</a></em>. When Naru first meets Nene, they hit it off well, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">call each other "Nenecchi" and "Narucchi."</a> After Naru learns that Nene mainly got hired due to connections with their boss, she ends the conversation by emphatically calling Nene "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Sakura-san</a>," which, while polite, signifies that she doesn't want to be friends with Nene, until she later apologizes and starts using Nene's nickname again at the latter's request. While the English dub has Naru call Nene "Sakura" between that conversation and their reconciliation, it omits the first time Nene switched modes of address.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> in Episode 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove">Asteroid in Love</a></em>. When Misa sets up a shrine for Mira's banded stone, she says "Still, an asteroid, huh? Mira's set a big dream for herself." This indicates Misa never knew Mira takes asteroid discovery as the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoalInLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoalInLife">Goal in Life</a>. However the same chapter also establishes that Misa knows well about the past between Mira and Ao, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise">which is why the asteroid thing exists in the first place</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a>'s dub changes that line to "[Mira] still wants an asteroid", meaning Misa knows it all along, thus fixes the hole.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin">Tintin</a></em> comics were translated into English out-of-sequence. Translators altered the dialogue to try to give a sense of continuity to the "new" sequence, leading to problems such as characters the heroes already "knew" being introduced. Also, of course, if the books are placed in proper sequence, some of the dialogue just doesn't make any sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a> phrase explaining Obelix's permanent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> is translated as "he fell into a cauldron of magic potion when he was <em>a baby</em>", probably to play on the old cliché about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage">falling on one's head as a baby</a>. The original phrase is more ambiguous and literally means "he fell into a cauldron of magic potion when he was <em>small</em>". This caused some problem when a book explaining the story of how Obelix fell into the potion was released, showing him as a child of about four or five years old. The translation just pushed past this and titled the book <em>How Obelix Fell into the Magic Potion When He Was a Little Boy</em>.
</li><li> In <em>The Big Fight</em>, Obelix and Asterix sing a punny song while carrying a fallen tree. The English translation turned this into a parody of "John Brown's Body", with them singing "Pompey's body lies a-mouldering in the grave" (this seems reasonable, as the comic also shows Julius Caesar as Dictator, suggesting Pompey is dead by this point). Many years later in <em>Asterix and the Actress</em>, Pompey is a very important character, as his attempts to gather supporters to take on Caesar are the whole reason the story happens. He is, of course, alive.
</li><li> In <em>Asterix and Obelix's Birthday</em> we see a crossword that joins up ASTERIX and OBELIX with IDEFIX (between the I of Asterix and the X of Obelix). The dog's name was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">changed to Dogmatix</a> in English, so it was impossible to change the drawing. The clue section is changed to read "Dog's idea" riffing off the literal meaning of "dogmatics" and "idée fixe", but it's incredibly tenuous. It would be an excellent cryptic crossword clue in a general setting, though. (It should be noted the English translator is the daughter of a cryptic crossword designer.)
</li><li> Also in <em>Birthday</em> a short story involves Getafix teaching Obelix how to read, and showing what the letters stand for: <em>A pour âne</em> (donkey) and <em>B pour biche</em> (doe). While "âne" is perfectly translated as "ass", "biche" is translated as "buck", as neither "doe" nor "deer" begin with a B. The drawing still shows an obviously female deer, even though it could have easily been changed by the addition of antlers.
</li><li> In the English translation of <em>Asterix the Gladiator</em>, the pirates remark after their ship sinks that the Gauls never miss the boat, even though this is the first time the pirates appear in the series, and clearly have not met Asterix and Obelix before since they eagerly attacked a ship with them in plain sight.
</li></ul></li><li> Many English translations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valerian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valerian">Valérian</a></em> were made decades after the comic was originally released, but the translators try to present the 20th-century Earth segments as if they are taking place in the present day, resulting in bizarre anachronisms, like Euros being used as a currency while the Cold War is still going on.

<ul><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBraveLittleToaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBraveLittleToaster">The Brave Little Toaster</a></em> was shown on Polish television, some scenes that were kept in the original release were removed. One of them was the forest scene, which was one of the most crucial ones. It was most likely cut for the possibility of scaring younger audience; in the TV release it just cuts to the waterfall scene without explaining at all why Lampy's bulb is broken. Other scenes edited out from the TV version include the Air Conditioner's exploding rage and the appliances catching the "On Sale" sign. For some reason, they also omitted the scene where Lampy tries to think of ways they could try and get out of the house to find the Master. All of these scenes remain intact on the Polish DVD release.
</li><li> Naturally, this is the case when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls1">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls</a></em> received a Japanese dub that was released on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a>. Japanese viewers may be confused as to where Twilight suddenly got wings from, and why she suddenly has a crown and is a princess. Of course, since Season 3 of <em>Friendship Is Magic</em> had yet to air in Japan, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E13MagicalMysteryCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E13MagicalMysteryCure">explains everything</a>, this left a major plot hole in <em>Equestria Girls</em>' Japanese Dub. It got worse when <em>Rainbow Rocks</em> and <em>Friendship Games</em> were quickly and subsequently released in the region. <em>Rainbow Rocks</em> features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E26TwilightsKingdomPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E26TwilightsKingdomPart2">Twilight's new castle</a>, and <em>Friendship Games</em> has a scene in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stinger">Stinger</a> mentioning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E26TheCutieRemarkPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E26TheCutieRemarkPart2">Twilight's time-travelling adventures</a>. Naturally, since Seasons 3 and beyond have yet to come to Japan, this turned a mere plot hole into a plot <em>canyon</em> for Japanese viewers. Needless to say, many Japanese fans are not happy that the <em>Equestria Girls</em> films have been dubbed before the rest of <em>Friendship Is Magic</em> and have even boycotted this move by watching Japanese fansubbed versions of the original show in English online instead. This hasn't deterred anything it seems, as <em>Legend of Everfree</em> and the <em>Magical Movie Night</em> special were still released in Japan. Speaking of the latter, it features <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Starlight Glimmer</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarthDebutedInSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarthDebutedInSmashBros">effectively making it her debut</a> to Japanese audiences (and <em>not</em> her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">villainous self</a> in "The Cutie Map"), thus expanding the plot holes even wider.

Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stating that the movie takes place between Seasons 7 and 8, the movie itself outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">ignores and glosses over</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">the major developments</a> that has occurred in the show since Season 2, it can go <em>anywhere</em> within the continuity and actually <em>avoids</em> any plot holes aside from the major ones already mentioned above.

</li><li> Inconsistencies arise between the English dubs of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> series' Kiryu dualogy, the only two closely linked entries in the Millennium series. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaAgainstMechagodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaAgainstMechagodzilla">Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla</a></em>, the English dub states that Mothra was killed during her first appearance on Japanese soil in 1961. Though this contradicts the events of the original film, this particular entry makes use of plenty of past Toho kaiju movies in its canon while altering small details, such as Godzilla's skeleton being left intact by the Oxygen Destroyer. However, Mothra makes an appearance in the next film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaTokyoSOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaTokyoSOS">Godzilla Tokyo SOS</a></em>, which is directly tied to the previous film in terms of continuity. Though it's never explicitly stated that this is the same Mothra that appeared in 1961, the dub has everyone talking as if it is, and no reference or explanation is made regarding the previous dub's unambiguous statement that that Mothra was killed. No such inconsistency exists in the Japanese version, suggesting that the Hong Kong company responsible for dubbing these films didn't especially care for either accurate translations (though this is hardly the most egregious example of that) or preserving continuity between films. A smaller issue is that while in the former film, Mechagodzilla is more of a nickname for the Godzilla's robotic arch-rival, while the name "Kiryu" ("metal dragon") is used for the vast majority of references to it. This is the case in both the Japanese and English versions of the film. However, in the dub of the latter film, the superweapon is only referred to as Mechagodzilla, or "Mecha G" for short. No explanation is ever given, nor is the name change ever acknowledge. Again, the Japanese dialogue contains no such contradictions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>:
<ul><li> According to the Hungarian dub of the first movie, Saruman apparently perfected fighting <em>against</em> the Uruk-Hai. The dub contained a handful of such bloopers (not all of which got corrected for the DVD), ditto for the second movie, but by the third, the translator finally got just about everything right.
</li><li> The Spanish (Spain) dub, at least for the first movie, has a couple of minor ones. For example, when Frodo says Strider would "look fairer and feel fouler" if he was an enemy, the translator seemed to understand "feel fooler". Or Isildur referring to the Ring as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho">precious to him</a>", echoing Gollum's "my precious"... which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyized</a>, losing that reference.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceOfSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceOfSpace">Prince of Space</a></em> wasn't immune to enemy weapon fire in the original Japanese, but picked this up sometime during the conversion to English. Neatly explains why he keeps dodging. And why Phantom of Krankor keeps ordering his men to shoot him anyway.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon">Transformers: Dark of the Moon</a></em>, a Decepticon attack separates Optimus Prime from his trailer/weapon cache/flight gear. He exasperatedly <em>demands</em> his flight tech back. In the Hungarian dub, however, he calls for a technician. Yet Que, the Autobot technician, is standing right there! And in the final scene of the movie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when he tries to offer an alliance,</span> Megatron calls Optimus Prime <em>Sentinel</em> Prime. This change of names isn't only erroneous, translating the dialog word-for-word would've been enough — since in the original, Megatron just says "Prime". The context made it clear which Prime he was referring to... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>not</em> the one he had just shot down, but the one he was <em>facing</em>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlueStreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlueStreak">Blue Streak</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYoureSoEvilEatThisKitten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYoureSoEvilEatThisKitten">If You're So Evil, Eat This Kitten</a> scene where Deacon asks Logan to shoot a guy, and Logan complies by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">shooting him in the shoulder</a>. Deacon then complains because Logan was supposed to kill him. The Polish dub makes the scene nonsensical because the word Deacon uses ("postrzel") specifically means "shoot non-lethally" (as opposed to "zastrzel" which always means "shoot to kill") so Deacon has no reason to complain when Logan didn't kill the guy.
</li><li> In the German dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</a></em>, the brief scene reveal with the fifth golden ticket being a fake was cut out, mainly due to the picture used of the Paraguay gambler was one of Martin Bormann, head of the Nazi Party Chancellory, and Adolf Hitler's private secretary (intending to be a riff on former Nazis fleeing to South America). Furthermore, Wonka's explanation towards the end was somewhat confusing, considering that he intended to send out the golden tickets only to children (as he explains that "a grown-up would want to do everything his own way"). Likewise, the former scene remains in English on the DVD release.
<ul><li> On a minor note, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame">most of the musical numbers also remain in English</a>, despite carrying the action.

They respond by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTuneCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTuneCameo">singing a slight variation of their theme song</a>, beginning <em>Wir sind Bibi und Tina...</em> (We are Bibi and Tina). However, the English version translated the theme song to "Here come Bibi and Tina...", making the response sound very strange.
</li><li> In the Russian dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em> in the scene when Rose explains business matters of Canto Bight to Finn, the latter guesses that its <em>"ore"</em> makes people this rich (instead of original <em>"war"</em>), making it look like an unexplained plot point. In the same dub Yodas lines: "We are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters" was translated as "We are <em>whom we</em> grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters", leaving the viewers to wonder about meaning and future ramifications of the Master's ever puzzling insights.</li></ul></div>

However, in the Latin American version, the phrase is translated as "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up <em>for</em> our friends", which is exactly the opposite of what Neville did, so Dumbledore giving him any points for it makes no sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></em>: When Hermione mentions that the 1792 Triwizard Tournament was cancelled because of a cockatrice breaking free and injuring the judges, the Dutch and Italian editions translate "cockatrice" as "basilisk". But this is impossible, since breeding basilisks has been illegal since medieval times. And they certainly don't want to use one of the most deadly creatures ever in a school tournament — its gaze alone would have killed the entire audience. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasiliskAndCockatrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasiliskAndCockatrice">The terms are generally considered synonymous in the real world</a>, so this was bound to come up in at least one translation.
</li><li> The Dutch translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle">The Death Gate Cycle</a></em> suffered from this. A few added sentences in the later books serve to explain that the characters have simply been using the wrong words. It doesn't help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfTruth">The Sword of Truth</a></em> was translated rather badly to Russian. Here are just the examples from the first book: 1) Kahlan scares away a girl by calmly stating she will "deal" with a certain man she's unaware is her friend. The original has her threatening to <em>skin</em> him. 2) Denna orders Richard to eat from a bowl without his hands because he's her "pet". Except in the translation, the word used means "disciple" or "trainee". 3) The translation claims that Darken Rahl can use the Magic of Orden to rule <em>forever</em>. There are several places where he states he needs Kahlan to have a <em>heir</em>. And then there is the matter of multiple uncoordinated translators...
</li><li> Early Spanish editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels used feminine pronouns for Death, since the corresponding word (La Muerte) is female. When <em>Reaper Man</em> came out and unambiguously identified Death as male, the translators had to do some backpedaling.
<ul><li> A mild example in the Swedish <em>Discworld</em> translation: one translator translates "the Dungeon Dimensions" as "the Demon Dimensions", presumably because Swedish doesn't have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">appropriate alliterative</a> word for "dungeon". While this certainly sounds funny, it obscures the point made in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eric" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eric">Eric</a></em> that the Dungeon Dimensions (home of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">amoral</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>) are distinct from Hell (home of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">demons</a> who take an active interest in doing evil).
</li></ul></li><li> The French translation of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiseOfTheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiseOfTheHorde">Rise of the Horde</a></em> combines this with Dub Induced Spoilers (even with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a>); it is hard to understand why the reveal that warlocks are working with demons is surprising anyone when "warlock" is translated as "demoniste."
</li><li> In the scene in the French <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomOfTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomOfTheOpera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></em> where Erik gives his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum">Scarpia Ultimatum</a> to Christine, he tells her to turn the scorpion figurine on the mantelpiece if she agrees to marry him or turn the grasshopper figurine if she refuses, which he claims will blow the Opera sky-high, killing everyone in it. While referring to the grasshopper, he makes a pun out of the French verb "sauter," which means both "to jump" and "to explode." As there's absolutely no word with the same meanings in English, most English translations end up making the wording awkward at best. One translator solved the problem by turning the grasshopper into a frog, which can "jump" and "croak", thus working in an English pun about dying.
</li><li> The Italian translation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot">Hercule Poirot</a> story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordEdgwareDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordEdgwareDies">Lord Edgware Dies</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> altered the plot point where the killer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tears an "s" off the corner of a letter to change "she" into "he"</span> because this would not work in Italian: instead, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the page is ripped so that only the final "i" from "lei" ("she") would be read, so it might as well be "lui" ("he").

</li><li> Too many to name in the infamous Swedish translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, due to the translator's insistence on adding in lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse">Purple Prose</a> (where Tolkien had been more straightforward) and his stubborn refusal to correct mistakes, even when Tolkien himself called him up and asked him to fix it. Probably the biggest change to the plot is the fact that due to the translation changing a "she" to "he", <em>Merry</em> deals the killing blow to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Witch-King of Angmar</span>, rather than Éowyn doing it as in the original. (Though this was fixed in later editions.)
</li><li> There's one multiple-books-spanning mistake in the Russian translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>. The character Sanya is a Russian of African lineage; when he is first introduced in <em>Death Masks</em>, he is described as a black man with a Russian accent. But black people are quite rare in Russia, so the translator decided that Sanya is just swarthy, and chose the appropriate word. Several books later, Sanya's skin color and its rarity in Russia becomes a plot point: as a child he often was gawked at, which made him rather unhappy. The translator decided not to correct the mistake: he invented a different origin for Sanya, making him of an unspecified swarthy Southern ethnicity, which, according to this version, invites much hostility in Russia.
</li><li> In the first volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife">No Game No Life</a></em>, Kurami, in an attempt to win a gambling tournament to become ruler of Elkia, enlists the help of an elf, who uses magic to help Kurami cheat, since none of the other participants can even detect it, much less do anything. In the English localization, the elf, who only appears briefly after being exposed, is referred to with male pronouns. The problem? The elf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">later turns out to be Feel</a>, a secondary character who happens to be <em>a woman</em>.
</li><li> The English localization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em> omits all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics">Japanese Honorifics</a>, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenpaiKohai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenpaiKohai">Senpai Kohai</a>, resulting in Haruyuki "Silver Crow" Arita simply calling Kuroyukihime by name rather than "Senpai." This later causes a problem when Wolfram Cerberus III calls Silver Crow "Arita-senpai," causing Haru to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingOnlyTheyWouldSay">recognize him</a> as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Seiji "Dusk Taker" Noumi, who'd been kicked off Brain Burst long ago</span>. The localization of the light novel just has Cerberus' third personality call Crow "Arita," something that a few other characters do (for example, Utai "Ardor Maiden" Shinomiya calls him "Arita-san" in the original and "Arita" in the localization).
</li><li> The Ivan Krylov's Russian adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrasshopperAndTheAnts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrasshopperAndTheAnts">The Grasshopper and the Ants</a></em>, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AesopsFables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AesopsFables">Aesop's Fables</a>, instead of a grasshopper or a cicada like in the French adaptation, the first title character is a dragonfly. While it may look elegant and frail on the surface, anyone who has any passing knowledge of entomology will be able to tell that the dragonfly, far from being a careless freeloader, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreadfulDragonfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreadfulDragonfly">a ferocious predator</a> that would give any ant a run for its money in terms of laser-sharp focus and ruthlessness. Even without any biology knowledge, there's still the more obvious issue that, unlike either grasshoppers or cicadas, both insects known for making plenty of noise, a dragonfly does not "sing".

Note that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">the original voices are often heard in Russian dubbing</a> — still, most of the readers wouldn't recognize a Mancunian accent. Technically, most of the Russian dubs, even those with full voice replacement, usually keep the references to the original language and its quirks — under the assumption that the viewers would normally know what the original language of the show is (via the show's title screen, for instance). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">That the viewers might not know about said quirks, on the other hand...</a> Also, Russian dubs don't usually bother with accents and everybody speaks the same way.
</li><li> The French dub of the show had similar occurrences of the accent being brought up, despite not being really distinguished in any way by the way the characters were dubbed. Amy Pond has the same name in the French translation, but "pond" in French has no meaning relating to a body of water<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note991li');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note991li" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note991li');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">it could mean the verb for laying an egg, with different tenses depending on whether you consider the written or spoken version</span>, thus losing all the connections made between Amy's last name and ponds. They are usually explained by mentioning what "pond" means in English, but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2012CSTheSnowmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2012CSTheSnowmen">The Snowmen</a>, the one word Clara says to convince the Doctor to help is "pond", like in English, without any explanation as to how she came to choose this particular word.
</li><li> The Czech dub of "Asylum of the Daleks" was criticized by fans for translating the "eggs-exterminate" pun of the episode in such a lazy way that it altered all the later soufflé-related references of Series 7. In the dub, Oswin is apparently working on "baked icecream" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">which is a real thing, BTW</a>) instead of soufflés — despite the fact that what she's trying to bake looks very obviously like a soufflé. This whole bizarre and unnecessary change in that one bit of the translation was made so that the translator-chosen pun could work in the episode. While the pun arguably works, the ham-fisted way it's incorporated into the episode and how it messes up all later Series 7 soufflé references and the continuity tied to them, is really ridiculous. And, to add insult to injury, Oswin isn't even nicknamed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname">Soufflé Girl</a> at any point in the episode, because it wouldn't make sense anymore. The consensus among the Czech fans is that the pun could have certainly been translated a little differently, without omitting any and all references to soufflés.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alf">ALF</a></em>, Alf jokes about making a BLT, a bacon, Lucky and Tomato sandwhich. The joke get translated identically in Latin America (where Lucky is called "Suertudo", which obviously doesn't begin with an L), thus ruining the joke.
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto">Kamen Rider Kabuto</a></em> has a scene where a pickpocket, being chased by Kagami, slashes at Tendou's throat with a knife but just barely misses despite Tendou not reacting at all. The Philippine dub cuts out the attack but leaves everything else intact, so Kagami saying "What's wrong with you?! You almost got killed!" to Tendou seems to come from nowhere.
</li><li> The syndicated version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> will occasionally shave of a piece of the episode for whatever reason. This ranges from the removal of a single line "SUCK IT, BITCH!!" to the removal of <em>an entire climax</em>. So sometimes, His Story will end with Dr. Cox growing closer to J.D. for literally no reason.
<ul><li> The German dub of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> episode "My Interpretation" replaces the German patient that JD treats with a Danish patient who only speaks Danish. Despite this, they keep the sequence in which J.D. dances to <em>99 Luftballons</em> in order to bond with the patient, but since he is no longer German, the sequence no longer makes sense.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens">The King of Queens</a></em>, Carrie tries to get rid of her accent, in order to get a promotion. Viewers of the German dub are now tempted to ask "What accent?", because she speaks perfect Standard German (like most people in German dubs do). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyTranslation">Luckily, the episode is salvaged a bit</a> by the fact that <em>talk</em> (the word treated as representative for Carrie's pronunciation problems) is contained in the German <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">anglicism</a> <em>Small Talk</em>, giving somewhat the impression that Carrie's main problem is specifically the pronunciation of such anglicisms. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10s974');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10s974" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10s974');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They even managed to put in a small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyism</a>: In one scene, Spencer's instructions cause a confused Carrie to pronounce <em>talk</em> like <em>tag</em>. In the dubbed version, Carrie pronounces it like the similarly spelled German word <em>Talk</em> ( = <em>talc</em>).</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> episode "Phases" Oz discovers he has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">werewolf</a>. He has a talk with Giles who explains the precautions he can take to prevent him from posing a danger to others; Giles' explanation apparently involved a globe. In <a class="urllink" href="http://www.buffymaniac.it/adattamento/2_15_phases.php">the Italian dub<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Oz instead says Giles used a volcano. What does a volcano have to do with a werewolf...?
<ul><li> The Italian adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> is notoriously bad. In the episode "Smashed" the conversation between Spike and Buffy about his being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">able to hurt her despite his chip</a> was completely twisted: "Came back a little less human than you were." was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.buffymaniac.it/adattamento/6_09_smashed.php">translated as<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "You came back a little more human than you were.", making the entire plot point completely nonsensical.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Mexican dub for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em>, Ms. Fine doesn't have a raspy annoying voice with a thick New York accent, but a rather normal one with a slight sexy tinge and a neutral accent. This makes all the jokes and references about Ms. Fine's speech confusing.
</li><li> Countries that started airing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> dubbed from the very start before 2016 with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hodor's nickname</span> intact are gonna have a hard time figuring out how to work <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Hodor" to whatever "hold the door" means in their respective language</span>. This is because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> in Season 6 (aired in the aforementioned year) that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the nickname originated from an accidental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalTimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalTimeTravel">Mental Time Travel</a> where Wylis (the character's real name) is specifically told <em>in English</em> to "hold the door". The command keeps repeating on his head which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra">he himself eventually does</a> until it condensed, which ultimately became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">the only thing he can say</a></span>. This will likely necessitate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a> for countries that are yet to air the series. David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have even apologized for it.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a> </em>had a lot of issues caused by card archetypes introduced in Japan. Cards with "Demon" in their name were translated as various different things across early sets, probably for censorship reasons. (So we got things like "Summoned Skull" and "Axe of Despair" instead of "Summoned Demon" and "Demon's Axe") This wasn't a problem originally... until a later expansion introduced cards that specifically affected monsters with "Demon" in their names. The English cards had to retroactively introduce a category called "Archfiend", which included everything that was a Demon in Japanese. The reverse also happened occasionally: "Harpy's Brother" was called "Bird-Man" in Japanese and so was not a "Harpy" card. Later cards with effects specifically targeting Harpies had to add text in the English version saying "Harpy's Brother" was an exception, and eventually the card was renamed "Sky Scout" to avoid confusion. The silliest example is probably "Arsenal Summoner", which reads like this in English:
<div class="indent">Add 1 "Guardian" card from your Deck to your hand, except "Celtic Guardian", "Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1", "Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #2", "Guardian of the Labyrinth", or "The Reliable Guardian". <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4bcyv');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4bcyv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4bcyv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Take a guess as to which monsters did not have "Guardian" in their Japanese names.</span>
</div><ul><li> One series of monsters was the Inverz. For whatever reason, their name was changed in the English game to "Steelswarm." Not an out-there name, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">giant demon bugs.</a> Problem was, a following series were the next step up on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a>, the Verz. Due to that wording, it meant that cards that supported "Verz" cards also supported "Inverz", for obvious reasons, making "Inverz" sort of a retroactive subcategory. To reflect this, the English game had to change their name to the clunky-sounding "Evilswarm", and their support to the even clunkier "lswarm".
</li><li> A lot of puns wind up getting missed by the translators. Probably the biggest one is Number 39 - King of Wishes, Hope, which had its name changed to Number 39 - Utopia. This turned the names of a lot of its upgraded forms (Hope Ray, Hope Ray Victory, Hope Roots, Future Hope, Beyond Hope) into non sequiturs.
</li><li> A case arising from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization">Bowdlerization</a>: originally, Revolver Dragon was essentially a robot dragon made of three giant revolvers that attacked by "spinning" its half-loaded cylinders and then firing, a la <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette">Russian Roulette</a> (meaning it also had a chance to not attack). With that in mind, its in-game effect was based on tossing coins—because like a half-loaded revolver, sometimes the coins could go tails and the effect would fail to go off. This was heavily censored, with the art being edited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms">turn the revolvers into laser cannons</a> and the monster being renamed Barrel Dragon. However, they didn't change the effect at all, raising the question of why this dragon has a gamble effect at all. (If nothing else, it proved oddly prescient, as Barrel Dragon saw a lot of successor cards that were based on different guns but still had gamble effects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">Reliably Unreliable Guns</a>, maybe?)
</li><li> A long-running case of this is Skull Servant. It was originally called "Wight", but it was a completely innocuous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMon">Com Mon</a> so nobody really noticed. Then it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser">Memetic Loser</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>, and so it got a support card named Wight King, which the English game renamed "King of the Skull Servants." Still pretty reasonable. But this spawned a whole wave of cards that all punned off "Wight", like Lady in Wight or Tri-Wight or Wightmare. The translators wisely avoided naming these cards things "Skull Servantmare" and just left their names as-is, leading to a weird case where the two focal cards of the archetype are the only ones exempt from its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> The decision of early translators to change Sonic's home world from Earth (granted, the Japanese word for Earth can also mean "the land", suggesting that Sonic's world is actually unnamed) to Mobius (which is presumed to have been a translator error from an interview with Yuji Naka) probably didn't seem like much of a stretch at the time.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11j8ss');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11j8ss" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11j8ss');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As many of the levels in the early games looked more surreal than anything you'd find on Earth anyway.</span> Years later, after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> started forcing the Japanese continuity on the rest of the world, the series began mentioning Earth by name, humans other than Robotnik/Eggman appeared, and locations took on more realistic elements. Of course, this led to confusion for the many Western fans who grew up with the numerous comic books and TV adaptations which placed Sonic on a planet called Mobius.
</li><li> Dr. Robotnik's English name was always somewhat at odds with the fact that so many of his evil inventions involved the word "Egg." At the time of <em>Sonic Adventure</em> Sega of America began slowly phasing in his Japanese name, "Dr. Eggman." Extra lines were added in <em>Adventure</em> to explain that "Eggman" was a nickname used by Sonic and co. to make fun of him, while Dr. Robotnik remained his "real" name. By the sequel, suddenly Eggman's calling himself "Eggman" as well and his surname is rarely brought up.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">explanation</a> that Eggman was an insult used by Sonic and hated by Robotnik <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">is in itself an example of this</a>, as it brings the question of why Robotnik started calling himself that in later games, or why it's the password to one of the doors in the Egg Carrier in the game itself.
</li><li> The "Eggman" name even shows up in the classic games - in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em>, "EGGMAN-01" can be seen written on the Wing Fortress.
</li><li> It's an explanation from the Archie's comic, but it can also be applied to the games. When recovering from insanity, Robotnik mentions that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppropriatedAppellation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppropriatedAppellation">he was called Eggman as a tease but he took that name and gave it power</a>, forming the Eggman Empire. This could be referencing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> where he blows up half the moon. Suddenly "Eggman" doesn't seem like much of a joke anymore, hm?
</li></ul></li><li> The American <em>Sonic</em> comic tried to reconcile this by revealing that Mobius <em>was</em> Earth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">in the future</a> (they continued to call it "Mobius" after this revelation, though, regardless of the games explicitly using "Earth").
</li><li> Sega of America also briefly attempted to merge Amy Rose in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic CD</a></em> with Princess Sally from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em> animated series by referring to Amy as "Princess Sally" in the American <em>Sonic CD</em> booklet. Did they <em>really</em> think people were stupid enough to think a squirrel and a hedgehog were the same character just because they were both pink and shared a name? Even before then, Sally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">wasn't pink in the cartoon aside from its pilot, and she stopped being pink in the comics the next year</a>. Needless to say, this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">disconfirmed into infinity</a> long before <em>Sonic Adventure</em> premiered in the States. In particular, this got Jossed within two years. In the comics, Amy made her first appearance in Issue #25 (which dropped in 1995); and she was referred to by her proper name in the <em>Sonic Drift 2</em> game (also 1995).
<ul><li> The 1996 PC version's manual attempted to correct this by replacing all mentions of Sally with Amy, but it still failed to avoid being this trope. The revised storyline portrayed Sonic and Amy as being friendly toward each other, arriving at Neverlake together, and Amy getting kidnapped right there. This is at odds with what's shown in the game: Sonic arrives at Neverlake alone (as depicted in the opening FMV), Amy doesn't get kidnapped until the beginning of Collision Chaos, and the ending FMV shows that Sonic doesn't enjoy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Amy's</a> company.

The English story removed the references, renamed Newtrogic High Zone into Carnival Island (despite the former name appearing in-game in level title cards and the hub area), bafflingly changed Knuckles into the guardian of Carnival Island and its park (thus contradicting established canon and even <em>the game itself</em>, creating plot holes such as to why is it that the park has Eggman's face plastered everywhere (most notably the entrance) or why it has areas specifically designed for his boss battle mechs), removed the references to the Chaos Rings (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">thus leaving them unexplained and unmentioned</a> despite being major items obtainable in the game that are required for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodEnding">Good Ending</a>), and in their place added a mention of a "Power Emerald" that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">never appears in the game or is mentioned again.</a>

His actual species seems to have gone over the localization team's heads as a result of it not being mentioned in the title attached to his Japanese name, unlike most <em>Sonic</em> characters. The inaccuracy in his dub name is possibly the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenNameChange">it was scrapped</a> right after his debut game, with the other games to feature him, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicDrift">Sonic Drift 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheFighters">Sonic the Fighters</a></em>, keeping his Japanese name overseas (despite the latter changing "Eggman" to "Robotnik").
</li><li> A minor one, but after the intro to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces">Sonic Forces</a></em>, it's said that Sonic was subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> for six months aboard the Death Egg. Yet when we next see him, he looks no worse for wear, as cheerful and snarky as ever without a scratch on him. That's because this particular line was only added for the English dub. The Japanese version mentions no such thing.
<ul><li> Similarly, in an early scene in the English dub, Silver mentions that Tails "has just lost it", implying that Sonic's absence drove Tails insane. Yet when we see Tails shortly after this, he seems perfectly fine and sane. In the original Japanese script, Silver said that Tails had gone missing, i.e. was "lost". The translators simply misinterpreted the sentence.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> has the infamous quote "You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance!" With that, gamers everywhere scrambled to find out just <em>who</em> this elusive "Sheng Long" was, which in part inspired <em>Electronic Gaming Monthly</em> to print an April Fool's joke that may have inspired the character of Akuma. The truth is, Ryu was referring to his Rising Dragon Punch: the Mandarin pronunciation of the <em>Shoryū</em> in <em>Shoryūken</em> is "Sheng Long", and the translators at Capcom used the Pinyin transliteration of the characters instead of the Japanese ones for some reason. The curious part about the "Sheng Long" quote was that the actual Japanese version of <em>The World Warrior</em> has all of the victory quotes written in kana (kanji was not added to the game's text until <em>Champion Edition</em>), so <em>Shoryūken</em> is written the same way it is pronounced in Japanese.
<ul><li> In <em>Super Street Fighter II</em>, Cammy's ending in the Japanese version originally revealed that she was an agent of Shadaloo before she lost her memories and joined Delta Red. In the English version, this was changed into M. Bison revealing that Cammy was his lover. This brings up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself">strange implication</a> when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a></em> revealed that Cammy was actually a DNA copy (read: clone) of Bison himself, although the GBA port of <em>Super Turbo</em> later featured a revised ending that reflected Cammy's retconned origins.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BreathOfFireII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BreathOfFireII">Breath of Fire II</a></em> has an island filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">giant monsters</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">two cameo characters from the first game</a>. One mentions that he has found a weird stone and that when he holds it, he can see his bones through the skin. One of the monsters is called the A. Sludge. If you played the Japanese version, you find out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower">the A. in his name stands for Atomic!</a> While the translation is technically correct, it doesn't explain much of why there are giant monsters on the island.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the English version, Judith says during one scene "I plead the fifth," a saying referring to the Fifth Amendment of the American constitution's right to remain silent, despite the game not even remotely occurring in America.
</li><li> In the Italian translation, Flynn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">calls Estelle a princess right after rescuing Ioder, with no one reacting since it's not supposed to happen yet</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</a></em>, shortened to just <em>Fire Emblem</em> during its release, is a prequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade">another</a></em> game that didn't come out in English. In particular, the game ends on what would appear to be an unexplained cliffhanger that was in fact a setup for the plot of the game that came before it.
<ul><li> In the Japanese version, the Tactician's affinity is determined by bloodtype and birth month while the English merely uses month. This leaves the fact that there are units who are twins with differing affinity bizarre.
</li><li> The English translation changed Lyn's age from 15 to 18, probably to reduce the odd implications of her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> character. Which is fair... but they didn't change a line in one support suggesting her parents eloped sixteen years ago.
</li></ul></li><li> A somewhat complicated one. In the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">there are two kinds of "dragon"</a> - the magical, intelligent, shapeshifting variety, called a manakete, and an unintelligent and unpowered variety that sees use mostly as a mount, called a <em>hiryu</em> ("wind dragon"). The English translation decided to go with "wyvern" for the latter variety to differentiate them: though they have four legs and therefore don't match traditional wyvern designs, the name has similar connotations of a dimwitted horse-sized dragon in Western fantasy, so it seemingly worked out. Then in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em>, they introduced the "Wyvern Knight" class, which rides a dragon that actually <em>is</em> a traditional wyvern, with two legs and two wings, and it's called "<em>waiban</em>" (an obvious transliteration of the English word). In Japanese, this makes sense; the wyvern and the <em>hiryu</em> look different and are named different things. In English, you wonder why they're both called wyverns when they're clearly not the same species.
</li><li> The translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em> adds a line to Ike and Soren's A support that states that Greil helped Soren along with Ike, which not only makes Soren's loyalty to Ike specifically rather than Greil more confusing, but is also explicitly contradicted in a more detailed recounting of the event in question in <em>Radiant Dawn</em>.
</li><li> In an unintentional swap of keywords, Rolf tells Tauroneo in their C support that his mom died and dad left his family. While this is already confusing because Boyd mentions his dad dying earlier (in an early info conversation), it's made clear in <em>Radiant Dawn</em> that Rolf's mom is alive and was the one who left the family while their dad was dying. In the original Japanese, Rolf's retelling of the events match up with the rest of the games.
</li><li> One of Janaff's alternate death quotes is "Ike, please look after my son!" Janaff doesn't have a son, he was actually saying "look after <em>the prince</em> " (i.e. Reyson).
</li><li> One that's become consistent throughout the series: Reyson in <em>Path of Radiance</em> has an ability simply called "Re-Move" in the Japanese version, which does exactly what it sounds like, allowing a character to keep moving after they've already done something. The English version changed this to "Canto", because Reyson is a singer, and a canto is a term for a sung section of a long poem. Makes sense, and it's a better name. Thing is, "Re-Move" had appeared in games prior to the translation, where it was a generic skill shared by all mounted and flying units. Later games reverted it to this status but kept the name Canto, despite it now being completely incongruous. (They could have changed it to something like "Vigor" or "Withdraw", but at this point the name has stuck.)
</li><li> By a similar count, changing the name of the spell "Resile" to "Nosferatu" made a lot of sense when the first translated game had it be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">a dark magic spell</a>. A dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life Drain</a> spell named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu">a famous vampire</a>? Makes a lot of sense, compared to a rather oblique reference to an obscure word meaning "to recoil." But in several prior games, Resile had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">a light magic spell</a>, and later games tend to alternate between it being light or dark. In the games where it's a light spell, this mostly leaves people very confused as to why you would name a light spell, and one generally used by good-guy clerics, at that, after a vampire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em> has two examples involving gameplay changes in localization leading to story problems.
<ul><li> The first: if you promote Lucia to Trueblade during Part 2, her battle model will reflect the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut">Traumatic Haircut</a> she gets at the end of the part, before it's happened. This wasn't a problem in the Japanese version, because it <em>wasn't possible</em> to promote her to Trueblade until after Part 2. (There, you needed a Master Crown to promote to a 3rd tier class, and you didn't get any until Part 3.)
</li><li> The second deals with the "More Merchants" base conversation early in the game. They mention needing to sell weapons for scrap metal in order to make custom forged weapons, but wave this requirement for your first forged weapon, as a special offer. The English version removed the scrap metal system entirely, so this "special first-time offer" is useless... but the conversation still has an importance rating of 3 stars (which indicates getting an actual gameplay reward out of it). Furthermore, not needing to pay scrap metal for your first forge was mistranslated as getting your first forged weapon free of charge, which isn't true.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> has one right at the beginning. The Avatar, suffering from amnesia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverToldYouMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverToldYouMyName">knows Chrom's name without being told it</a>, which Frederick finds very suspicious. However, in the English dub, Lissa calls Chrom by name before the Avatar does, providing a reasonable explanation as to how the Avatar would know it. The scene plays out the same anyway, with the Avatar saying his name "just came to [them]" and Frederick accusing them of lying. Of course, it could be that Frederick didn't realize the Avatar was conscious enough to hear her.
<ul><li> Henry's conversation with Inigo if he's his father in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">The Future Past DLC</a> has a line where Henry says "It wasn't until I met your mother that I figured out what a real smile was." This is a reference to his supports with Olivia... at least in the Japanese version. The English version heavily re-wrote Henry and Olivia's supports to remove any mention of "real smiles", so the above line no longer makes sense. (Or at least, isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> anymore) Since the DLC came out after the main game, the English localizers must have forgotten they changed that support when they translated the father-son DLC dialogue.
</li></ul></li><li> A rather nasty one occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, when Ryoma insults The Avatar should they side with Nohr, he says that they shouldn't value the siblings because they aren't blood related, a stark contrast to his understanding portrayal in the original Japanese. While in line with the altered portrayal of the Hoshidans in the localization as being rather racist, it creates a huge plot hole when it's revealed later that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Avatar isn't the blood relative of the Hoshido kids, just Queen Mikoto, which Ryoma reveals in his supports that he knew from the beginning</span>. Consequently, the altered line makes Ryoma look like an uncharacteristically huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrite</a>.
<ul><li> In the Hidden Truths DLC, the first map features Odin, Laslow and Selena in their past identities, before they went by these false names. But since they still keep their voice clips from Fates, Owain can still say "Odin Dark knows no fear" in battle. None of his Japanese quotes referred to him by that name, so there wasn't an issue there.

This doesn't explain why your character appears in prison clothes complete with ball and chain on the game over screen.
</li><li> The English localization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoJosBizarreAdventureAllStarBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoJosBizarreAdventureAllStarBattle">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle</a></em> has an unfortunate Sub-Induced Plothole with Joseph Joestar's counter-taunt, based on his famous ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyThatsMyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyThatsMyLine">tell a person what they're going to say before they say it</a>. When used against Ermes Costello, he tells her she'll say "Your foe is right here!" While the actual spoken line is the same thing Joseph says, Ermes' line is translated in the subtitles as "Come at me, bro!" Regardless of actually getting the line wrong, Ermes' super meter still takes a hit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar">Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WorkingDesigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WorkingDesigns">Working Designs</a> mistranslated "Mel governs Meribia" as "Mel founded Meribia." Thankfully, this was corrected in <em>Silver Star Harmony</em>.
<ul><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue">Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete</a></em>, one of Ronfar's battle quotes is "Thank God for miracles!" in a world that has a Goddess (Althena), not a God.
</li><li> <em>Eternal Blue</em> also says that Mel founded Meribia and even "named it after himself," which would somewhat make sense in the Japanese version, where Mel's name is "Meru," although it somewhat seems out of place in English.
</li></ul></li><li> The American localizations of the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a></em> games claimed that those games were set in the present, while the Japanese versions actually took place in the 27th century. This was mostly done since the games themselves didn't look very futuristic, taking place mostly in jungle environments and generic military bases. This didn't prove problematic until <em>Contra III: The Alien Wars</em>, which had a futuristic city as its first stage. To work around this plot hole, Konami simply claimed that the main characters in <em>Contra III</em> were not Bill and Lance, but their descendants Jimbo and Sully, and then scrubbed off the time stamps on the photographs shown in the ending sequence depicting Bill and Lance's previous missions.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1">Persona</a></em> hits just about every <em>other</em> bad translation trope there is, so it's not surprising it gets this one, too. In the Japanese version, the two young girls in the other world are Mai and Aki... so it's not very surprising that they turn out to be aspects of the mind of party member Maki — as Nanjo points out, it's simple wordplay. In the English-language version, they're now Mae and Maggie, and Maki is Mary — so not only does this previously fairly well-foreshadowed twist suddenly come out of nowhere, but Nate (Nanjo) <strong>still</strong> gives the explanation that it's simple wordplay even though this no longer makes sense, making him look less "smart and observant" like he's supposed to, and more like a raving lunatic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForceII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForceII">Shining Force II</a></em> has a scene in which a plot-central prophecy is mistranslated, causing two characters to be referred to with the wrong names. To make things worse, they are referred to with names that already belong to entirely different characters. This causes the prophecy to make no sense in relation to the other games in the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend of Zelda I</a></em> game, the manual includes the hint that the Pols Voice enemy "hates loud noises". At no point in the localized version of the game does this come into play. It's referencing a trick on the Japanese (Famicom Disk System) version, in which Pols Voices could be killed by shouting into the microphone built into the controller. However, when the Famicom was released in the West as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, it didn't have the microphone, but the description in the manual was unchanged. American gamers wasted a <em>lot</em> of time trying to kill them by playing the recorder, not helped by the presence of a boss who <em>is</em> injured by the recorder.
</li><li> The English translation of the manual of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">A Link to the Past</a></em> states that the Master Sword was forged specifically to stop Ganon, whereas the original Japanese stated that the people began <em>searching</em> for the Master Sword when Ganon rose. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em> would later contradict the English version by showing the Master Sword's origins well before Ganon(dorf) even existed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Beast Ganon</span> is said to be the result of Calamity Ganon giving up on reincarnation in a last ditch attempt to destroy Link. The problem is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> implies Ganon could return at some point. The original Japanese script has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dark Beast Ganon</span> form because he <em>refuses</em> to give up on reincarnating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> has the fact that Marina is an Octoling. While blatantly obvious to the player, most of the characters aren't aware of this fact due to most Inklings not having contact with their sister species for several decades. The North American localization team didn't get the memo that Marina's best friend Pearl was part of that "most", leading to her regularly making octopus-related jokes during the news broadcasts the duo hosts. When it came time for the <em>Octo Expansion</em> DLC campaign, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReveal">Internal Reveal</a> finally happened, the localization team attempted to cover their tracks by having Pearl state that said jokes were the result of her always being suspicious of Marina being "different" but not wanting to directly confront her about it, and focused most of her surprise on her friend being ex-military.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></em> had a pretty infamous one. There's an NPC on Cinnabar Island who offers to trade you his Electrode for a Raichu; if you speak to him afterwards he claims "the Raichu you traded me went and evolved!", which of course, isn't possible. This led to <em>years</em> of wild fan speculation, with many interpreting this line as either "proof" of the existence of the so-called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">"PokéGods"</a>, or as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> of a new Mon to be revealed in an upcoming game. Turns out it was just a translation error  in the Japanese <em>Blue Version</em>, which provides the script and engine for the international releases rather than having them directly based on the original <em>Red</em> and <em>Green</em> (<em>Blue</em> was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> with bug fixes and generally better graphics, hence using its code), the NPC traded you a Graveler for a Kadabra, both Pokémon that evolve by trading, and his line afterwards was meant to be a hint on how to obtain their final forms. For the English release the localizers changed the Pokémon being offered to what they were in the Japanese <em>Red</em> and <em>Green</em> but simply forgot to alter the dialogue to match.
</li><li> A slightly lesser example is the move Heat Wave, a Fire move widely available by way of move tutors to Flying Pokémon. Its English description implies it's just another fire-breathing move, whereas the Japanese version (Hot Wind) came from the Pokemon's wings instead, which explains why it can be learned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMouth">Sigilyph</a>.
</li><li> Tail Whip. The name suggests that the user would smack the enemy with their tail to lower their Defense, but it is actually far less hardcore then that. Its original name is actually "Tail Wag", which is apparently used cutely to lower the enemy's guard. It is even considered a "Cute" move in Pokémon Contests. Later games would support the original depiction more in its description and animation.
</li><li> The deliberately useless move included in Gen I could be translated as either Splash or Hop. Given that, at the time, it was only learnable by the Water-type Magikarp, they decided to go with the former. But starting with Gen II, Pokémon like Hoppip and Buneary have been able to learn it. These Pokémon are associated in no way with water, but clearly associated with hopping. The fact that it's not a Water-type move should have clued them in from the start - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMagikarpJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMagikarpJump">Pokémon: Magikarp Jump</a></em>, a spinoff based on Magikarp jumping contests, which shows Magikarp Jumping very prominently, doesn't even bother trying to localise Jump Power to Splash Power, or the Jump button to Splash. Strangely, however, the animation for the move <em>does</em> show splashing water underneath the user in the main-line games of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">fourth</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">fifth</a> generations.
</li><li> The Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald</a></em> introduced a move called Firefly Light exclusive to the bug-type Pokémon Volbeat, which makes sense. The English translation team called it Tail Glow, making Western fans wonder why Ampharos (an electric Pokémon with a glowing sphere in its tail) or Charizard (a fire type with a flame on its tail) can't learn it. And then in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</a></em> the legendary Pokémon Manaphy was able to learn it, which makes some sense because it's based on deep-sea animals which typically have bioluminescence as fireflies do, but Western fans were even more puzzled because Manaphy has no tail whatsoever. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> would later introduce Xurkitree, a 12 foot tall mass of cables that resembles a humanoid figure or tree with glowing zip-ties on its person and an electric plug for a tail. It also learns Tail Glow, making this an inversion where the English translation would make a better fit then the Japanese name.
</li><li> At least one Pokemon's name ran into trouble too with the dub into English: Mr. Mime. It wasn't a problem in Gen I, since Pokémon didn't have gender aside from the Nidoran line. But, when gender and breeding were introduced in Gen II, it became possible to have a female Mr. Mime. If it had just been made a single-gender species like Jynx, Tauros, etc. it might have worked. Many already saw it as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart">Spear Counterpart</a> to Jynx. But, they didn't, since its Japanese name, "Barrierd" is gender-neutral. Same thing happened to Geodude, which are split evenly between genders despite the name.
<ul><li> Mr. Mime gave us another awkward situation with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>, where we are introduced to a Galarian subspecies that developed around tapdancing instead of miming. So now we've got "Mr. Mimes" that can't mime.
</li></ul></li><li> The animation for Submission implies that the move involves spinning in some way. That's because its Japanese name is based upon the pro wrestling move called the "Hell Wheel" (and is portrayed exactly like said wrestling move in the anime).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> introduces the move <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpromptuTracheotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpromptuTracheotomy">Throat Chop</a>. The translation decision wasn't a problem in its debut since Incineroar and the Sneasel line were the only ones who can get it (the latter by breeding) and they mainly use their arms to attack. It also made a lot of sense, since the move's description does mention it's an attack aimed at the neck and meant to damage the target's throat, making them unable to even speak for a bit—which is what a throat chop is. Then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em> made it a tutorable move, and the list of Pokémon who can learn it includes armless Pokémon such as Arbok, Seaking and Corsola. As it turns out, the Japanese name of Throat Chop is actually "Hell Thrust", its animation also reflects this by showing a single penetrating action instead of some slashing motion, and none of its attack descriptions mentions anything about chopping.
</li><li> The Iron Fist ability raises the power of punching moves, nearly all of which have the word "Punch" in their names. The move known in Japanese as "Surprise Attack" was translated as "Sucker Punch", leaving several players confused as to why it wasn't powered up by the ability. (Sucker Punch <em>is</em> a term for a cheap, unexpected attack, though the name led to a lot of players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor">taking it literally</a>) Conversely, "Meteor Mash" <em>is</em> boosted by Iron First, because it's called "Comet Punch" in Japan. (Like Mr. Mime, this was the case of an early translation coming back to bite them: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">the translators had already called another move "Comet Punch" in Generation 1 so had to change this one</a>)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>, harsh sunlight can occur in the Wild Area, even at night. The Japanese name of the move Sunny Day is "Clear Skies", so there it doesn't seem strange for that weather condition to naturally occur outside of daytime.
</li><li> Darmanitan has an ability called Zen Mode, which turns it into a stoic, statue-like daruma with psychic powers at half HP which contrasts with its regular beast form's aggressive temperament. At first, this sounds appropriate, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em> gave it a new Yeti-inspired form which turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> flaming snowman instead, which is the opposite of Zen. This confusion arose because in the original Japanese version, the ability was called Daruma Mode, which simply described its form and did not reference its emotional state. It also still fits the new form because Galar Darmanitan turns into a yukidaruma (Japanese for snowman), though that would have also been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">Lost in Translation</a> if they kept Daruma Mode as is.
</li><li> Like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> mentioned above, the game translation's renaming of Hyper Balls into Ultra Balls came back to bite them when the consoles became powerful enough to show the balls as more than a simple two-toned circle or a generic Pokeball... and they turned out to have "H" blatantly stamped on them. And then things got even more awkward with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>'s introduction of <em>actual</em> Ultra Balls, who had to be renamed into Beast Balls.

Except not really, as mentioned under Anime above, Wobuffet's Japanese name means "that's the way it is", so it's not really saying its name, it's agreeing with what other speakers are saying. The <em>Explorers</em> game caught on and had Wobuffet say "That's right!", but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst">Who's on First?</a> pun on its name is lost.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonExplorers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonExplorers">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers</a></em> games, Dialga's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> was just called "Dark Dialga" in Japan. The localization Woolseyised this to the more intimidating-sounding "Primal Dialga"... but then the remakes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em> would later give Groudon and Kyogre new stronger forms called... "Primal" forms, which led many fans to think Primal Dialga was connected to them. It isn't, they're entirely separate things.

The Japanese script didn't use a pronoun. The original English script used the pronoun 'she' - even if Shadow is the one you find, spawning a lot of conspiracy theories about Shadow being a woman.

In the former version, he says "The Empire's made me a rich man." whereas in the latter he says "The Empire's been bad for business."

In the original Japanese, she squeals when she realises it means Cloud and Barret could look up her skirt, and then calls them perverts, and Cloud and Barret respond with confusion.

It might have been a slight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerisation">Bowdlerisation</a>, or a poor attempt at fixing a scene that admittedly turned Tifa <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">out-of-character</a> for the sake of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">stock anime gag</a>.

In the original Japanese, he was a friend (possibly ex-boyfriend) of Tifa who grew up in the slums and who's jealous of Cloud for upstaging him. In English, he ends up a childhood friend of Tifa and (genuine) ex-SOLDIER who knew Cloud from his time in the unit, a position that throws up huge plot holes and makes no sense at all.
</li><li> The English translation accidentally kills off Tseng when Elena attempts to get revenge on Cloud for 'doing my boss in like that'. In the Japanese, she'd accused Cloud of merely beating him up. Since Tseng was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenInertia">last seen unconscious and slumped in a building the main characters end up shrinking to pocket-size</a>, and never appears in the game from that point onwards, it seemed logical he was dead, so many fans were surprised when Tseng appeared in the <em>Compilation</em> still alive and with no acknowledgement that this was unusual (unlike with Rufus, whose "death" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a>). This mistake, like many others, was corrected in script for the PC version of the game in which Elena states "You really got guts messin' my boss up like that!" However, the initial PC version was much less played than the PlayStation version, especially in its initial release.
</li><li> The scene at the end where Cloud tells everyone "alright, everyone, let's mosey" isn't, as is commonly claimed, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">"Blind Idiot" Translation</a> - it's a solid attempt at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">Cultural Translation</a> of a scene where Cloud uses a weak Japanese verb to indicate that they should go and Cid gets him to change it to a stronger one. The problem comes in with the fact that the translator missed the fact that the scene was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairSpeech">Despair Speech</a> Cloud gives after Aeris's death, in which, after explaining that everything was hopeless and he shouldn't carry on, he says "let's go" in the same weak way. The translator mistook the scene for a comedy scene rather than a dramatic moment and localised it accordingly. This has the result of making Cid react like he's listening to Cloud say something he heard Cloud say before when Cloud only says 'let's mosey' once.

Localization teams, however, chose to use male pronouns. Several years then passed before Nael finally appeared without a mask in the game's patch 2.2, revealing herself as a woman. This was first hastily explained by Nael having originally been male until "his" body was rebuilt by Bahamut into a female one for unspecified reasons. Two years later, Nael's story was retconned again into its current form: the real Nael died long ago, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">his sister Eula had been posing as him ever since</a>.

In reality, Kuribo is just "Goomba" and Jugem is "Lakitu" in Japanese  the item names were never properly translated.

The English translation of the game didn't make any distinction between the two and simply calls them "Goombas". Since regulars Goombas don't appear in <em>Super Mario World</em>, this didn't create an issue at first; years down the line, though, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em> featured <em>both</em> regular Goombas and "Kuribon" Goombas, sometimes even in the same levels.

For example Gustafa mentions that a man (the original Gustafa) once owned his hut a long time ago.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare">WarioWare</a></em> series, Ashley has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">vague, implicitly young age</a>, but tends to be explicitly referred to as 15 in international promotional materials, possibly because the localization team felt it was strange for a preteen girl to be living on her own. Ordinarily this doesn't create problems, but in Ashley's eponymous minigame in <em>Game &amp; Wario</em>, the player needs to calm her down when she gets angry by rubbing her on the head. This makes sense if she's supposed to be a little kid, but a teenager would find this gesture patronizing at best.
</li><li> The English localization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungriffon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungriffon">Gungriffon</a></em> completely wrote the plot of the game, moving the setting from 1995 to 2075 and swapping the protagonist and antagonistic faction. This caused a bunch of incongruencies, such as why the armies are still using 90's-era jets and armored vehicles as battlefield mainstays in 2075 or why all of the friendly radio messages adressed to the (now American) player character are in Japanese.
</li><li> The NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon">Double Dragon</a> III</em> rewrote the game's plot for the English version in order, ultimately changing the final boss's identity from a resurrected Cleopatra to Billy Lee's girlfriend Marian possessed by an evil spirit. This creates a bit of a plot hole in the final stage, which takes place inside a pyramid. The room leading to Cleopatra's tomb requires the three Sacred Stones of Power that the player's party has collected up to that point in order to be unlocked. Naturally, one can assume that Cleopatra was locked away thousands of years ago before the stones were spread around the world. On the other hand, the English version provides no explanation as to how Marian ended up locked behind a room that requires the three stones to be unlocked (or how she ended up being possessed by an evil spirit in the first place).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>: There are some common sense oddities and mistranslations here and there in the English translation of the game, such as:
<ul><li> In Sae's first appearance, a police officer is telling Sae in the original Japanese that they got a call from her boss, telling them to allow Sae to interrogate their prisoner. In the English version, it's translated as if the officer's telling her she's about to get a call from her boss, despite how odd it sounds for him to ask the police officer to tell Sae he'll be calling her on her personal phone, rather than asking the officer to hand Sae their own phone, or something similar.
</li><li> Shadow Kamoshida chides his guards for "mistaking [his] Ann for someone like her [the real Ann]", which is confusing because what happened was the <em>exact opposite</em> of what he's complaining about: his guards mistook the real Ann for his cognitive version instead of realizing she was just another "Intruder" like Joker and Ryuji. Essentially the dubbing team swapped the two Anns in this dialog somehow and didn't catch it, as in the Japanese he correctly mocks them for mistaking the real Ann for his "Princess" which was why Ann is brought to him, while the resulting line sounds more like the guards tried to take Princess Ann to the dungeons like the other intruders thinking she was the real Ann.
</li><li> Ryuji will mention his "Folks" at some points in the English translation, despite it being a plot point that his Dad left years ago and he lives alone with his single mother, who explicitly feels ashamed for having to raise him as such, even now.
</li><li> Futaba explicitly refers to Morgana as Mona in one scene shown after her slumber when her heart is stolen. Yet, when it comes time for her to choose a code name, the rest of the team has to explain to her what a "code name" is. Granted, Ryuji, Futaba and Haru do often refer to Morgana as "Mona" in the real world, treating it as a nickname as well as his code name.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaTheAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaTheAdventure">Castlevania: The Adventure</a></em>: The English manual is pretty ambiguous about the game's setting and the protagonist's identity, never mentioning him by name. The print ads for the American version promoted the game as Simon Belmont's third adventure, following the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI">Castlevania</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest">Simon's Quest</a></em>. On the other hand, the Japanese manual is pretty clear in identifying the protagonist as Christopher Belmont, Simon's ancestor, who was actually mentioned in the manual for the first Famicom game. The game's sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIBelmontsRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIBelmontsRevenge">Belmont's Revenge</a></em>, would be more consistent with the Japanese setting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em>:
<ul><li> On meeting Joshua, he addresses Neku by name <em>before</em> asking him to introduce himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He does, in fact, already know who Neku is — the plot hole is in Neku's failure to find this odd.</span> In the Japanese text, this doesn't occur.
</li><li> There's a random NPC thought titled "English?", about an English-speaking foreigner trying to find a samurai sword at the request of his friends back home, but having difficulty finding it because he can't speak Japanese and the shopkeepers don't understand English. In the Japanese text, this is the only English-language thought fragment in the game. So in the English text, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepItForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepItForeign">it's the only Japanese one</a>. Puzzle over that for a moment.

<ul><li> A more major one occurs with relation to the game's setting and subsequently its ending. In the Japanese version, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the game contains numerous implications that the game is set on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform">Terraformed</a> Mars, including the presence of two moons, mentions of the world formerly being a "Red Planet", and several references to actual Martian geographical features. In the ending of the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors">Arken, the creator and keeper of the Yggdrasil tree</a>, elects to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo">move on from the world to another that needs her aid.</a> This world is then revealed in the ending scene to be the Earth of the previous <em>Etrian Odyssey</em> games. The English localization, however, removes any and all references to Mars from the script, and at points outright refers to the planet as "Earth;" needless to say, this causes the subsquent ending reveal to make next to no sense.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Super Smash Bros. for Wii U</a></em>, Ridley can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">transform into Meta Ridley</a>... but this is highly inconsistent with established <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> canon, where Meta Ridley is a cybernetically-enhanced version of Ridley from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a></em> while this particular transformation is just his dark-skinned glowing form from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em>. The reason why "Meta Ridley" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> is because it's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a>: it wasn't originally Meta Ridley to begin with. The Japanese version of the 50-Fact Extravaganza names this form 黒リドリー, which translates more accurately to "Black Ridley" (note that Meta Ridley's actual Japanese name is メタリドリー). The connection to Meta Ridley is an addition made by the English translation despite having no basis in prior existing material.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em>, Peppita autographs her original Japanese name, Souffle, on the back of Fayt's shirt.
</li><li> The Western versions of <em>Shutokou Battle 0</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoXtremeRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoXtremeRacer">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a> Zero</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">renames most opponents from Japanese names to Western ones</a>. However, the Western version of <em>Shutokou Battle 01</em>, <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3</em>, keeps the names as is, so returning characters that should be recognizable by name aren't.
</li><li> The English localization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> has infamous one near the end by completely mistranslating the motivation of one of the series most important characters. In the original <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Xehanort, while dying, reveals that he believed the war between Light and Dark had become a futile cycle, and his intent was to end the world and start over from scratch</span>, something which is mutated in the localization into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">him trying to bring "balance" to light and dark, with zero mention of wanting to start from scratch</span>. The alterations ends up making <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Xehanort's</span> entire character incoherent, leads to lots of inconsistencies in the storyline, and makes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">Alas, Poor Villain</a> look <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">completely unearned</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MickeyMousecapade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MickeyMousecapade">Mickey Mousecapade</a></em>, in its original Famicom version, involved Mickey and Minnie rescuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> from the Queen of Hearts and her minions. The NES localization replaced most of the Wonderland bosses with villains from other Disney stories, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Maleficent</a> taking the place of the Queen as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, but retained Alice as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>, albeit referred to as a "mystery friend" until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> at the end, as well as the Walrus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a> and the Card Guard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> in the Castle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando">Bionic Commando</a></em>(NES):
<ul><li> The wiretapped conversation in Area 1 has the line "Commander, beware of the elevator". The Japanese version had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakePlatform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakePlatform">booby-trapped elevator</a> on the left side of the shaft that would fall if the player stepped on it; this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> in the US version.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a></em>, Maya's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a> is miso ramen. When the game was localized in America, the setting was changed from vaguely Japan to vaguely America, and Maya's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a> changed accordingly; she now is a fanatic for hamburgers. For the first three games, this was a fairly harmless change; instead of a favorite ramen stand, they now have a frequented burger joint. The problem came in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em>, when their favorite ramen stand becomes central to one of the cases and all the characters talk about how much Phoenix and Maya used to visit the ramen stand, making something that was always an element of the Japanese script look like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> in the English script. So, from now on, new works (like the manga) have her down as loving burgers <em>and</em> ramen. Then again, since Maya is repeatedly stated in the games to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a>, it's still pretty easy to apply the "she loves both burgers and ramen" explanation back to the games. It does still leave a bit of room for confusion, though, since it would have only taken a short line or two in-game to mention something like this. This was eventually patched in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Spirit of Justice</a></em>, where Maya is stated to be a fan of both burgers and noodles.
</li><li> The change from Japan to America also causes problems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Dual Destinies</a></em>. The second case of the game features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yokai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yokai">Yōkai</a> as a prominent plot point. This makes sense in Japan where Yokai are the regional mythological creatures, not so much in America. Ditto goes for the sudden existence of Rakugo practioners in the following game.
</li><li> And of course, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AwkwardZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AwkwardZombie">someone</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/comic/culture-schlock">had to capitalize on this.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In "Turnabout Sisters", when Redd White calls the Chief Prosecutor to arrest Phoenix and tell him that he will be testifying against him the next day, the voice on the phone uses the male (deeper) voice blips, and Edgeworth refers to the "public prosecutor" as male the next day. However, in the bonus case "Rise From the Ashes", we meet the Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye, who is definitely female and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>, entirely unlike the voice on the phone. This contradiction happened because in Japanese, Lana Skye's position and that of other "Chief Prosecutors" in the series (such as Bansai Ichiyanagi/Blaise Debeste in the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations">Ace Attorney Investigations</a> 2</em>, and Edgeworth from <em>Dual Destinies</em> onward) are different positions.
</li><li> A bug in the English version of the third case of <em>Dual Destinies</em> creates a <em>massive</em> plot hole not present in the original Japanese. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The problem? When you first meet Prof. Means, <em>he still has his staff.</em> In the original game it was missing, providing a hint to the true killer. The plot hole only becomes apparent once the staff is revealed to be the true murder weapon.</span> Thankfully the bug was fixed when the game was ported to iOS.
</li><li> If <em>Ace Attorney</em> happens in the US, then why did Edgeworth take up his prosecuting career in California instead of a part of the country without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">earthquakes</a>? Because the country is really Japan, no such place exists there, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">the idea of a place without earthquakes wouldn't occur to a Japanese writer or audience</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> with cases involving firearms. In a few cases it's an issue that guns are hard to obtain which makes sense in the original version since gun regulations in Japan are very strict, but USA has the <em>constitutional</em> right for citizens to carry guns so it doesn't make much sense that a gun would be hard to obtain. On the other hand there are cases involving guns where it's never really questioned how the culprit obtained a gun in the first place. In the Japanese version, it's a pretty big thing to leave unexplained; in the US version, not so much.
</li><li> More of a joke than a plot point, but when Ema meets Phoenix for the first time she mistakes him for Mia, an acquaintance of her older sister, when visiting Phoenix in the office Mia used to rent (never mind that Mia's been dead for some time). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">In the Japanese version</a>, Mia had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Gender-Blender Name</a> (but more commonly female) Chihiro, so Akane's mistake was understandable but "Mia" is clearly a female name so even if Ema never met her, she would've known she's not a guy.
</li><li> On two separate occasions, a plot point is that Pearl is unable to read kanji, leading her to incorrectly reassemble the Sacred Urn after she broke it, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">misunderstand the instructions in the written note Morgan left for her</span>. Since the concept of a separate alphabet doesn't exist in English however, the English version of 2-2 instead gives the explanation of her being unable to read. Thing is though, while a small child being unable to read kanji is perfectly normal, a girl Pearl's age being illiterate enough to mispell a simple three-letter name makes far less sense, espcially when one considers her backstory. More glaringly, however, when the second instnace occurs Pearl is suddenly able to read just fine, and only messes up because of the complex wording, no mention of her supposed illiteracy or an explanation as to why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Morgan would trust written instructions to her daughter unable to read them</span> is ever made.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</a></em>, Toko Fukawa makes an offhand remark where she states she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies">Has Two Mommies</a>. While left unexplained in the Japanese version, the English localization inserted dialogue in School Mode that insinuated that her father had divorced and got remarried. This got problematic when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanganronpaAnotherEpisodeUltraDespairGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanganronpaAnotherEpisodeUltraDespairGirls">Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls</a></em> came out and revealed that the two mothers thing came from an incident involving her father being in relationship with two women at the same time and a malpractice accident that left her actual mother unknown (Toko even says her father was never divorced). Whoops. When the latter game was localised, the team chose to completely ignore the original dub script and just go with the original.
<ul><li> A minor case happens in the first trial, when Leon asks who "Sakura" is after Aoi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">refers to the person in question by her first name</a>. In the original Japanese, this, combined with the cast being on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Last-Name Basis</a> for the most part, establishes that the students aren't exactly familiar with their classmates' first names, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is part of the reason why not everyone notices that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingClue">11037</a>" is supposed to be Leon's first name.</span> In the localized version, it merely seems as though Leon's bad with names.
</li><li> The localization team was also unable to licence <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganronpaZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganronpaZero">Danganronpa Zero</a></em>, which is problematic given a large amount of the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</a></em> hinges on one reading the novel, since many of the plot twists otherwise come out of complete and utter nowhere and there are several references to the book that are rendered meaningless. A good example is, in the final trial, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Junko makes a glitched statement about "Yasuke" and "the pain of losing ones beloved". If you hadn't read <em>DR0</em> and thus don't know about Yasuke Matsuda, this line is a complete and utter non-sequiter.</span>
</li><li> A minor example related to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltraDespairGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltraDespairGirls">Ultra Despair Girls</a></em> is Toko's nickname for Komaru, "Omaru", which means toilet. This isn't translated in the dub, which leaves many people scratching their heads as to why the nickname offends Komaru or why Toko uses it at all, when it sounds no different than her actual name. Similarly unexplained is the insult Toko makes about the training potty that serves as a save point being like a "buddy" for Komaru.
</li><li> Throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaV3KillingHarmony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaV3KillingHarmony">Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony</a></em>, the game consistently uses a different word to refer to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> (張本人, commonly fan-translated as "Ringleader", instead of the more common 首謀者), a nuance ignored in the localization, which sticks to just using "Mastermind". This causes problems because, in the final trial, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tsumugi Shirogane says that, while she may be the mastermind (張本人), the actual mastermind (首謀者) is the outside world desiring the killing games</span>. This results in the localization having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tsumugi claim they're <em>both</em> the mastermind</span>, turning a fairly major twist revealing the true meaning behind a seemingly minor detail into utter nonsense.

Since Sigma didn't mention that Clay Dolls are people or that Brother is old, this proves that the suspect is the culprit. While the second hint still works in the English version, the first one is more problematic because "Clay Dolls" were re-named "Myrmidons", who <em>were</em> a group of people from Greek mythology so even if the suspect didn't know what Sigma was talking about, assuming that they were people doesn't seem like much of a stretch if you know anything about Greek mythology.

This is impossible to convey in English, so all versions of the game are left to instead act like removing the "i" somehow allowed her a fresh start.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> was dubbed by 4Kids, and therefore had a few of these:
<ul><li> In one episode, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.angelfire.com/la3/goldenroad15/episode36.html">Tecna shot a "Sphere of Truth"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at a teacher she thought was evil without any ill effect, but then <a class="urllink" href="http://www.angelfire.com/la3/goldenroad15/episode49.html">the teacher turned out to be an evil clone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> much later (the very kind of thing her spell was supposed to expose). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids</a> never bothered to cover this up at all. It had been originally a plasma sphere, and one can assume that 4K changed it because it was violent. (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XDnmqD7Q5Y">Here's a video.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> One episode was butchered so badly 4Kids had to tack on a completely new ending using recycled footage to explain away a plot hole (In the original episode, the witches were running an additional test for the Dragon Fire. In the dub, they captured the fire outright, causing the plot hole, but it escapes for whatever odd reason)... Creating a <em>new</em> one when Icy appears in her witch clothing and makeup in a split second <em>somehow</em> after being in regular clothing. The lip flaps are also poorly done and don't at all match the dialogue being said.
</li><li> A rather extreme example: in S3, Icy supposedly gets a new fire power from the season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and boasts about it. Yet just a few minutes later, she attacks Bloom (who has a similar fire power, only more powerful) with nothing but her usual ice attacks. Lather, rinse, repeat <em>for the whole season</em>. So you're thinking that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">they wasted a perfectly good</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum">power</a>, right? But <a class="urllink" href="http://spiderbraids.livejournal.com/56900.html">the original version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> doesn't have Icy boasting about a new power, and the fire was just there for show, so to speak. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMEowH5X84k">Clip.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In the first season, Musa is constantly referred to as a princess, something made up for the American dub. When an episode in the second season involved her past as a middle-class citizen, a line was inserted about Musa's dad being a "former prince", which was not a very convincing explanation.
</li><li> Minor example: An angry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifter">"Stella"</a> is looking for "her" ring. Bloom comes in, so "Stella" asks Bloom about it. Her response differs: In the original, Bloom is confused at Stella's sudden anger and says "Calm down okay? Let's sit down and talk"; in the 4Kids dub, she says, "You gave it to me last night; you said to keep an eye on it." In either case, her response is met with an attack; understandable in the original, not so much in the dub. And at the end, "Stella" turns out to be Darcy, who seems more likely to just nicely ask Bloom for the ring than randomly attack her. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4j4q8_winx-club-comparisons-date-with-dis_fun">(6:38 in the video)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In the first season, the Trix trick Bloom into reading a book that warns her that she's the incarnation of the Ancestral Witches, and that they'll take possession of her after she becomes a full fairy. Both 4kids (and, confusingly enough, Nickelodeon) change it to tricking Bloom into thinking she's really a witch. Not only is Bloom's ability to turn into a fairy completely ignored by this change, it makes even less sense when later episodes confirm witches can become fairies, like Mirta or Selina.
</li><li> 4kids managed to invert this once. In "Tears From The Black Willow," the girls need to collect healing water but are warned not to touch it or they'll turn younger. After Darcy strips the water of its healing magic, Flora jumps in to save her sister. In the original, her sacrifice somehow breaks the spell while she's still underwater, although it doesn't affect her. There's no explanation as to why the water didn't hurt Flora in the original. The 4kids edit has Flora reverse the spell by herself after she escapes, fixing this plot hole.
</li><li> Another inversion came with Bloom's healing powers in the second season. One episode has Icy outright kill Sky and Bloom uses her powers to save him. Since Bloom's ability to raise the dead is ignored for the rest of the series (such as healing Nabu or Daphne...or restoring Domino), it's probably for the best 4kids changed it to Icy putting Sky under a sleeping spell. That said, playing this straight, 4kids still kept a line about Sky not having a pulse.
</li><li> Not exactly a dub, per se, but the Nickelodeon-produced episodes retconning Daphne's backstory. Originally, the Ancestral Witches outright murdered her after she helped Bloom escape. This was later changed to her being under a completely reversible spell that reduced her to a spirit, that also had nothing to do with saving Bloom.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em>, Fenton Crackshell tries to disguise himself as Scrooge. The nephews tell him that he also has to sound like Scrooge. In the original English version, this means of course that Fenton has to imitate a Scottish accent. In the German dub, he Scooge has no accent, so Fenton starts speaking in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellIsThatAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellIsThatAccent">ridiculous undefinable accent</a> for no reason.
</li><li> The Polish dub of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> episode "Accent You Hate" makes absolutely no sense through and through. Not only does Dexter himself have no particular accent apart from maybe a somewhat unusual manner of speech as usual in the show, <em>none</em> of the kids who are mocked for their accents throughout the episode have any funny accents, not even an attempt from the actors.
</li><li> The Latin American dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> committed one terrible and silly mistake. The gargoyles receive their name in the future, and are named after places of the modern USA (ex: Bronx). Yet, we see them call themselves <em>by those names</em> in the flashbacks of the past. It's quite silly seeing someone named Hudson in the year 988 in Scotland. Also, "Demona" is called by that name by the other gargoyles, even when they shouldn't have known humans had named her that.
</li><li> Hungary's dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> suffered from various problems, but the clueless translation was the worst offender. For example, in an early episode, Kim's sitting in detention, and one of her mates makes a remark about the nanobot on her nose, thinking it to be a zit. In the dub, he instead asks "You've been busted?", to which the other guy replies "Cheerleaders don't have zits".
</li><li> The English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em> screwed up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion">main character's sex</a>. She was re-dubbed into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan">male</a> until the <em>11th episode</em> in which someone finally called her a she, then proceeded to point it out in an argument over who gets to play the (male) lead in a role playing game. Since that episode, she's been consistently referred to as a she. None of the prior episodes were fixed to reflect this, and the change in gender pronouns is treated as if everyone had always known what equipment she had down there.
<ul><li> It has to be noted that, even in the original French dub, the characters are not always sure of Kaeloo's gender<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13sbvc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13sbvc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13sbvc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This may be due to her tendency to turn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut">into a huge toad when angry</a>: in French, the word for "frog" is female, but the word for "toad" is male, and Bad Kaeloo speaks with a male voice indeed</span>, especially in season 2. Whether this was inspired by the English dub or simply added for the sake of some jokes is anybody's guess.
</li></ul></li><li> In Japan, the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> was rebranded as <em>Transformers 2010</em>, and stated to take place in that year—about five years after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></em>, which happened in 2005, and a change from the original, which took place only about a year later in 2006. This doesn't change much until you look at Daniel Witwicky, who was twelve in the movie and hasn't changed at all in appearance or maturity. Reasonable if he's thirteen now, not so much if he's seventeen. A later toy bio added the retcon that he'd been put in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">stasis</a> for a few years at some point.
</li><li> The Japanese dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> renamed Bulkhead "Ironhide" to make him more recognizable to the audience of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">the movie</a>. This caused a problem when the actual Ironhide appeared in the second season, with an appearance actually based on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGenerationOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGenerationOne">G1</a> incarnation. The Japanese dub renamed this Ironhide "Armorhide".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Russian dub, "Princess Luna", "Nightmare Moon" and "Mare in the Moon" are all translated as "Lunnaya Poni" (Moon Pony), with ensuing hilarity like "You are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">Moon Pony</a>  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Moon Pony</a>!".
</li><li> The Hungarian dub doesn't translate the names, but neither does it bother to translate titles (such as "Mare in the Moon"), leading to a very bizarre dub, where the characters seem to be arbitrarily switching between languages. Promo material explains that "The ponies have beautiful English names", but... <em>that</em> doesn't make any sense.
</li><li> In Boast Busters, the Japanese dub accidentally has Snips outright state in front of Spike that he plans to bring an Ursa Major to Ponyville, but Spike doesn't do anything to talk them out of it, which is probably what he would have done if he heard it in the original.
</li><li> The opening for the Japanese dub is longer to make room for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong">Alternative Foreign Theme Song</a>, and there is also an added talk segment at the end of every episode. To accommodate the extra scenes they've had to cut about a minute of the actual episodes out, and while they tried to cut out only the more minor scenes, it's occasionally led to a few plot holes. For example, in the first episode, the scene Twilight mentioning the book she needed from Spike is cut out, but this leads to Spike somehow knowing the book she needed despite her not mentioning the title in the Japanese version.
</li><li> The Croatian dub by HRT has a few instances of this:
<ul><li> In "A Canterlot Wedding", with the translation team <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">localizing almost every name</a>, they wound up translating Cadance's name as "Kadenca", which isn't a problem in and of itself - except for the fact that it's pronounced exactly the same as "Cadenza" from her full name, making it confusing as to why Twilight hadn't reacted to her full name when the name she knew is basically a shortened form of the full name. It also leads Shining Armor to say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadenza</a>" when Twilight asks who the princess is.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E1MareInTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E1MareInTheMoon">very first episode</a> (or rather the second half, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication">due to every episode being split in half</a>) has a particularly glaring one during Twilight's encounter with Fluttershy. To be exact, when Twilight asks Fluttershy what her name is, Fluttershy's voice actor audibly says her name instead of muffling it... and Twilight's lines about her not hearing her well are kept in, making the dialogue come across as inconsistent. The inconsistency sticks out even more with Fluttershy telling her name to Spike (which is where she was supposed to say her name out loud for the first time), because now Twilight suddenly knows her name despite having heard it before <em>twice</em>.
</li><li> A minor one in "Dragon Quest": just as Rainbow Dash, Rarity and Twilight are about to enter the dragon den in a dragon disguise, Twilight remarks that they'll never pass if the dragons hear 3 voices coming from the fake dragon. The plot hole stems from the fact that all three of the characters involved are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">voiced by the same person by this point in the series</a> - who doesn't even make a distinction between each voice - and as a result Twilight's remark looks out of place because the aforementioned "three voices" sound far too alike for said remark to make much sense.
</li><li> In "Sonic Rainboom", when Rarity flies up to cast a variety of colored sunrays with her new wings, Rainbowshine has the exact same line as Foggy Fleece ("I could watch you fly all day!"). Because Rainbowshine's original line was about her suggesting that Rarity should enter the competition and Rarity still replies as if she heard her say it, it becomes unclear where Rarity suddenly got the idea of entering the competition and why she's saying "Maybe I <em>should</em> enter" when no one proposed the idea to begin with.
</li><li> Big Mac being called "Veliki brat" ("Big Brother"), while otherwise okay if a bit generic, is brought into question in "Hearts and Hooves Day". Namely, the plot of this episode revolves around the Cutie Mark Crusaders finding a perfect stallion for Cheerilee on Hearts and Hooves day, who just so happens to be Big Mac; this is where his localized name creates an awkward situation because when Cheerilee refers to Big Mac directly, she sounds like she's calling him her brother (due to him literally being called "big brother") with the romantic elements kept in, basically making an implication of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> and Cheerilee somehow being related to Apple Bloom without explanation.
</li></ul></li><li> The Croatian RTL dub has done this by airing seasons out of order, leading to massive status quo changes that have yet to be covered in the dub. It began with season 1, with the last episode of course ending off on "The Best Night Ever", and on the next broadcast a couple of years later that would air new episodes, it started with the premiere from <em>season four</em>. This means that the dub jumped from the main characters going to the Grand Galloping Gala in the last episode to a scene with Twilight (who now all of a sudden has wings) learning how to fly and being referred to as a princess, various characters making references to her becoming a princess and the main characters somehow knowing exactly who's (possibly) behind the strange occurrences despite the fact none of the aforementioned events have taken place during season 1.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: The Japanese dub removed the episode "A Ladder to Heaven", probably due to cultural sensitivity. However, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Legend of Dratini</a> example above, this created sort of a problem whenever Cartman would get briefly possessed by Kenny (in the episode, he drank Kenny's ashes after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat">mistaking them for chocolate milk mix</a>). A clip from the dropped episode was even retained in their dub of "Casa Bonita".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> Two examples in the Russian dub:
<ul><li> The dub uses the word "magic" instead of "bending". Water magic, fire magic, etc. So Katara's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a> line of dialogue to Sokka in the first episode — "It's not magic, it's waterbending" — was instead rendered as "it's not simple sorcery, but water magic".
</li><li> When Aang asks Master Pakku for a permission to train alongside his friend, he doesn't use the gender-neutral word "friend", but specifically the Russian word for "female friend". Later, Pakku refuses to train Katara because she's female, as if he didn't already know her gender from Aang's words.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Brazilian dub, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmellerBee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmellerBee">Smeller Bee</a> is dubbed as a boy in most episodes, until the episode where she reveals she was a girl and gets voiced by a female. However, by the time of the next episode, her male voice actor returns.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Russian dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, Vicky is Timmy's sister instead of having her own seperate family. Which is kind of strange, considering she doesn't live with the Turner family and instead lives with Tootie, who is not Vicky's sister in the dub.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> has never taken off in France, its sister show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> has. However, because both shows (plus <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow">The Cleveland Show</a></em>) have occasionally crossed over, this has caused confusion for a number of French fans who aren't familiar with Family Guy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleLulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleLulu">The Little Lulu Show</a></em> has the Greek dubs of the episode "Beautiful Lulu". In the original version, Tubby says "homeliest" in a muffled voice, because he's eating chocolate, and Iggy says his toe is prettier than Lulu while they're making fun of her. The first Greek dub makes the mistake of having Tubby <em>blatantly</em> say "The most popular girl in the neighborhood" (counts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyism</a> because "popular" and "ugly" sound alike in Greek) and Lulu says "he said I was 1 metre with my hands up" as if Tubby said that instead of Iggy. The second dub makes no mistake on the muffled voice, but still gets the toe thing wrong because Iggy's line is omitted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Season 3 episode "The Kids" is all about Gumball and Darwin's voices getting deeper as they reach puberty, and in the end, they get new voices which are more childish; this was done to represent their voice actor change. In the Brazilian dub, however, Gumball already <em>started</em> the episode with his new voice actor, and Darwin's hadn't even reached puberty yet. Plus, in the end of the episode, all that happens in the dub is their voice being digitally altered to be high-pitched.
<ul><li> Something similar happened in Season 5's "The Copycats", where Gumball and Darwin randomly switch voice actors again. In the dub, they stayed with <em>the exact same voice</em>, not even with pitch change.
</li></ul></li><li> Also a Brazilian dub example; in "The Fraud", the Coach (who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLooksLikeADude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLooksLikeADude">Lady Looks Like a Dude</a>) says "I'm not a woman... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">who can say she's not lied on her resume either</a>. Brazil translated that line as "I'm not a woman. Who can say they've never lied on the resume?", leading many people to believe Coach <em>is</em> a man and her daughter Jamie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoDaddies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoDaddies">Has Two Daddies</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> In the French dub, all the kwamis use the same transformation phrase: "[Name], Tranzformez-moi!". In the English dub, however, each kwami has a unique transformation phrase, which leads to several scenes in Seasons 2 and 3 where temporary heroes are brought in and apparently know their kwami's command phrase without ever actually being told it.
