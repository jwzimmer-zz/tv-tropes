They create a civilization, nation, or culture that bases its social hierarchy and governance on whosoever is strongest among them.

They will benefit from great strength and martial ability, but don't expect them to put much value on teamwork. Their main problem will usually be that they place such importance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">personal</a></em> power that they eschew not just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> but tactical cooperation in favor of individual glory.

Grunts will usually be sociopathic enough for the heroes not to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">feel bad about killing</a>, but you can expect them to be especially easy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookFaceTurn">turn</a> with displays of kindness because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachiavelliWasWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachiavelliWasWrong">Machiavelli Was Wrong</a>.

The distinction depends on what type of story you're telling. A story about a contender rising through the hierarchy by kicking the asses of his rivals counts as Asskicking Equals Authority. A story about a hero confronting a villainous organisation whose members became ever tougher as he closes in on the leader counts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Authority Equals Asskicking</a>. In other words, if you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> because you're the toughest, then that is this trope; if you're the toughest because you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> then that is the other trope. Note that a leader who simply <em>happens</em> to be strong is neither trope.
</p><p>When this trope backfires, the usual outcome is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GungHolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GungHolierThanThou">Gung Holier Than Thou</a> - a leader who has no respect whatsoever of his subordinates, and who controls his minions solely by threat of physical violence.

<ul><li> The Gotei 13 is a military meritocracy. The only way to get to the higher ranks is to have the talent to be better at asskicking than everyone lower in rank. The captains of the 13 divisions are so powerful that they're the core strength of the Gotei 13: there are 13 captains and 6,000 soldiers in total, but if the 13 captains are defeated, the organisation falls. The head captain, Yamamoto, is in charge of all the divisions and all the other captains. He got that position a thousand years ago by being the most powerful and dangerous thug of all. He's more powerful than most of the other captains put together.
</li><li> The Espada are designed to oppose the strength of the Shinigami captains. They are therefore designed to be as powerful as possible. They were originally created as Arrancar and fought their way to the top. The ones in charge are therefore the ones who are strong enough to keep their position from any challengers. Prior to Aizen setting up the Espada system Barragan had taken control of Hueco Mundo by conquering part of it and then defeating any challengers to his authority.
</li><li> The Vandenreich has a similar set-up. They are led by the Stern Ritters who are the most powerful Quincies and have been even further enhanced by the Quincy King's special Schrift.

<ul><li> <em>Attack on Titan</em> deconstructs this. The military system in place makes sense on paper: the best and brightest defend humanity's center (the Military Police Brigade) and the rest either maintain the walls or go on scouting missions (the Garrison and the Survey Corps, respectively). This means ultimately the best soldiers are likely never to be where they're needed most, making them useless to the overall war effort. Few of them ever actually participate in combat. Additionally, any exercises that they do would involve drilling with their guns (as they are responsible for maintaining law and order) so the 3DMG skills that got them to the top are stagnated and see little further use because they're at the top.

The wizards mellowed down shortly after. The desert warriors known as D'regs do this with a twist; the tribe is actually ruled by ancient traditions with little or no actual decision making to be done, so being the leader boils down to being the guy who gets to tell charge.

This becomes a plot point in the <em>Minotaur Wars</em> trilogy where a new Emperor comes to power after a coup, and even though he is a much better leader sizeable chunks of the population won't follow him because he dishonorably assassinated his predecessor rather than formally duelling him.

He takes power instead after an impassioned speech deploring the idea of sacrificing a loyal and talented soldier to such a brutal custom.

</li><li> Robert Baratheon is a deconstruction of the trope. Robert is a skilled military commander and a fearsome warrior, but he didn't really know what to do with the Iron Throne of Westeros once he'd won it. Robert turns out to be a completely ineffective ruler in peacetime and <em>knows</em> that he doesn't have the right skills for the job.
<ul><li> Also partially averted in that Robert's grandmother was a daughter of Aegon V Targaryen, making him the closest thing to a living Targaryen outside of Aerys II's family. The Rebellion used that to legitimize Robert's claim to the Iron Throne, and the other leaders of the Rebellion (Eddard and Jon Arryn) held the belief that made him the obvious choice for king. Several other characters do not hold much stock in that interpretation... Including Robert, who bemoans that Ned should have seated himself on the throne instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Jon Snow is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> of the trope.

When Jon first arrives at Castle Black, the Night's Watch smith Donal Noye shames him when he defeats the other new Watch recruits with his sword fighting skills during training, pointing out to Jon that he had a highborn upbringing in a castle and was trained under a master-at-arms his whole life while the other recruits are lowborn and never held a sword before. This makes Jon realize how tough the other boys had it and he passes on his combat knowledge to them, wherein they all become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>. When Jon wants to leave the Watch to join his brother Robb's army in grief over his father's execution, Lord Commander Mormont points out that his fighting prowess would not help his brother's campaign significantly due to already being on the scope of large armies. After the first book, although he engages in a few fights and a battle, all major developments with Jon â€” especially after gaining the authority of Lord Commander of the Night's Watch â€” primarily depend on Jon's intellectual abilities, such as decision-making, negotiation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenPushingPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenPushingPresident">research</a>, and perception skills rather than his ability to swing a sword.
</li><li> The Free Folk/Wildlings also believe in this trope... sort of. True to their nature as 'free folk,' they don't care much for titles, fealty or bloodlines, but they will follow someone who's strong and competent enough to be worthy of leadership. Being 'strong' isn't a purely physical thing, however, as the king-beyond-the-wall during the book earned the title by being charismatic, good at negotiating and having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionaryVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionaryVillain">a unified vision for the Free Folk to follow</a>.

<ul><li> Gaining rank has a lot to do with asskicking. Both Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are given senior officer status in the Rebel Alliance just based on the fact that they are awesome.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a> makes it pretty clear that the Sith have generally operated on this principle whenever they have had a structure involving enough of them to do so â€” the Rule of Two just compresses it, so that one proves one's strength and becomes the Master by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">killing one's own Master</a>. The fact that this often ended badly for the Sith as a whole was the reason for adopting the Rule of Two and an accompanying shift to manipulation from the shadows rather than open conquest.
</li><li> On a less malevolent scale, the Mandalorians also have a tradition of following their leaders based upon this trope. Whenever Mandalore dies (given the nature of their culture, this usually happens in battle), the strongest remaining warrior becomes the new Mandalore. This has been happening for over twenty thousand years. More specifically, the strongest warriors fight over Mandalore's helmet. If there's no helmet, there's no fighting, and no new Mandalore. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicII">KOTOR 2</a></em> pointed out how ridiculous this is â€” Revan managed to deal the death blow to the Mandalorian people basically by just killing Mandalore and <em>taking the helmet with him when he left</em>. Later, they fixed that. Now either the current Mandalore chooses a successor (the person he or she feels is best fit to lead), or it's the guy who can get the most people the follow him. The second one happens if the Mandalore fails to name a successor before he dies.

<ul><li> Ork society. "Da bigga an ork is, da more dat 'es da boss." It actually goes both ways â€” orks know who is their boss because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">the boss is bigger</a>, but orks <em>actually grow</em> as a response to rising in the social hierarchy-the bosses really <em>are</em> bigger because you start growing when you become the boss. Orks find human social hierarchy very confusing because humans "are all 'bout da same size" and wonder how they ever decide who the boss is (some resort to picking either those who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelmetsAreHardlyHeroic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelmetsAreHardlyHeroic">lack</a> the helmet/hat or have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">the fanciest among other 'ummies</a> which usually works). Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka, the greatest of all Ork warlords, has a head the size of a human torso, and arms thicker than a literal tree trunk. He's actually closer to the size of a large Killa Kan or small Dreadnaught than a typical ork. Nothing more needs to be said about his strength, or his love of all things dakka. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And he's just the "heir" to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBeastArises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBeastArises">The Beast</a>, the greatest Warboss(es) that ever existed. In terms of asskicking each one was a hab block-sized giant with tusks like trees, that personally destroyed entire armies and were a match for Primarchs in a one-on-one fight. In authority, they commanded essentially <em>every</em> ork. Not even <strong>Horus</strong> came as close to destroying the Imperium as the Beast's Waaagh did.</span>
</li><li> Other such societies in the two settings include, but is not limited to, Norsca, Chaos warbands (especially Beastmen), Skaven, Ogres, Dark Elves and Dark Eldar.
</li><li> Chaos Lord gain their position through sheer power and favor from the Gods. The latter is gained by the Chaos Lord's quality in the former. Kharn the Betrayer, for example, is the greatest of all Khorne's Champions due to his <strong>phenomenal</strong> fighting ability. When a Chaos Lord is slain, the best of the warband usually take each other on until only the strongest remain, and then the strongest fight each other so that only the greatest Champion remains.
</li><li> Eldar also follows this trope; their leaders are usually ones who are lost on the path of the warrior or sorcery, so if they lived that long, you know they can kick ass.
</li><li> Ogres are the embodiment of this trope. The only requirement to becoming tyrant of a particular tribe is to <strike>b</strike>eat the (sometimes literal) living crap out of the old one.
</li><li> Given the Eternal War nature of the setting, nearly every single faction is prone to this trope, you only make it that high in rank if you have the skills to survive. It's only subverted with the Imperial Guard and Tau, who are instead privileged to better equipment and/or a good sized command squad to make up for their leader's lack-of-asskicking â€” though with the Imperial Guard's myriad of different regiments within its vast totality with practices and cultures varying heavily, they may play it straight too.
</li><li> Abaddon the Despoiler is the Warmaster of Chaos mainly because he can literally tear apart any and all challengers to the position. However, he's a bit of a subversion as well, since he's not actually that great a commander: on the tabletop he has incredible close-combat stats but barely buffs his forces. Great warriors don't always make great generals. This has changed as of 8th edition â€” he's still a beast of a fighter but he actually buffs his troops too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech">Battletech</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is pretty much how the Clans work. The warrior caste is very much in charge with everybody else ultimately working for them, martial skill determines rank and command privileges, and trial by combat is considered a legitimate way to air one's grievances or even overturn political decisions that didn't go your way.
</li><li> Subverted in a very subtle fashion, rarely explicitly stated. The Clan system selects leaders based on their martial skills in single combat. It <em>does not</em> select on unit-level tactics, administrative skills, or leadership ability. When the Clans have fought in large-scale operations against comparable opponents (Tukkayid, Operations Bulldog and Serpent, Operation Reckless) they typically get their asses kicked.
</li><li> Not entirely played straight however. The <em>Blood of Kerensky</em> novels make it clear that Khans (who are elected by the Clan Council) have to be able to play politics as well. Furthermore one has to be nominated (requiring connections) to be able to fight for a Bloodname (generally required to serve beyond the age of 35 and rise above the rank of Star Captain). The less successful Clans (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Smoke Jaguar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Ice Hellion</a>) tend to play this trope straight. The more powerful and thriving ones including; the Wolves, Jade Falcons, Ghost Bears, Diamond Sharks, and Star Adders for example, select leaders based off both combat ability and political prowess.
<ul><li> The Smoke Jaguars in particular deconstruct this trope: their leadership is so focused on fighting that they neglect every other aspect of their Clan. Lincoln Osis, the final Khan of the Clan, was a skilled tactician but an incompetent strategist. His total neglect of his Clan's industrial production or logistics meant that his Clan was never able recover from the damage inflicted during the Clans' invasion of the Inner Sphere and when the Inner Sphere decided to attack the Smoke Jaguars several years later, the Clan was completely wiped out.

<ul><li> Most depictions of devils work on a very orderly version of this. Demons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">similar</a>, but drop the "orderly" part â€” as a species dedicated to selfishness and chaos, the only authority demons consistently respond to is "they can kill me if I don't follow them."
</li><li> Also the drow that follow the spider goddess Lolth, which includes a great majority of the entire race. There are lots of rules in their society that demand severe punishments for betrayal and murder, but only the victims or their immediate families can bring a case before the high priestesses. Thus the only way to power is to kill everyone in your way and intimidate everyone who could make your deeds publicly known. Everything is legitimate, as long as you can get away with it.
</li><li> Applies to the system as a whole. Since all abilities, from ability to fight to ability to <em>weave baskets</em>, are based on level, anyone that is exceptionally good at something, even a purely non violent profession or trade, is liable to be able to take at least a small army on by themselves... and win. As there is no shortage of ambition and predators â€” literal and figurative â€” those who keep a position of authority are those with enough personal power to <em>kick the ass of anyone who wants to take their place</em>. Often ends up being recursive with Authority equals Asskicking, both in that getting to the position in the first place is liable to improve your combat abilities (even if you do not fight your way there) and that it is often necessary to be proactive in order to maintain your position.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> frequently shows how such things happen.

Her rules stem from the belief that the strong are to rule over the weak. Her other laws are often arbitrary and sometimes outright contradictory, but this is the one truth she holds to absolutely. Indeed, it's one of her unbreakable themes as a Primordial being, so she can't even conceive of another way it could be.

As a result, people in power have to be able to kick a lot of ass if they want to stay (case in point: King Erik BloodAxe murdered almost every single one of his brothers to keep his place).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ApocalypseWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ApocalypseWorld">Apocalypse World</a></em> it's very difficult to become a leader without being a very good fighter.

<ul><li> Ogre hierarchy is based solely on asskicking. Basically, rank and gear go towards whoever can fight for it, since Ogres lack the mental capacity to elect someone democratically.
</li><li> Notably, in the Dire Maul dungeon players can be declared king(s) of the Dire Maul Ogres by killing the current king (who earned his title by declaring himself king and killing anyone who challenged him). Doing so without killing any of his lieutenants is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a> that has a chance of dropping epic level gear.
</li><li> Also, the now-abolished honor ranking system lived and breathed this trope: The Grand Marshal and High Warlord ranks were awarded to characters who week after week were the most lethal among their respective factions. In practice, this required <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel">nearly nonstop combat for several months</a>.
</li><li> The tribal Horde races (orcs, tauren and trolls) all seem to be this. It's been stated many times that the leaders of tribes are the most powerful warriors in the tribe (or, in the case of trolls, most powerful witch doctors).

<ul><li> The Tal'darim faction of Protoss have this as standard policy. A Tal'darim can challenge their direct superior to ritual combat called "Rak'shir". There's an interesting twist to it: the supporters of either combatant can indirectly aid them by lending psionic energy to them. So the winner will not only be the stronger combatant, but one who has more capable allies.

The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Radiant Dawn</a></em>, delves into this and illustrates why it's a really bad idea to make strength the sole basis of authority; Skrimir's insistence on solving everything by single combat causes serious problems for himself, his subjects, and his allies, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterArc">character arc</a> is about learning to take the best course of action even when it's less glorious.

</li><li> This is how the Darkspawn Hierarchy works. The strongest darkspawn (the Alphas and Omegas) are the ones who lead the horde.

</li><li> That's also how the Tevinter Imperium raised to prominence and how it fell: the most powerful mages became its ruling class, slaughtered everyone in Thedas who was strong/proud enough to stand up against them and enslaved the rest, remaining the sole masters of the continent for centuries. While the Blight weakened it, the coup de grÃ¢ce came from Andraste, which, depending on the version, was either God's wife or a mage so freakingly powerful that it made the Tevinter Magisters look weak by comparison. Whatever the cause, an army of fanatical zealots and rebel slaves formed around her, and the Chantry founded in her name became the new dominant force in Thedas.

In most versions, this involves fighting the Arishok in single combat. This is even more apt when the <em>Mage</em> Hawke has even Knight-Commander Meredith of the Templar Order, who hunts <em>illegal mages</em> having to tip-toe around Hawke with kid-gloves. Even a non-Mage Hawke is implied to have enough authority that the Templars purposefully choose to ignore Anders and Merrill, two of Hawke's well-known Mage friends because of this. And if Meredith hadn't been able to seize power in the wake of the Viscount's assassination, Hawke would likely have been declared <em>Viscount</em> of Kirkwall, not merely Champion.
<ul><li> Fenris claims that Tevinter is still operating this way.

<ul><li> It is said that when Alexander the Great was asked to whom the succession would go, he replied "to the strongest." <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note574d4');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note574d4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note574d4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This may actually be the product of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory">Self-Serving Memory</a> by those who witnessed his death. The most logical successor of Alexander was named Krater'oi, but he was not there when he passed away. Those who were claimed Alexander had said that he left his empire to 'krat'eroi' (the strongest), with the only difference being the placement of the accented vowel. Krater'oi initially submitted to Perdiccas, who became regent of Alexander's son in the court intrigues that followed, but then Krater'oi was killed in a rebellion apparently started by Perdiccas' marrying Alexander's sister in a bid for power.</span> Of course no one ever figured out who was the strongest until the Romans came along and showed everyone, thus becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>.
</li><li> Along the Scottish Border that was pretty much how the clans worked too. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSteelBonnets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSteelBonnets">The Steel Bonnets</a>
</li><li> Attila the Hun was the leader of the Huns because he was the strongest of them all.
</li><li> In ancient Ireland, chieftains were required to be of sound body â€” if a king lost his arm or leg, he was expected to step down, since obviously he could not lead his armies or protect his people.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedsWithRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedsWithRockets">Soviet Army</a>, this was the way of selecting the non-commissioned officers. Justified, since the enlistment was based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription">conscription</a>, with all non-commissioned officers being conscripts, and the materiÃ©l was both very heterogeneous and overall education, especially in the Islamic republics, was generally low. Led often into serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GungHolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GungHolierThanThou">Gung Holier Than Thou</a> situations.
</li></ul></li><li> Perfectly in line of this trope, Russians and Europeans with this mindset fell easy prey to Mongols' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordesFromTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordesFromTheEast">Hordes from the East</a> who put military discipline and coordination first, allowing them to use highly advanced tactics (in addition to other advantages).
</li><li> Pick any animal species organized by packs or herds, and their social order will generally be ranked accordingly, with the strongest male exerting the most influence, both with regards to the pack as a whole, and with regards to the available females. As mentioned above, this included humans for most of our history.
<ul><li> The term "pecking order", in fact, originates from hens. Yes, even female <em>chickens</em> will fight to establish dominance. The alpha hen in a flock will frequently pull out the feathers of lower-ranked hens, often drawing blood. And since they usually attack the head, pecking out of subordinate hens' eyes is not unknown.
</li><li> Wolf packs were previously thought to follow a hierarchy of alpha, beta, omega, etc., determined by fighting amongst themselves. Turns out that this is mostly limited to zoos, whereas wild packs consist of a mated pair and their offspring. The hierarchy among pups within a pack does follow this trope, but the parents remain the undisputed alphas, and at about two years old, a litter disperses to form packs of their own.
<ul><li> Though atypical, this can even happen with domestic dogs: if their owner fails to establish authority <em>by the dog's standards</em>, the dog may declare themselves "pack leader" and refuse to be trained.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> of any horse herd is the dominant mare. She chooses routes and takes the best drinking/feeding. The stallion's role is to drive stragglers along and stay at the edges, guarding against threats. Taking down threat after threat wears on the stallion. Sometimes he'll allow a younger stallion to join him, though it means he'll eventually be displaced, thus making for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfTwo">sith apprenticeship.</a></em> However, the position of stallion is dependent on the collective graces of the mares- if they don't like a stallion they might gang up to attack him and drive him away even if he's the strongest around.
</li><li> Chimpanzees subvert this trope as often as they play it straight. The dominant male of a troop is often the best fighter, but if he's not skilled at troop politics and tries to be too much of a bully, other males might team up to attack him together, using superior numbers to make up for being individually less powerful. This usually results in two or three males being co-dominant fore a time, often with the more dominant individual being one that's better at making friends with the rest of the troop rather than being the best fighter.
</li></ul></li><li> Warrant Officers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks">the United States military</a> are part this and part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a>. You get to be a warrant officer by being more skilled in your Military Occupational Specialty than an E-9 (highest ranking enlisted) in that specialty is supposed to be. Unlike regular commissioned officers, warrant officers don't need college degrees (though many have them anyway). Although outranked by regular commissioned officers, they still rate salutes from enlisted members, and can even be made company commanders in specialty units.
</li><li> Among the Ijaw clans of southern Nigeria, the cultural period before the rise of war-canoe houses and kingship (dated usually as 17th Century) is known as the "Heroic" or "Warlord" period. Basically, clans rallied behind strong fighters who organised them along war-making lines (levies of warriors from each family, garrisons). The top warriors in each clan ruled in council under the strongman, who could be deposed for failure in warfare, or a challenge to single combat. Many of the founding warlords have been elevated to deity status, becoming "patron saints" of combat and national cult heroes for their clans (Fenibeso for Okrika, Egbesu for many of the central Ijaws).
</li><li> Democratic Elections are (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician">sometimes</a>) a more civilized form of this. When you think about it they are a non-violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion">Combat by Champion</a> involving an exchange of insults until the one whose reputation has been least destroyed gets the privilege of taking office and being blamed for all the evils of the world for his entire term. In any case it is about giving power to the one who was victorious in a contest.
</li><li> This trope is a nice summation of the fascist worldview. In the 1930s and '40s, when it was also sometimes referred to as "Realism" in relation to foreign policy, Orwell summed it up with a supposed quote from Germany's "Iron Chancellor" Bismark: when asked if a failure in foreign policy had been caused by being too harsh to a defeated enemy, Bismark was supposed to have replied "No, it was clearly caused because we <em>weren't harsh enough</em>".
</li><li> William Marshall was one of the most important English military commanders and at the end of his life the regent of the kingdom. While his father and elder brother had held the office of Marshall, he was sent to France as a child, where he eventually became one of the greatest champions in knight tournaments. He first got a foot into politics when he was chosen as the personal coach for the son of the king of England, <em>because</em> he was the greatest fighter in all of Europe! Even in his 70s he still fought in major battles, which probably helped him a lot in being chosen as the regent for the infant king after the death of King John.
</li><li> This was how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">Henry IV, Edward IV, and Henry VII became King of England</a>, securing their throne on the battlefield and eliminating opponents through violence. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> by contemporary history, however, in that basing the legitimacy of rule on this means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">the king can find it difficult to pursue a non-war oriented governance policy</a>, which either a) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">keeps your reign in conflict and breed resentment throughout it</a>, or b) it gets you killed in the end. Notably, Henry V (son of Henry IV) found that the best way to avert this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit">Genghis Gambit</a>.
<ul><li> For that matter, it's how William <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">the Conqueror</a> became King of England. A French duke who'd never lived in England, while he <em>was</em> a cousin of the childless King Edward the Confessor, William was far from being his most obvious heir. Even his status as Duke of Normandy previously had to be secured by force since he was the <em>illegitimate</em> son of the previous duke. Edward's son-in-law Harold Godwinson was instead crowned as the next king, so William invaded England and defeated him in battle to seize the throne. one account even claims that William personally killed Harold on the field of battle, but this is considered highly unlikely and most accounts say Harold died after being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">shot in the eye</a> by one of William's archers.
</li></ul></li><li> Americans seem to <em>love</em> electing U.S. Presidents who were war heroes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> here, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> being a more modern example. Other notable Presidents who fought in wars were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_military_service">A full list of Presidents' military service is here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Two examples from Nazi Germany:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> won an Iron Cross First Class and an Iron Cross Second Class during the First World War. Having those decorations helped to give him the confidence to stand up to the generals during the Second World War.
</li><li> Hermann Goering's main qualification for being in charge of the Luftwaffe was that he had been a successful fighter pilot in the First World War. However, the skills required to lead a small group into combat are not the same as those required to lead a large organisation.
</li></ul></li><li> Before founding the Fascist Party, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenitoMussolini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenitoMussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> had fought in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> as a <em>bersagliere</em> (Italy's shock troops, best known for their good aim and toughness), being promoted to corporal for valour in combat and often volunteering for the most dangerous missions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">until the bomb-thrower he volunteered to use blew up on his face</a>.
</li><li> Daniel Inouye was a Medal of Honor recipient who received said award for the insane badassery he pulled during the Italian Campaign of World War II (including slaughtering several German soldiers <em>after having his arm blown off by a grenade</em>). After the war, he went to be elected to the US Senate, becoming both the longest-serving senator in history and the President pro tempore of the United States Senate. His reputation as a war hero obviously helped him here.
