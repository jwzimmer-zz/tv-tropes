<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> One of the classics is Arkham Asylum from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>, although this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> a few times in the comics (e.g., as the effect of a curse). Not only is Arkham Asylum worthless, it seems to make its inmates <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoAmongMadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoAmongMadPeople">worse</a></em> instead of better. (What did you expect? It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse">ARKHAM!</a> <em>Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">insane laughter</a></em>.)
<ul><li> Mr. Freeze murdered a psychiatrist who was questioning him without problems (no guards, or even a surveillance camera on the room), somehow hacking the Air Conditioner systems with a pen, stepping outside and walking to a nearby room housing his suit. Bear in mind that if it wasn't for that suit he wouldn't be able to escape at all. It's comforting that even after a general reboot, some things won't ever change.
</li><li> One of the funniest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade hangings</a> on this was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, when a villain locked in Arkham learns that someone else intends to escape, and on a whim, with no planning at all, escapes as well.
</li><li> In issue number two of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>'s own comic book, a pair of bumbling Arkham security guards are fired because The Joker has escaped on their watch <em>five</em> times. This series was published in the <em>mid-seventies</em>. You know it's bad when people have lampshaded Arkham's poor security for forty-odd years.
<ul><li> This is even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Joker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Joker">Joker</a></em>, since no-one understands why the Joker is being released.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumLivingHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumLivingHell">Arkham Asylum: Living Hell</a></em> has Commissioner Gordon outraged and chewing out Dr. Carver about the fact a villain called Doodlebug was released, who then added insult to injury by having written in graffiti "Gone to Arkham. Back after lunch" on a wall in an in-universe lampshade of Arkham's security. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that the "Dr. Carver" who issued Doodlebug's release was an imposter known as "Jane Doe" who'd killed the real Carver before the story, adding to Gordon's point, as does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of Doodlebug being a serial killer who uses his victim's blood in his paint.</span>
</li><li> One comic mentioned that Batman is a bit rougher with his more dangerous enemies than is strictly necessary to subdue them for precisely this reason. If he simply puts the Joker in Arkham, he escapes. If he puts the Joker in Arkham with a couple of broken bones he will take the time to convalesce before escaping. Usually.
</li><li> Gotham City also has Blackgate Penitentiary for its non-insane criminals. It's just as bad as Arkham.
</li><li> After trying to traffic in nuclear weapons during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a></em>, the Joker got sent to Slabside Penitentiary, which is nicknamed "the Slab". Supposedly, no villain has ever broken out of it. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JokersLastLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JokersLastLaugh">Joker's Last Laugh</a></em>, the Joker is informed that he has terminal cancer. It takes him all of about five minutes to think up a plan to not only break himself out, but break out most of the other villains with him, <em>and</em> use the prison's own anti-riot countermeasures to "Jokerize" them all. Maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>'s prisons aren't cardboard prisons. Maybe the Joker is just that good. The two aren't mutually exclusive. However, after it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> got invoked and subsequent stories would see the Joker once again being housed in Arkham.
</li><li> In the case of the inmate named Amygdala, Arkham's treatment actually made him <em>worse</em>. A violent sociopath, after drugs and therapy failed, they tried experimental surgery, and removed the part of his brain he is now named after. It made him even <em>more</em> violent and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">nearly mindless</a>, easily manipulated by Gotham's smarter criminals.
</li><li> This is lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush">Batman: Hush</a></em> by Dick.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dick:</strong> But you caught the bad guy. The Joker's back in Arkham for, like, the seventy-ninth time — where maybe we can hold onto him for more than an hour and a half this time...
</div></li><li> In "Letter to Batman", from <em>Legends of the Dark Knight</em>, Batman drags an unconscious Joker by the collar to Arkham, and tells the guards, "Here he is. Again. Make sure he stays a while this time." The next page of the comic shows Alfred telling Bruce that the Joker just escaped from Arkham.
</li><li> Also lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheCapedCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheCapedCrusader">Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?</a></em> by Alfred (context: in Alfred's story, all Batman's villains are actors employed by him to let Master Bruce live out his <em>completely ridiculous</em> fantasy without getting himself killed. Arkham doesn't hold its prisoners because it's not <em>meant</em> to.)
<div class="indent"><strong>Alfred:</strong> They took Eddie Nash to the madhouse. The <strong>real</strong> one, not Arkham.
</div></li><li> This is discussed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em> revamp of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBatman">Superman/Batman</a></em>. Batman meets his older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Earth2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Earth2">Earth 2</a> counterpart, and finds out that Earth 2 Gotham is now crime-free thanks to the Supreme Court closing down Arkham and authorizing the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">cryogenic stasis</a> to permanently inter supervillains. A brief glimpse of the facility shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> and even Sinestro quietly locked up and frozen. That's not enough for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the new Batman</span> in the <em>Earth 2</em> series, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoots the Joker without waking him</span>.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em>, Joker breaks <em>into</em> Arkham, quipping that he was feeling "a bit screwloose". He then proceeds to release everyone.
</li><li> Even the much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> campy 60's version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em> showed how poor Gotham corrections could be at times. At the beginning of one episode, King Tut was being examined by a doctor at the psychiatric ward where he was being held, who fell asleep while the villain was talking to him. When Tut noticed, he was simply able to walk away.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em>, after Batman defeats Black Mask and leaves him to be arrested, the latter mocks the former's reliance on the justice system, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">stating</a> that he'll probably be bailed out of prison soon. Then again, he's still locked up in Blackgate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOriginsBlackgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOriginsBlackgate">Batman: Arkham Origins: Blackgate</a></em> and he only escaped because an explosion caused by careless guards provided a distraction.
</li><li> A recurring incident across multiple universes involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy">Poison Ivy</a>. She's usually in a glass cell, ostensibly so she doesn't have access to growths like mold. <em>Except she's constantly given potted plants</em>. While one may presume it's for therapy reasons, she uses them to escape all the time.
</li><li> Ironically, one time the doctors at Arkham seemed almost competent was in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Dreams in Darkness"; they were actually able to hold Batman longer than most actual villains could, but this prevented the hero from tracking down the true culprit, the Scarecrow, who was engineering his sinister plot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightAsWellNotBeInPrisonAtAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightAsWellNotBeInPrisonAtAll">without even leaving Arkham.</a>
</li><li> When Superman decided it was time to start running the world himself in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeGodsAmongUs">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a></em>, one of the first things he did was shut down Arkham and relocate all the prisoners. He even pointed out in an interview how ludicrous it was that Arkham could still be allowed to run when it can't hold prisoners or reform them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Harleen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Harleen">Harleen</a></em>, Harvey Dent knows of Arkham's cardboard status and tries to bully Doctor Harleen Quinzel into abandoning her research, reasoning that it would mean more criminals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense">sent to Arkham</a> who would otherwise have gone to Blackgate, which he thinks is more secure.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllStarSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllStarSuperman">All-Star Superman</a></em>, he tells Quintus that if he wanted to leave prison, he would have hours ago. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarSuperman">the comic book</a>, he demonstrates that he can leave at any time, and does so by getting Clark Kent out of a riot without stopping their interview.
</li><li> Lampshaded in one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> novel, in which Luthor is sent to prison. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a> immediately starts writing his report about Luthor's escape, before he had actually done it. In the course of the story Olsen mentions that following one previous escape, Luthor had later broken back into the prison to retrieve something he had inadvertently left behind, then escaped again.
</li><li> Justified in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>, who was fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">MacGyvering</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a>-powered escape device out of absolutely <em>anything</em>. For instance, in one story he waited for the warden to go on vacation, knowing the temp who replaced him would trust him more, then sabotaged the prison newspaper's printing press. He offered to fix it for the temp guy, and instead turned it into an armored tank which he used to smash his way out of prison.
</li><li> Writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElliotSMaggin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElliotSMaggin">Elliot S! Maggin</a> once had Luthor muse that it had reached the point where the only two items his guards would allow him to have were a pen and a pad of paper. Luthor had, in fact, long since figured out a way to turn the ink, metal, plastic, and wood pulp into a high explosive to blast his way out, but he would never <em>do</em> so, because then the next time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> threw him in prison, the prison wouldn't let him have a pen and paper any more.
</li><li> He once built a <em>radio to the future</em> and was able to engineer an escape. By calling supervillains in the future. Yes.
</li><li> Another had him use his radio — <em>one</em> radio — to build a combination holographic projection device <em>and</em> a ray that would hopefully give humans superpowers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Guess which mild-mannered reporter he tested it on?</span> And when they checked, Luthor had reassembled the radio back to specs to boot.
</li></ul></li><li> Intermittently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> attempts a solution to both the in-character problem of this trope and the metafictional problem of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">keeping losing villains effective</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">by having villains perform missions as part of the US government top-secret Task Force X, a.k.a.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a>. This program offers early releases for imprisoned supervillains if they participate in, and survive, extremely dangerous secret missions that are subject to official denial. Thus, the villains temporarily become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> protagonists.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>'s Rogues Gallery aren't imprisonable, because one of them can travel to an alternate dimension and back via mirror. Every time the Flash arrests any of his friends, Mirror Master goes and fetches them right back out again. The warden explains that they've tried to have the mirrors removed but prisoner-rights liberals won't have it.
<ul><li> There was also the time Abra Kadabra got out because he was allowed to work in the kitchen and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon">somehow formed the equipment there into a hypno-ray</a>. No, really.
</li><li> And then there's Dr. Alchemy, who uses prison for reading time and when he finishes a book, he turns the walls into oxygen and walks out... only to walk back in a month later with a new stack of books.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Vault" was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>'s most secure prison, but villains still escape as needed for various comic book plots. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Its cardboard nature</a> was actually <a class="urllink" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.marvel.universe/msg/97d5f38002cf6fde">commented on<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek">Kurt Busiek</a> as the reason the writers had it destroyed. After its destruction and the resulting mass escape (the final shredding of the cardboard, if you will), supercriminals were incarcerated in lesser prisons nationwide, with predictable results.
</li><li> The Vault was later replaced by the Raft. It was first introduced in the first arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers">New Avengers</a></em>. Said arc is about a massive jail break. A running subplot was Mayor J. Jonah Jameson shutting the Raft down, noting how much of a failure it was. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em>, its last duty was to execute Alistair Smythe, the Spider-Slayer, only for him to execute a prison break. In short order, Ock!Spidey kills Smythe, blackmails Jolly Jonah for giving him that order, and takes control of it, turning it into Spider-Island II.
</li><li> This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> crossover during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>. The Runaways end up fighting Flag-Smasher, only for Karolina to bemusedly point out that the kids had <em>just</em> beaten him and sent him off to prison only a few months prior.
</li><li> "Prison 42", nicknamed "Fantasy Island" by its inmates, debuted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>. It's located in another dimension, accessible only by certain teleporter systems, secure and heavily coded. Many superheroes unwilling to register with the government were locked up there, and were indeed its first inmates. It was supposed to be the final answer to this trope. Naturally, the anti-registration heroes on the outside engineered a mass jailbreak. Likewise it serves to be a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">what steps you would have to take</a> to actually make a prison immune to the kind of crazy shit filling the Marvel Universe. And as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt">predicted</a> by some annoyed fans, it later got taken over by the <em>residents</em> of the Negative Zone. Because it just would've made too much sense to place the prison in a pocket dimension that <em>wasn't</em> already occupied by various fanatically xenophobic aliens. Ironically, this ended up being what ultimately subverted this trope for 42. With Blastaar's invasion and takeover of the prison, the remaining prisoners (who at this point were mostly villains) were trapped in the facility, the portal back to Earth permanently shut down due to a warning to Reed Richards from the Guardians of the Galaxy about Blastaar's invasion force, and any attempts to escape the facility itself would cause Blastaar or one of his minions to kill them on sight.
</li><li> Any prison was cardboard to the Serpent Society, at least when Sidewinder was in charge; one of the benefits of being a member was that he could rescue an imprisoned member via his ability to teleport himself and others. Being semi-retired at the time, it was the only condition for his personal involvement.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XOfSwords">X of Swords</a></em>, the swordbearers of Arakko offer freedom to Solem if he agrees to be among the champions.

</li><li> The <em>Rantanplan</em> spin-off even has an episode where a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a> succeeded in <em>kidnapping</em> Averell Dalton from his cell without much problem.

</li><li> The same episode has Jack Dalton coming back to his cell and leaving again three times while one of the wardens is still trying to close the hole from their last escape. The warden just lets him take what he needs and go away, without even trying to stop him.
</li></ul></li><li> The first time in DC Comics that the Crime Syndicate of Earth-3 showed up, they were beaten and imprisoned in a bubble created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a>, and THEN thrown into a limbo between dimensions/earths. They kept somehow breaking out and causing trouble. Although at first not that often and, at least the first time, only after outside interference. Johnny Quick, Power Ring, and Superwoman managed to escape from the bubble after an interdimensional traveler passed by and somehow weakened it (no real details given). That was about 14 years after their first appearance (real time; in comic time, it could have been anything from a week and a half later). A couple of years later, Ultraman got out, but nothing at all was said about how. Owlman wasn't seen again until the Crisis, and could well have been stuck in the bubble the whole time until the entire Syndicate returned home in time to die in the destruction of Earth-3.
</li><li> French comic book <em>Le Mercenaire</em> contains a literal example of a cardboard cell. The hero is imprisoned inside a flying castle, which is in fact a giant hot-air balloon. Hence, everything is constructed of light and hollow material, including the large jar used as a cell, which is thick cardboard. The prisoner was relieved of any item that could pierce it beforehand (including his belt buckle), but can cut through once he receives exterior help (in the form of a dagger).

He then thinks up a plan to destroy Captain Marvel and, his mood brightened, easily escapes by simply <em>performing a mathematical calculation in his head</em> that "opens a portal to the fifth dimension" and then walks out through a wall like a ghost.

</li><li> The Beagle Boys (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney</a>) use prisons as a temporary home, and are known to jailbreak at any convenient moment. A recurring gag is that they receive a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBake">cake filled with tools</a>; once, the cake <em>was</em> the tool, as it was so dense and heavy that it could be used to smash the pavement, and the frosting used to dig.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em>absence</em> of these is actually a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>. Because all the supervillains the Minutemen thwarted tended to stay thwarted, they eventually ran out of situations that required a team of heroes to deal with. This was one of the factors that led to the Minutemen breaking up.
<ul><li> This factor is later used as a point of contention in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomsdayClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomsdayClock">Doomsday Clock</a></em> during an argument between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Batman and Ozymandias, with Ozymandias accusing Batman, and by extension the other DC heroes, of being so focused on putting super-villains into "prisons with revolving doors" that they haven't taken any steps to address the world's real problems</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="http://scans-daily.dreamwidth.org/956653.html?#cutid1">a comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> featured on <em>Scans Daily</em>, the Royal Flush Gang are out committing crimes when they are supposed to be in prison. Terry doesn't know how they could have escaped, noting "This place is locked up tighter than a drum." Despite the outcome, Terry's comment still seems like an odd thing to say when Bruce Wayne has told him all about his past, with one person posting, "Uhh, Terry? You got in, didn't ya?"
</li><li> Any prison is this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a> and his accomplice Eva Kant. The first time he had been arrested (alluded in his first story and shown in a flashback years later) it had been because his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">perfect masks</a> weren't known yet, so the police didn't realize he was wearing one and he walked out of a maximum security prison with a stolen guard uniform after taking the mask off, but later imprisonments, which happened after his masks and real face were known, all ended with them breaking out rather easily in spite of always increasing measures to keep Eva in for life and him just long enough for his execution, with their first times being particularly ridiculous due to what they did to break each other out:
<ul><li> The first on-page arrest of Diabolik has the title character kept in jail long enough to be tried and sentenced to death, with Eva (who at the time had just become his lover and accomplice, thus their relationship wasn't publicly known yet) present at every session of the trial. Diabolik, expecting to die, <em>winked in Morse code to tell Eva where she could find his loot and tools <strong>in public</strong></em>, so she could make herself a new life away from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>... Except Eva bribed the guards of the death cell to bring her Diabolik just for the night before his execution, kidnapped her stalker, and when the guards brought Diabolik to her he had the tools to make a mask with his face and brainwash the stalker, so that Diabolik could take the identity of the stalker (who just happened to be above suspicions, what with being a high-ranking functionary in the <em>ministry of justice</em>) and marry her, with the evidence being destroyed when the body of the fake Diabolik was cremated as per Diabolik's own last will (implying Eva somehow told him to do it, given it's the only reason he did it). The only reason it didn't work was that Ginko realized that 'Diabolik' had been drugged just as the executioner released the guillotine's blade, leading to the discovery and the bribed guards confessing what happened...
</li><li> When Eva was first arrested, she was put in a women-only jail <em>in a swamp</em>, with a train as the only way in or out, and brought out only for the sessions of her trial. Diabolik first kidnapped a top model to <em>convince the world he had ditched her</em>, thus getting the jury to pity her enough to sentence her to life in jail while he prepared her break-out. Then, knowing she had been recently inoculated, he caused a <em>cholera outbreak in the jail</em>. As the jail was being evacuated, with Eva and the healthy patients in the last cars because the forward ones shook less, he derailed the train and freed Eva, with Ginko, who had been distracted by a fake sighting of Diabolik somewhere else, arriving right after they left.

The guards inform him that the cell's previous inhabitant, "Tinhead Ned", used to escape with regularity. Rincewind dismisses this as an attempt to break his spirit by getting him to run around rattling bars and searching for hidden panels. Then he finds a message from Ned, telling him to "check the hinges". He discovers that the cell's door can be entirely removed with sufficient effort, and escapes. At the end of the novel, after becoming a national hero, he requests that the cell never be redecorated, thus assuring that it will retain its cardboard nature for the next person to wind up inside it.

Lord Vetinari believes that it gives the prisoners some much-needed exercise, and keeps their minds off their impending execution.

In the off-chance a terrorist actually doesn't manage to make a getaway, they're all but guaranteed to wind up dying within the next episode to keep them from talking about their plans. It's <em>extremely rare</em> for an antagonist to be incarcerated for good and still be alive by the time the season's over.

He arranged a fire at the Gotham prison to get his mooks on the island, and Harley already had control over the security system. Mostly it serves as a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage">Worf Barrage</a> as soon as the credits finish rolling.

<ul><li> A sidequest in <em>Origins</em> reveals that the architect Cyrus Pinkney designed his buildings with a style that was said to drive away evil. One of those buildings was Arkham Asylum. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">This wasn't quite what he had in mind</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Zigursky Prison, also known as "The Zig", in the MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>. Its walls are so permeable that bands of escaped prisoners freely roam the streets of Brickstown, the zone in which it is located — and all the bosses and archvillains who take advantage of its apparent revolving-door policies. The tutorial in the counterpart <em>City of Villains</em> has your character escaping the Zig as part of a massive prison break.
<ul><li> Also, some mission maps contain prison areas where your character goes if defeated. When you wake up, all that stands between you and freedom are some guards and a door that can't take more than a few good shots from whatever powers you have.

The guard has a sensitive nose that can be irritated by dust from your cell's doormat, incapacitating him. If you're locked up again, he acquires a gas mask which you persuade him to take off. If you're locked up again, the guard has quit in disgust, leaving a note that the key is under the mat.

The bars of the prison cell are upgraded to lasers to prevent this from happening again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MarvelAvengersAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MarvelAvengersAlliance">Marvel: Avengers Alliance</a></em>, there are numerous missions where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> are escapees from Ryker Island or the Raft.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>, Papyrus' attempts at containing the player if he captures them is basically his shed with bars so wide you can walk right through, a note asking the player not to escape and the shed being locked from the inside.
</li><li> The Perpetual Testing Initiative DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> has the player enter a universe where Cave Johnson is the warden of a prison in space, where the only doors are force fields because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>.

Locks that don't open when the power goes out. Man, those blue force fields looked good, though. Every time I saw one, I thought, "Wow. I am in space."

However, for some reason, if the prison's generator is off-line, then <em>all cells open automatically</em>, even though this means the bars have to slide up (i.e. this requires power). All the internal phones are knocked out as well.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion">Maniac Mansion</a></em>, youre thrown into a basement prison if one of the Edisons catches you.

Egon once installed a fingerprint ID system to prevent an intruder from shutting it down, but that was abandoned after a demon possessed Peter in order to do it.

(The Vault had tech criminals, the Cube radiation criminals, the Big House genetic villains, and the Raft had the most dangerous criminals) Seeing how someone broke into the Vault in one of the backstory micro episodes, and two inmates had apparently broken out of the Cube in the past (Hulk and Absorbing Man), they don't sound too great.
</li><li> Regardless, all these prisons are presumably abandoned for prison 42, the above mentioned "fantasy island" of comic fame.

Justified since the cells are only meant to contain Gems, and so have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFieldDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFieldDoor">Force Field Doors</a> designed to disrupt a Gem's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> body. Since Steven's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> with an organic body, he only feels minor shock akin to a joy buzzer when passing through the barrier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>: In "Get the Message", Lola and Lana play "hall monitor" and put Luan in a literal cardboard prison.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> captures his ghostly enemies and then ... returns them to the Ghost Zone. Which is accessed by a completely uncontrolled portal that opens whenever it feels like it. As well as a basically unlimited number of other portals that randomly connect the Zone to various points in time and space. This isn't even to mention that some ghosts, like Johnny 13, can open portals whenever they feel like it! It's small wonder that "caught" ghosts often return in <em>the very next episode</em>. The setup to one episode even involves Danny's father repeatedly <em>pressing the button that opens the portal</em>, with ghosts flying out with each press. There's <em>a queue forming on the other side.</em>
</li><li> The Plumbers' Headquarters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em> is absolutely terrible at keeping its prisoners under lock, despite being an underground base with advanced technology and several super-powered, trained guards. Most villains who get arrested are back on the street usually one or two episodes later, and villain Khyber has been known to break in twice without even getting noticed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em> any prison is this for Le Quack. In one of his appearances he is thrown into an armored truck by a police officer and driven away. Literally seconds later, we cut to the same truck. It has been completely destroyed. Le Quack is wandering the road alone; He is clad in the uniform of the police officer who apprehended him. In his second appearance he actually makes it to prison but just as the episode fades to black we see the same prison with all of its barbed wire fences on fire and Le Quack standing outside of them. There is no humor, there is nothing to even take the edge off. It's pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRaccoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRaccoons">The Raccoons</a></em> episode "The Prism of Zenda", Cyril and the pigs get arrested for breaking into Mr. Knox's mansion and attempting to steal the eponymous prism, although the whole incident was actually one big misunderstanding (long story). After Cyril and the pigs get jailed, Cedric states that once Mr. Knox clears things up, Cyril and the pigs should be out within a few days.

<ul><li> "Open prisons" do exist in real life, where "escaping" can often be a simple matter of walking off the premises. However, these are only intended to be used for extremely low-risk prisoners with crimes like avoiding fines, minor white-collar crimes, and petty vandalism (and usually who have a life outside that it's not worth throwing away for the chance of escape)—for these criminals, the loss of freedom and privacy is considered "punishment enough"; if someone actually does escape it's the fault of the prison service for assigning them to that facility, more than that of the guards.
</li><li> There are European countries where the only criminal charge associated with escaping from prison is the theft of one's prison uniform; mail it back, and an escaped prisoner won't have any time added to their sentence. That isn't to say they won't be made to resume their sentence if recaptured.
</li><li> For the first 40 years of Folsom Prison's existence, the prison had no perimeter wall. Instead, the prison relied on the presence of six gatling guns to intimidate prisoners into staying put. Prisoners who made escape attempts were identified with a (hilariously appropriate) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a>.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PabloEscobar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PabloEscobar">Pablo Escobar</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuxuryPrisonSuite">created the very prison he was sent to</a>. He was still able to execute his enemies and commit drug trafficking deals. Many civilians claimed to have witnessed him in public while he was "in prison". Soon government troops raided the prison and faced a significant cartel force shooting back at them while Pablo escaped his "prison".
</li><li> Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán Loera, a Mexican drug lord, managed to get out of a maximum security jail with little to no effort. He and his associates had to pull some mind-boggingly huge strings and had to spend shiploads of cash to do it, but his case caused such a massive outcry in the media, that the jail from where he escaped, called "Puente Grande" ("Great Bridge"), was nicknamed "Puerta Grande" ("Big Door").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini">Harry Houdini</a> claimed (and was able to back up) the ability to escape from anywhere. He toured England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Russia. In each city, Houdini would challenge local police to restrain him with shackles and lock him in their jails. In many of these challenge escapes, Houdini would first be stripped nude and searched. A police officer is reported to have said he was <em>very</em> glad Houdini was not actually a criminal. Houdini once performed this trick in the Tower of London. No matter what he did, he could not unlock the door. Then, on a hunch, he tried the door handle and found the door opened. The jailer, in an attempt to fool the magician, had deliberately not locked the door.
<ul><li> This may have inspired a gag in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> 50th anniversary special, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">The Doctor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">The Doctor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt">The Doctor</a> are trapped in a cell in the Tower of London.

</li></ul></li><li> Magician David Copperfield was able to escape from Alcatraz in one TV special aired in 1987, and he had an obstacle installed that most prisoners did not: bombs installed in three locations to hinder him.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Sheppard">Jack Sheppard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> escaped from a London jail four times in succession. Once within a few hours, once within a week, and the last two times in under two months each. It's amazing London didn't stop letting prisoners have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedSheetLadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedSheetLadder">bed sheets</a> by the time he was done.
</li><li> Scott Adams, the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em>, wrote about such an occurrence in two of his blog posts (later published in book form). In the first he tells the news story of a man who escaped prison by making a fake ID and a set of civilian clothes, and simply walked out. In the second post he reveals that the man had been caught outside a bar, intoxicated and making no attempt to hide his identity. Adams theorizes that the prisoner had simply forgotten something like a pack of cigarettes or a pair of sunglasses in his cell and got caught on purpose so he could retrieve them, certain that he could escape again, and that this time he wanted to try it <em>drunk</em>.
</li><li> Willie Sutton. Broke into banks, broke out of prisons.
</li><li> John Dillinger escaped from the Crown Point Jail (at the time it probably <em>was</em> the highest-security prison in the country, certainly in Indiana) by carving a fake gun out of wood (or soap) and bluffed the guard into giving him his (real) which he used to take two men hostage, lock the entire staff in his cell, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">stole the sheriff's car</a></em> and drove away. According to another version of the story he bribed a guard to give him a gun, and made up the story in order to cover for him. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus">Illuminatus!</a></em> trilogy he claims that he walked through the walls.
</li><li> This trope is largely averted in real life. A great number of people assume that any "especially dangerous" criminal could easily get out of any prison, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">it's really quite far from the truth</a>. All it takes is a few high profile escapes, and that security is based on the assumption that it can fail, and putting in as many safeguards in to prevent it. Guards must go through an exhaustive background check, and their training has a high attrition rate for a reason. Also, some, such as military corrections officers, have a way of minimizing the risk of an inside job through simply rotating them to a different facility every few years.
</li><li> Toño Bicicleta was a Puerto-Rican criminal that was able to escape prison several times (seven times to be exact). The next time the cops caught him, they didn't even bother arresting him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">they just shot him</a>.
</li><li> Two men escaped a maximum security prison in Greece by being picked up by a friend in a helicopter. <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090224162250/http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/02/22/greece.prison.break/index.html">Twice.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Actually it was a rental tour helicopter. Which they took from the ROOF... Needless to say, many jokes emerged. (What is [escapee] doing in the prison courtyard? Checking in.)
</li><li> A prisoner once accidentally escaped Fremantle Prison in Australia by being assigned to do maintenance on the prison wall, and falling off. Not wanting to harm his chances of parole, he simply walked back around to the main gate and asked to be let back in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socrates</a> was supposedly put in one of these. He was put on trial for what amounted to asking people really hard questions in public and making them look dumb. He was sentenced to death after suggesting he only pay a fine. They only wanted to publicly best him and were surprised when he chose not to escape. They tried to make an escape easy, so people wouldn't see them as murderers. The cell was left unlocked, guards would take frequent breaks, and he could have almost definitely have had a student bribe his way out, but never did for two reasons. The first is his philosophy on the issue and the inevitability of the situation occurring again, and the second is that he saw it as an argument; by being executed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">he proved his rivals unjust</a>.
</li><li> This was frequent on the roughest frontier edges of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a>. As the real setting wasn't nearly as lawless as it's portrayed in fiction, building jails was a low priority. The occasional prisoner would be locked in a storehouse, an animal pen, or, in at least one case, <em>tent-pegged down under a buffalo skin</em> while awaiting trial.
</li><li> Alain Robert, the "French Spiderman", has been arrested and imprisoned many times in his career. He's stated that he could easily have escaped from the jails he's been placed in by scaling the walls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">but it's easier to wait for his lawyers to spring him than become a fugitive</a>.
</li><li> In 5th Century Persia, Sasanian Prince Kavadh was twice sent to a place called "The Fortress of Oblivion" due to political upheavals. He escaped. Both times.
</li><li> Steven Jay Russell, the inspiration for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveYouPhillipMorris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveYouPhillipMorris">I Love You Phillip Morris</a></em>, escaped from prison so many times that his release date is now 2140. He did this by trickery rather than anything dramatic like tunneling or going over the walls though.
</li><li> It's not cardboard, but the walls of the Benewah County jail are in such poor shape that a prisoner once created a hole by removing the mortar with a plastic spoon, then lowered himself to the ground on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetLadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetLadder">Bedsheet Ladder</a>, just one of the many people to escape from there.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, a French POW made a deal with the guards of his prison camp — he would be "allowed" to escape the camp to visit his family back in occupied France (with the guards giving him false documents, skipping him during roll call, tasking one of their own to sleep in his bunk and generally looking the other way), and in return he had to promise that he would come back, and bring some rationed delicacies (wine, cheese, cutlery, etc.) for everyone. <em>He did</em>. <em>Several times</em>. Not as surprising as it first appears. Most camps for French PoWs and forced labor were small affairs somewhere out in the country close to the farms they worked. The camps themselves were guarded by the (newly-drafted) farmers from these farms who were too old or too sick for front line duty. So you have guards who often shared their meals and always their work with those they guarded (and rumors suggest there were also quite a few 'family matters' binding them together). Under such circumstances it is not too hard to see how such a thing could happen.
</li><li> Oflag IV-C in Colditz Castle during World War II was a strange case of being both this and an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">inescapable prison</a></em>. This is because, despite the fact that the castle itself was meant to keep prisoners in, the attitude of the guards was that it was the POWs' duty to try to escape. They had a gentleman's agreement that the guards would not go rough on the prisoners and in turn the prisoners would not harm any guards in their escape attempts. This, combined with the fact that most of the prisoners here were sent here because they had previously tried to escape other POW camps, meant that Colditz had one of the highest records of successful escape attempts for a Nazi POW camp. And, there were plenty who escaped from their original POW camps, but were caught before they could get out of Germany itself. Getting out of a prison barracks unnoticed is one thing, getting across an entire <em>country</em> or <em>continent</em> unnoticed is another.
</li><li> Of course, you yourself can invoke this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Just make a prison out of a cardboard box...</a> and see how long it takes for someone or something to get out.
