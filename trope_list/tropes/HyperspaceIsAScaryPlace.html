</p><p>In settings where this trope applies, authors will often take the time to point out that hyperspace or subspace is hazardous and fraught with peril, both for the characters and the ships that have to make passage through it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars">Crest of the Stars</a></em> has a peculiar form of hyperspace which is completely two-dimensional, except for a bubble the ships and missiles generate to travel in. Losing power and having that bubble vanish results in a particularly horrible death; people aren't compatible with two-dimensional topography.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunBuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunBuster">GunBuster</a></em>, this trope is used as a joke to scare the younger space cadets by telling them that ghosts appear on ships during hyperspace travel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em>Yamato</em>'s first "space warp" jump is portrayed as a psychedelic experience, with afterimages, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Yuki's (Nova's) clothes jumping about a meter to the right</a>, and visions of the Yamato passing over prehistoric Earth, among other things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199">Space Battleship Yamato 2199</a></em> revisits this trope. This time around, while the <em>Yamato</em>'s first warp jump is still a trippy experience, the trippiness is more subdued. The really scary stuff comes from traveling through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">subspace gate</a>, the inside of which looks like traveling through a very rough storm.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP">Tenchi Muyo! GXP</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a> protagonist Seina feels cheated when his first jump into hyperspace features no light show of any kind; he specifically mentions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">some of the weirdness from</a> <em>Yamato</em> when he describes what he expected.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldOfNarue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldOfNarue">The World of Narue</a></em>, hyperspace used to be much scarier but has been somewhat "tamed" in recent centuries. Strange alien creatures known as Serpents live in the hyperspace network, and their mere presence can destroy a ship mid-transit. The Serpents are completely inscrutable, and nobody has ever been able to determine why they let some ships through and destroy others. It wasn't until the Avalonians (and later the United Stars) figured out how to fight the Serpents that hyperspace became safe and reliable.
</li><li> Not strictly hyperspace but the idea of dangerous extradimensional travel is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em>. No ship can safely pass through a Chulip Gate unless at least one member of the crew has a specific kind of nanite in them: the kind that allows this person to perform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">Boson Jumps</a>, the technology behind the Chulip. The Jovians found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> that allowed them to infuse these nanites into volunteers, allowing them to use the technology. Which makes everyone scratch their heads when the titular ship, an Earth design, not only jumps through a Chulip Gate but jumps <em>eight months forward in time</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then it's discovered that the same kind of technology is on Mars, only this one is mixed up with the nanite technology being used to terraform the planet. End result? Anyone born on Mars has a superior ability to the Jovians: able to traverse <em>time</em> as well as space(on two occasions, a jumper ended up arriving at their destination <em>before</em> they left). Then it makes sense since the <em>Nadesico</em> had at least three Mars-borns at the time.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>/the first arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em>, there is "space fold" technology. The invading Zentraedi armies have little trouble using it, but when humanity first attempted to use it to get the SDF-1 out of harm's way, it didn't quite go to plan: the energy field that enveloped the SDF-1 during the fold also cut out an island underneath the ship and took it into space with it, the SDF-1 wound up in orbit around Pluto instead of the moon, and the space fold device didn't return to normal space with the SDF-1, forcing the ship to take the long route back to Earth.

<ul><li> In the cosmology of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, the space between planes (sometimes called the Blind Eternities) will instantly kill anyone other than a Planeswalker or someone without serious magical protection (either fundamentally transforming the nature of the traveler, or bringing along a pocket or tunnel of normal space to ride in or pass through). The constantly-shifting currents of metaphysical energy look pretty bizarre, but at least they don't drive people insane... of course, that could only be because even Planeswalkers will be killed by it before they have a chance to go nuts. The <em>Zendikar</em> block introduced the Eldrazi, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">otherworldly horrors</a> that originated from and live in the Blind Eternities. As denizens of the Blind Eternities, the Eldrazi are suitably maddening to mortals. In the conclusion of <em>War of the Spark</em>, we see what happens when a non-planeswalker travels through the Eternities without suitable protection. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The de-sparked Nicol Bolas is utterly ravaged by the ordeal even while his brother Ugin does his best to shield him with his wings.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> The entire DC Multiverse is basically contained by an enormous wall at the end of everything called the Source Wall.

Exactly what it looked like at the start is a good question, then.
</li><li> And just for fun, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity">who may or may not be in the DCU</a>, once opened a gate into the Void, stated as being beyond the Multiverse. It was completely white, which doesn't sound that worrying until one considers that it goes on forever and literally the only landmark is the gate, which is going to get harder and harder to see... Note: the Void and the Source are definitely not the same thing. Lucifer also once got to the Source... and ignored it as completely irrelevant.

<ul><li> In the Marvel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Transformers</a></em> comics, there's also at least one instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">monsters</a> living in the void between dimensions used as transport medium. When they got their hands on Ramjet, they tortured, unmade, and remade him until they got bored and tossed him back. The result: a not-all-there Ramjet who is simultaneously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Cursed With Awesome</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>: Being "tormented" at the hands of these creatures resulted in his becoming Unicron-class powerful, and keeping a connection to the void that gives him all kinds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> tricks (above and beyond what he had during his time as an agent of Unicron). Thanks, evil extradimensional god dudes! On the other hand, he <em>isn't</em> quite sane, and it's all he can do to hold his own atoms together. His presence is poisonous to reality around him. Not much fun.
<ul><li> In the IDW Comics "Infestation 2" crossover arc, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">they get loose</a></em> and are every bit as horrible as they sound.

It doesn't seem especially clear that the creatures from this IDW megacrossover are the same as the ones from the much earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Transformers Cybertron</a></em> based story, but <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TFWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TFWiki">TF Wiki</a> seems to be sure about it.
</li></ul></li><li> Later, by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Era</a>, they use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">much safer</a> Transwarp technology. Which has a chance of dropping you off anywhere, anywhen if you go off course. Fan convention comics reveal that "anywhere" used to include parallel universes and, presumably, <em>void</em>, until a group from one dimension was nice enough to build a safety net. They keep everyone they catch imprisoned in a single large city, able to move freely about it but not leave.
</li><li> The IDW G1 continuity is largely an aversion; quantum jumping is surprisingly safe even though a certified scientist goes on the record about how it completely flaunts the known laws of physics. Just don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">stand too</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telefrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telefrag">close</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">to the engines</a> during a jump.
<ul><li> Quantum jumping later turns out to have another big danger; if a malfunction occurs and your ship's computer tells the quantum engines to take the ship to two places at once they solve the error by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> creating a <em>second</em> ship, literally duplicating the ship in every single way as it was when the jump was made. This is not inherently dangerous unless the two ships approach each other. If <em>that</em> happens, it creates a spatial paradox and one ship will start to overwrite the other.</span>
</li><li> Also, it's a good idea not to let the quantum engines get damaged. If they're hit bad enough, they start forming <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foam">quantum foam.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> That's a good thing only if you enjoy being obliterated by a quantum force strong enough to destroy a planet.

He is warned that there are unseen, horrifying things lurking in there and they make their escape as soon as possible. (These things are likely why the enemy, formerly the sidekick of one of Invincible's father's friends, went insane.)
</li><li> Fleetway's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em> treats the Special Zone in a similar manner as the literature example below. It's a weird place where physics don't really apply, and a planet and an asteroid belt and some swirly things can comfortably be the same place. The characters originally considered it to be some kind of insane 'other place' you really didn't want to spend too long in, and are shocked to later discover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's inhabited. Of course, the locals aren't exactly <em>normal</em>, either.</span>

Then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">something</a></em> rebuilt Adrianna. Now, she's able to teleport through the Bleed at will, something that gives Cole Cash a screaming case of the do-not-wants. Adrianna, for her part, actually enjoys looking at it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable">Knights of the Dinner Table</a></em>, a rare type of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a></em> opens not into extradimensional space but into "Bag Wurld," an endless desert that connects all <em>bags of holding</em> of that type. It's not much good for storage, but with a very good map and a decent-sized caravan you can use it to travel to and out of any other open bag. Of course, if you <em>don't</em> have a very good map, or someone closes your destination bag, you may be there a long time — entire cities and fortresses have sprung up around adventurers' caches.

Or, you can spend an hour in there, and come out a century later. Oh, and its inhabited by all sorts of creatures which physiologically sometimes have only a passing relationship to the Laws of Physics, while Faerie is ruled by the Sidhe, a subspecies of humanity which was altered by hundreds of millennia of normal time (and who knows how long of relative time) living there to not merely channel magic but be one with it.

See the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">Quotes</a> page. As described in Literature below, however, the dangers are more mundane and along the lines of "Planets and stars are still in the way, and traveling fast enough to cross the galaxy in hours means that you can easily smash into one and vaporize."
</li><li> In the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends</a></em> continuity, <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperspace/Legends">Hyperspace<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is rather less dangerous than some of the other examples, but there are risks. A ship in hyperspace doesn't properly exist in realspace, but can be brought out by gravity wells. In the case of planets and asteroids that means appearing in realspace in time to safely change direction and go into hyperspace again; in the case of stars, black holes, and powered-up Imperial Interdictors it doesn't. That's why it's considered dangerous to stray out of established hyperspace routes, and mapping new ones is hazardous.
<ul><li> Going through a gravity well of sufficient size overloads your hyperdrive motivator (what you need to get in and out of hyperspace) and kicks you out of hyperspace; when you over load it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">it can explode</a> possibly taking the ship with it, so there's actually a safety feature that kicks you out before you run the risk of exploding. That's how a fleet of ships got most of the way through a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">system-wide interdiction field around Centerpoint station</span> but still had to conduct repairs. One of the ships ended up damaged beyond repair because it tried to go a bit too long with the safety turned off.

</li><li> One novel describes "Hyper-rapture", a form of madness caused by staring at hyperspace for too long; because of this, starships usually have windows that go opaque while in hyperspace. Staring into hyperspace for an extended period of time, if it doesn't give you "hyper-rapture", is said to make most people increasingly uneasy. It doesn't look "right". <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar">Death Star</a></em> quietly underlines Darth Vader's evil/otherness/disconnect from humanity by noting that he <em>likes</em> staring into hyperspace, and doesn't feel the usual relief when his ship comes out into realspace again; similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LukeSkywalkerAndTheShadowsOfMindor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LukeSkywalkerAndTheShadowsOfMindor">Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor</a></em> has Cronal liking it.

One escape pod has enough food and water to keep him alive for months, non-opaquing windows, and a <em>very</em> small area; he'd either go stir-crazy, get hyper-rapture, or survive those long enough to die from lack of supplies. Not to mention that rescue is literally impossible. Very, very bad indeed. As the person who inflicts this punishment on the villain puts it:

While Starkiller battles it, he muses in terror that if the navicomp is deactivated mid-jump, the ship could either be blown to atoms or never return to realspace. Eventually, Starkiller defeats the Terror Walker by puncturing the ship's hull, causing the droid to be sucked out into hyperspace. Starkiller takes a moment to pity his foe, horrified by the thought of what it must be experiencing, even if it's a droid.
</li><li> One comic shows that it's actually somehow possible to use hyperspace to go <em>through</em> a planet (though it's described as being more akin to essentially bypassing that section of space) but as the person who does so notes, it's <strong>really</strong> not recommended outside of extreme emergencies. Presumably has something to do with the fact that gravity wells can yank you out of hyperspace, so the result would be blasting out of hyperspeed within the planet's atmosphere (or worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">inside the planet itself</a>) and blowing yourself to bits.

Which is why computer systems cannot fly in it; they have no intuition, so they always only have a 50:50 chance of picking the right path at each branch (and your average trip through Slipstream involves a lot of these branches, so the odds slip with each turn), while lifeforms have between 70% and 99% success rate. <br/>An early episode showed what happens when you put a being who can predict probable futures into the pilot's seat. Trance ends up screwing up so bad, that it throws the ship 300 years back in time. Later on, though, she can be seen piloting without problems. Given what is revealed about Trance's nature later on, it's entirely possible she meant for the time jump to happen. Another episode involves a probe sent centuries before in order to prowl slipstream and map it out. Supposedly, a complete map of the network would allow efficient, safe passage to any ship, whether piloted by a living being or not.

It has random currents that can throw you off course rather quickly if you have a navigational failure, no landmarks to navigate by other than the artificial beacons placed by the various races, and there's even some rumors about things living in it. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They're true, and though some of them are just annoying, there are <em>lots</em> of things that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">far from nice</a>.</span>) And then there's the eponymous <em>Thirdspace</em>, a deeper level of which almost nothing is known because the only known attempt to access it (one device, opened twice) created a portal to the territory of an extremely powerful (enough to scare the Vorlons) and aggressive race that instantly attacks through it. Other less nasty but still dangerous problems include freak storms and vortexes that are capable of altering the currents and eddies and throwing ships off course, something that can normally prove fatal. Also, if you try to open a jump point within an already active gate, this will result in a very large explosion. <br/><br/>Hyperspace is in actuality a shadow of Realspace. Gravity wells from normal space create the vortices in Hyperspace, and the drift effect is due to the galaxy being constantly in motion. Hyperspace compresses the space-time continuum so everything is exaggerated while travelling through it. Hyperspace beacons constantly need to be readjusted and hyperspace lanes tend to change over the years. Another unnatural effect of Hyperspace is that it boosts the telepathic abilities of any telepath. Travel beyond the galaxy is said to be the hardest thing any one race can accomplish, and only the ancient First Ones have travelled beyond the galactic rim. <br/><br/>The First Ones have learned to use hyperspace rather well, with the Vorlons folding a pocket of hyperspace in on itself to hide a frigging enormous armada! The Shadows are even worse, being completely at home in the chaotic hyperspace. They never get lost and don't even need to open jump gates, simply phasing between hyperspace and normal space.

</li><li> Played straighter in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a></em> movie and the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, where travel through the Stargate was disorientating, made some people feel sick and everyone came through the other side freezing cold, no matter what the temperature on either side of the gate was. Oh, and it threw you out the receiving gate, no matter how fast you entered it. After the pilot of SG1, <em>Children of the Gods</em>, this was all dropped. This was later explained as being due to Earth's lack of the "Dial Home Device," or DHD, which is what they call the control panels the gates were built with. Normally, these regularly "update" the Stargates in the Gate Network to compensate for stellar drift. Since Earth's Stargate didn't have one, it was slightly out of sync with the rest of the network until they learned to compensate for it. This resulted in the rough ride. After this, there was only such a rough ride to the home territory of the Asgard (the first eight-symbol super-distant address) and to the <em>Destiny</em> at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> (even farther than that!)
<ul><li> Other episodes with a rough ride include "Red Sky", due to safety protocols being disabled.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> normally doesn't treat subspace as a bad thing. There are some exceptions, though:
<ul><li> Subspace containing aliens who like vivisecting humans.
</li><li> Then there's the problem when subspace extrudes into normal space. Basically, being caught in such a flux means trouble. The energies and particles coming from them are generally not healthy, and stresses can tear starships apart. And you can forget about trying to use Warp Drive (indeed, one <em>TNG</em> episode showed that excessive warp usage was fraying the boundary between space and subspace like a well-trodden carpet). Thus the laser-like focus of the Federation when it comes to Omega molecules (seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em>): just one of them will rip the space/subspace barrier for a radius of several light years. Get too many of these kinds of holes popping up and you can kiss galactic civilization as you know it goodbye.
</li><li> One episode of <em>The Next Generation</em> deals with a terrorist group who use a "folded-space transporter" in their attacks. There's a good reason such technology is not widely used: prolonged use causes humanoid tissue to break down.
</li><li> Wormholes containing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> the Bajorans thought of as the prophets. Averted in that they're actually quite nice and keep the wormhole open and stable (just so long as you don't go pestering them, lest you end up brainwashed...or wiped from existence). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Pah</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Wraiths</a>, on the other hand...
<ul><li> Other wormholes aren't as safe to use. The Bajoran wormhole is noteworthy because it's the only stable wormhole known to exist: the entrance and exit will never change position. In one episode of <em>TNG</em>, two Ferengi who hoped to cash in on a wormhole to the delta quadrant learned this the hard way when the wormhole collapsed and left them stranded.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a> <em>Voyager</em> episode "Threshold" almost treated Warp 10 like this, but the actual results were mind-boggling from a logical, biological, and narrative standpoint.
</li><li> Experimental interphase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">cloaking devices</a> (largely different from the regular, completely safe cloaking devices) seem to operate by taking a ship and crew outside of the normal realm of matter and reality, which allows them not only invisibility but the ability to do things such as phase through solid matter. This can go horribly wrong in two different ways. The first is if a person is exposed to the radiation of a damaged device. <em>They</em> become cloaked. Not only will they be invisible, unable to be seen, they will lack coherence and slip through walls. On a ship, this could mean a sudden jarring motion could send a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock">person into space</a>. The second is if the cloaking device suddenly stops working as the ship phases through solid matter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">If a crewmember is lucky, getting stuck in a wall will kill them instantly</a>. (Both scenarios were explored in "The Next Phase" and "The Pegasus", respectively: Geordi and Ro are able to fend off a Romulan in the same phase by throwing him out of the ship and into space; and the final resting place of the <em>Pegasus</em> is inside of an asteroid, half-phased into the rock after the device finally failed.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> adds "the Mycelial Network," which is essentially hyperspace accessed via the spores of a fungus that bridges the gap between our reality and the Network. <em>Discovery</em>'s Spore Drive allows it to travel the Network, basically teleporting anywhere in the universe nearly instantaneously, though this requires <em>prototaxi stellavoris</em> spores as fuel, a navigator who can intuit the Network, and a giant metal spaceship popping in and out of two different dimensions wreaks havoc on at least one of those dimensions. It's not explained particularly well in the series itself, but <em>Discovery</em>'s core premise is basically "what if hyperspace was a gigantic fungal ecosystem?"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTomorrowPeople1973" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTomorrowPeople1973">The Tomorrow People (1973)</a></em> were presumably safe when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">jaunting</a> through hyperspace. If they jaunted into hyperspace without protective gear, their bodies would be annihilated. Additionally, hyperspace was seen as a place where time had no meaning, but you'd return to your own time upon leaving. That is, unless some major temporal screw-up had occurred, which ran the possibility of freezing time temporarily.
<ul><li> Note that hyperspace was not instantly lethal. When breaking out, Elizabeth accidentally became stranded in hyperspace. While she was in deadly danger, there was a reasonable amount of time to deduce what had happened to her and mount a rescue.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> is very explicit about the "scary" part.
<ul><li> The most common way of FTL travels utilize a kind of hyperspace known as the Warp. It is a parallel dimension where there is no time as we understand it (so one can reach destination hundreds years into the future — or into the past), but more importantly, it is a sink of all emotions and ideas (and probably souls) for all races of the galaxy. Guess what? The mix isn't very nice, it is downright nasty. Traveling through the Warp means traveling through a very literal hell, complete with demons, dark gods and so on. Gellar Fields maintain a pocket of "normal" space in and around the ship, but sometimes natives leak through. In the setting the Warp also fuels magic, so local mages (psykers) are always under risk of being possessed and often hear voices, offering... things.
</li><li> For bonus logical headaches, there's a story about accidental time-travelers who were responding to a distress signal (also sent through the Warp) from a ship that was surrounded by enemy vessels... when they popped out, the ship they were aiding was nowhere to be seen, but they were in the middle of an enemy fleet, so they sent out a distress signal...
</li><li> It was mentioned a few times that Gellar Fields can only protect from small predators. The only thing that saves the ship from bigger fish is that they don't notice or don't care about puny humans. Occasionally they do take notice, and then a lifeless husk will join thousands ships that were lost in the warp.
</li><li> The Tau, due to lacking a strong Warp presence, don't have psykers, and thus no analogues for the Imperial Astropaths and Navigators. This leaves them with very limited access to the Warp, and next to no way to explore its nature and applications. Despite having advanced technology otherwise, the Tau are very primitive when it comes to psychic and warp-based technology, including their FTL drives. The Tau are restricted to the "shallows" of the Warp, "skimming" it instead of immersing their vessels any "deeper" (apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean">Space Is an Ocean</a> metaphors are plentiful when describing the Warp, but metaphors are the only effective method of describing a realm of illogical thought). While this means painfully slow FTL travel, even by the standards of the setting, it's a much safer and more reliable method of travel, although it still has its dangers. Unfortunately this also means that the Tau have less understanding about the <em>dangers</em> of the Warp than just about every other faction too, and even less understanding about the forces in it. Supposedly, they tried to duplicate the Imperium's Warp technology, but eventually decided "Screw this. Too many tentacles."
</li><li> Even staying out of the Warp doesn't mean escaping this trope. Sometimes, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Warpspace/realspace overlap</a> (known as a Warp Storm or Warp Rift) is generated that can swallow planets, star systems, or even entire sectors of space: the largest, the Eye of Terror, is roughly the size and shape of a dwarf spiral galaxy, meaning it's <em>thousands of light years</em> in diameter. It's never a good idea to be on any planet caught anywhere near one of these. While the exact effects <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">vary on a case-by-case basis</a>, the gist of it is that the rules of physics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch">take an extended vacation</a>, creating a lovely little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos">World of Chaos</a> in which denizens of the Warp can freely manifest, leaving them with plenty of time for Fun. As luck would have it, warp storms sometimes have beneficial effects as well. At one point the Imperium of Man found a Stone-Age alien species on an uncharted world, and as per normal procedure tasked forces to exterminate them. A warp storm blew up and rendered the star system off limits for about 6,000 years. Then the storm dissipated and the Imperium tried again, only to discover that in the interim the aliens in question, the previously mentioned Tau, had become a spacefaring culture more technologically advanced than the Imperium and fended off the incursion quite handily.
</li><li> The Eldar Webway is a labyrinthine set of tunnels and passages through what is essentially an artificial dimension between Realspace and the Warp. While the Webway is nicer than the Warp, it's still quite nasty and host to its own brand of weirdness. Whereas the Warp is pure chaos, the Webway is more akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries">Alien Geometries</a>; rational and internally consistent, yet utterly alien. One of the Primarchs was lost trying to navigate it, and Commorragh, capital city of the Dark Eldar hidden deep within the webway, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a> with architecture that makes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em> look reasonable.
</li><li> Of course, being <em>40K</em>, some factions just don't care about the mind-breaking horrors inherent to the Warp. The Orks coat their vessels in "teef" to scare off daemons (which works <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">because Orks believe it should</a>), but even if that doesn't work, daemonic incursions are treated as a way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">breaking up the tedium of long trips</a>. Chaos followers have a much easier time navigating the home realm of their patron deities, but they still need Gellar fields to prevent daemons from coming to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">collect on their pacts</a>. And the sheer might of the Tyranid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> plays havoc with the Warp and its denizens, meaning only the most powerful daemons can go anywhere near them, and they can't fight an entire hive fleet by themselves anyway.
</li><li> Last but not least, the Necrons utilize impossibly advanced technology so they can simply ignore the Warp. Their take on FTL works by <em>actually</em> going faster than light rather than taking a short-cut, plus as a civilisation whose people are made of living metal, they have much less problems related to warp sickness. Of note are their attempts to get the warp to influence their bodies and flawlessly combine metal and flesh (something only Chaos has managed yet) which seldomly go lucky. However, it seems easier for them to just use the Webway.
</li><li> The Warp used to be a relatively peaceful afterlife dimension called the Realm of Souls. The cataclysmic war involving the Old Ones + Eldar + Krorks (Orks) vs the Necrons and C'tan left behind so much devastation, bloodshed, and ill will that it permanently corrupted the Realm of Souls into the nightmarish Warp. The birth of Slaanesh sealed the deal and led to the creation of the aforementioned Eye of Terror, a <em>permanent</em> Warp/realspace overlap, in the process. A somewhat niche wild guess is that humans also had some influence, and if they didn't, they definitely did as the 40th millennium came to a close. Nobody fed the Dark Gods like humanity did, and the 13th Black Crusade proved this. Abbadon's destruction of Cadia produced so much chaos that what was once a few pockets of concentrated chaos turned into a Great Rift tearing across the entire Milky Way from one end to the other, spawning a new age dubbed <em>Noctis Aeterna</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qago');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qago" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qago');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though not stated explicitly in canon, it's pretty safe to assume it means "eternal night".</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> features the Paths of the Old Ones, a series of pocket dimension "hubs" connected to each other and to real-world gates by "tunnels" through the realm of magic. Since the Old Ones disappeared, the Paths have been tainted by Chaos. The tunnels are even worse, containing "reality bubbles" that travelers can be trapped in. These may vary from alternate timelines to a daemon's personal playroom. And if you take a wrong turn in the Paths, you may just end up in the Realms of Chaos. Or worse, what is heavily implied to be Warhammer 40K's Warp.
</li><li> The game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns">Fading Suns</a></em> uses an inversion: hyperspace (what is between the Stargates) actually is the <em>safe</em> way. The real problem is that interstellar space (the traditional boundary is the orbit of system's Stargate) is filled with shapeless Cthulhoid monstrosities going by the lovely name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Void</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean">Kraken</a>. (Something about the star, at least for some part of the star's life cycle repels the Void Krakens. The size of this safe zone varies with each system.) Still, spaceships jumping through hyperspace need to be protected by special shields, because otherwise people experience a strongly addictive quasi-religious epiphany. And fun stuff: before the discovery of Sol System's gate, there were several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">sleeper ships</a> sent out. One of them was referenced in canon. The rest... Well, the general assumption is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">it's better not to think of what could have happened to the passengers</a>.
</li><li> While not used for space travel, Porté sorcery in the RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea">7th Sea</a></em> involves tearing a bleeding hole in reality, stepping through into an hyperspace-like dimension, and tearing open another hole to get back. No-one knows what this dimension is like, because Porté sorcerers keep their eyes closed while inside it. Within this dimension, voices try to persuade or trick the sorcerer into opening their eyes. It's assumed that the sorcerers who never came back made the mistake of opening their eyes. It's not at all related that the country where most Porté sorcerers live also has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ghosts without eyes or hands that appear in its mirrors</span>. No, surely not. In later supplemental material, it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nearly all magic in the world of Theah weakens a barrier in a shadowy world that keeps an army of eldritch abominations at bay, and that every use of Porté magic to rip a hole in reality also rips a corresponding hole in the barrier.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> different cultures have different customs and/or superstitions about it. Among them, Vilani dim their lights (from when having enough power to go into jump was an issue), Aslan clans light a sacramental candle, Vargr, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">violent types</a>, beat up one of their crewmates chosen for the honor, and the Droyne use special coins. Jump space is not so much feared as it is weird. If a jump works wrong one could be misjumped to a random point, which could mean anywhere. If it works really wrong, one stays in jumpspace, and no one knows what happens. Technically, one only stays in Jumpspace for a few trillion (subjective) years. Long enough for protons, stable as they are, to decay and, 168 objective hours or so later, all that emerges is a flash of hard radiation.
</li><li> And the utterly forgotten 80's RPG <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a></em> had N-Space filled to the bursting with Voidsharks, "Temblons" (think kraken with tractor-beam tentacles) and other horrors that all seemed to find carbon based life a tasty treat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em>: Regular FTL travel is fairly simple and straightforward, if somewhat anemic as regards speed. Phase drives, however, are derived from the same technology and magic that the Prometheans use. They use this technology to shut portals and gates down on top of ships that are coming in, a fairly horrific action. But then there are the Rift drives. Though they normally travel through a dimension called the Flux Dimension, anyone who has played Rifts know that they're prone to all sorts of horrible things happening...
</li><li> Given a nod in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, where the Kearny-Fuchida jump drive is occasionally poorly looked upon. This is, of course, thanks to a long track record of damn near epic foul-ups that have happened. Time-lost ships, ships that have emerged with massive holes that look like they've been bitten, ships emerging without crew, ships that jumped too close to another ship and were fused, ships where the same happened and the still-living crew were found literally embedded in the bulkheads, and some ships just plain disappearing. Never mind the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Word of Blake</a> apparently figured out a way to keep a ship in hyperspace so their recruits have a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">interesting</a> environment to learn in. And it has already been established that looking out a porthole during a jump is just plain stupid...
<ul><li> The things listed above are the exceptions to the rule — K-F Drives are 98% safe, as long as the capacitors don't blow. However, the understood mechanics of jump travel are almost as bad as the parts that aren't understood. Every single time a ship jumps, heat is manifested at the destination prior to the ship showing up. The more mass being jumped, the longer and hotter. It basically builds from the time the ship starts its jump to the point it emerges. Contrary to popular belief, jumping isn't instantaneous. Although still faster than light speed there <em>is</em> a lag depending on the distance and mass involved. A huge, fully-loaded battleship jumping the maximum (about 30 light-years) needs about 6 minutes to complete the jump. Problem is, due to all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> from centuries of warfare, jump knowledge is either sketchy or kept secret. It's said there are two type of Jump Scientists. One who can recite the theory backwards and forth but make little headway in it... And those who are completely insane but in-between their ramblings they make discoveries.
</li><li> One of the most dangerous things about the KF drive is what happens when a ship jumps: Any other ship within a radius of about one hundred kilometers will be shredded, at various levels of completeness from "kind of intact" to "on a molecular level" with the higher end being the norm. Though the process is instant, it's been noted that on occasion a destroyed ship will continue to transmit for several seconds after the jump flash ends. Also, because of the physics involved, you can't jump in the presence of two jump cores, whether active or not. If you want to transport a jump core, you have to either use the core itself to make the jump or painstakingly break it down into basically gravel and then reforge it (at great expense) once it gets to the destination.
</li><li> The SLDF discovered that any trip via K-F Drive made all of their attempts at drone warship AI suffer what is described as a "paranoid psychotic break" in which they would lock out all communications and see everything that moved as a hostile that was actively attacking them. Any K-F deployment of drones had to be conducted with the AI powered down, then reactivated by a caretaker crew on arrival.
</li></ul></li><li> The Hedge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> can serve as a means of more expedient travel between long distances, provided one is willing to enter an ever-shifting maze and brave the dangers therein. True to the warped logic of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">its owners</a>, the time it takes to get somewhere depends more on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingAtTheSpeedOfPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingAtTheSpeedOfPlot">what happens along the way</a> than on actual distance, meaning that getting from Miami to Tucson might require more time (and bloodshed) than from Miami to London. In the Infinite Macabre setting, it's made explicit that yes, the Hedge can be used for interstellar travel, though the base time for navigation is longer. Oh, and getting a ship back out requires finding a portal that said ship can fit through, which is implied to be a rare occurance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EldritchSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EldritchSkies">Eldritch Skies</a></em> lives and breaths this trope.

While not as disturbing as other examples on this page, it's still dangerous. Besides some nasty creatures living in "The Flow", the multicolored "matter" that pervades it is extremely inflammable. Even a candle will cause a small fireball; any form of fire magic is extremely unadvised there. It as also some weird effects on living beings, like putting asphyxiating creatures into a coma rather than dying.

If you are thinking Warhammer 40K or Event Horizon, you are right. The ship, unlike the Event Horizon, did have some form of Gellar field, but shabby and inefficient, which makes a trip aboard it terrible but survivable.

While on the surface it inverts it in the same manner as <em>Fading Suns</em>, it turns out that just because the Portals are the less dangerous route doesn't mean they're automatically <em>safer</em>. In fact, Portal jumps require the crew to be in hypersleep as whatever makes the Portals work isn't exactly compatible with human perception or biology. The book makes it clear that, if the jump doesn't kill you outright, you'll need a new character as your old one will now be too crazy and maimed to be playable.

Repeated jumps in a short time, however, increase the risk for Void Psychosis Syndrome.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Starfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Starfinder">Starfinder</a></em>, interstellar travel relies on traveling through a dimension called the Drift. Technically the Drift isn't that bad, apart from a few native critters, being completely empty. The scary part is that every time someone uses the Drift, a chunk is torn out of another plane and added to the Drift. As a result, travelling through the drift now means your ship might run into fragments from every nasty plane there is, the most inhospitable parts of the good and neutral planes, or even hazards from the Material Plane itself.

<ul><li> Although not technically hyperspace, the plot of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> series revolves around teleporters that work by routing the teleported matter through another reality, which works well enough except for the tiny fact that the reality in question is literally Hell — the demons eventually notice the unexpected entry and even less expected exits and come through the teleporters themselves. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em>, it's specifically stated that the Martian civilization's use of this technology nearly drove them into extinction, and it took a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> on the part of their entire species to send the demons back and close up the portals again before they could conquer the universe. And then humans came along and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Unsealed the Can</a>. If the demonic invasion wasn't bad enough, even travelling through a portal to another place on Mars can cause paranoia and insanity. Makes sense, since the hyperspace tunnel appears to be a bloody vein-like tunnel, and you hear screaming as you move along it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em> has a similar premise: Xen is a parallel dimension that looks as if bits of planet and atmosphere, as well as predatory xenofauna, were transported there at random. Teleporters need to pass their signal through a Xen relay in order to return their loads to normal space. The relay is initially (when the technology was first created) a big machine attached to a crystal on Xen, but is subsequently "compressed" all the way to nothing; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> tells us that rag-tag Resistance teleporters simply swing around Xen like a dimensional sligshot, making teleportation cheaper and a bit safer.
</li><li> On the other hand, Combine teleportation takes the hard way and rips a hole in the universe. It does have some advantages, like the Combine being able to go to any universe they choose and wherever in a given universe, but teleportation relying on Xen is cheaper and uses much less machinery, as well as able to perform intradimensional travel (as opposed to Combine teleportation which is only capable of travel between dimensions, leaving them reliant on local transportation to get around once they're in a dimension). Some factions can even use it without machinery at all, like the G-Man, who conveniently disappears through what is either teleportation or a crapload of hidden doors before you ever get close. Also, the Vortigaunts seem to like where/when/whatever plane of existence the G-Man keeps using and taking Gordon to, so much so as to wrench him and Alyx back into reality from it at the start of <em>Episode One</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> universe has the Twisting Nether, a realm that connects every world to one another. To those who know how to use its powers, it can act as a doorway between worlds. In its natural state it is the opposite of worlds, with mutable laws of physics defined by each individual and little sense of reason. Recently, however, it has become a major haven for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">Burning Legion</a>, who use it to punch holes into new worlds or intercept travelers passing through it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009">Wolfenstein</a></em> has The Black Sun Dimension, which is basically a small-ish pocket Universe being kept from collapsing by a source of unlimited power at its center, The Black Sun. The Veil is a barrier between our universe and the Black Sun dimension, through which Black Sun energy occasionally leaks in the form of energy pools. Oh, did we mention that the energy has the property of horrifically... <em>altering</em> whoever comes into contact with it, unless they use a precisely harmonized portal? There's even a sort of fauna, native to the Veil: the Geist, a species of monstrous insects that exist out-of-phase with our dimensions and can only be interacted with in the Veil... Unless you're really stupid and attract their attention, at which point all bets are off.

<ul><li> In this universe, Hyperspace is quite nice. Quasispace (Hyperspace's Hyperspace) is even nicer! But God help you if you use "Dimensional Fatigue" technology wrongly. The Androsynth tried it, and they all disappeared overnight. There are no more Androsynth, only Orz. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">Strange creatures</a> who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage">difficult to understand</a>, implied to be merely projections of some greater being from Hyperspace's or Quasispace's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a>, and will happily kill you if you persist in asking about the Androsynth.

</li><li> Also of note is the fact that Hyperspace isn't a total walk in the park; according to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">backstory</a>, the shift between dimensions causes intense nausea, much like a hyperactive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean">space seasickness</a>. The eerie background music playing while your ship travels through Quasispace really helps get the "scary place" feeling across. Some of it sounds like the screams or yells of... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">something</a>. As some of the aliens describe it, Hyperspace is "above" regular space, and Quasi-space is "above" Hyperspace. The Orz come from "below".
</li></ul></li><li> In the sequel (of disputed canonicity) to the RTS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em>, <em>Homeworld: Cataclysm</em>, the central enemy came from Hyperspace. This was a little disturbing for everyone, as until then Hyperspace has been thought to be perfectly safe (assuming you had a safe way of getting in and out of it). The Naggarok, an alien exploration vessel using an experimental form of hyperdrive, essentially went 'too deep', or something similar, resulting in it picking up a passenger in the form of a sentient biomatter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">virus</a>. Although it's worth mentioning that this explanation for how The Beast came to enter our galaxy is explicitly guesswork based on fragmentary information; all we know for certain is that the Naggarok exited hyperspace covered in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatMoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatMoss">Meat Moss</a> that had eaten most of the crew. <br/><br/>Interestingly, in an early script for <em>Homeworld 2</em>, the radiation clouds from a damaged hyperspace core were instead written as an area of space in which ships would be sucked into fiery tentacled hyperspace gates. The script describes them as "looking like they lead straight into hell". This interpretation would fit well with all the other religious symbolism in the game, but you can see why they dropped it; The radiation shields the Hiigarans eventually implement are much more believable than "portal into hell" shields.
</li><li> The first warp zone in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox1">Star Fox</a></em>, the black hole, is kind of like the warp gates in the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64">Star Fox 64</a></em>, except you can choose where to go and it's a looping level. The second one, however, sends Fox into an alternate dimension filled with grinning moons, demonic paper airplanes, classical music, and giant slot machines. This would be a zany joke level if it weren't for the fact that General Pepper asks over the intercom where Fox and his team is, and the inability to complete the level. This implies that the entire Star Fox team is trapped in an alternative dimension, flying until they either run out of fuel or are shot out of the sky, while Corneria is obliterated by Andross and his army.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elite">Elite</a></em>, a trip into hyperspace (or witch-space, as the game calls it) puts you at risk from ambush from Thargoids, who have a technology which allows them to lurk there. In some versions of the game you can force a hyperdrive failure by holding full pitch and roll while jumping, but you'd have to be either suicidal or very well armed to attempt it.
<ul><li> In <em>Frontier: Elite II</em>, mis-jumps sometimes occur, which usually just results in your ship emerging from Hyperspace too early but still with enough fuel to complete the jump. A severe mis-jump could have you emerge from Hyperspace in uncharted space thousands of light years from any inhabited system while simultaneously turning your hyperdrive into a pile of useless scrap metal. Fun.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EliteDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EliteDangerous">Elite: Dangerous</a></em> Hyperspace works in such a way that you can't judge speed or direction in it, and you pass unidentifiable cloud structures and points of light while travelling in it. You can also hear some truly bizarre sounds in it, possibly coming from the Thargoids (mentioned above). Oh, and whatever you do, <em>don't look behind you</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And in case you think it's all just atmospheric, the Thargoids can still yank you out mid-jump.</span>
</li><li> <em>The Dark Wheel</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TieInNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TieInNovel">Tie-In Novel</a> says the hyperspace lanes are protected from the two dangers of hyperspace travel. You can be turned inside out, turned into a deformed blob or sent millions of years back in time, though the latter is treated as more of an in-universe urban legend.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em>, the UMN, source of faster than light travel and communications, is also the source of the nightmarish creatures known as the Gnosis.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RebelGalaxyOutlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RebelGalaxyOutlaw">Rebel Galaxy Outlaw</a></em>, jump gates connect the solar systems of the Dodge Sector together. Unfortunately, prolonged use causes jump gates to become unstable and ultimately collapse, creating all sorts of nasty abnormalities (which has also led to a terrorist group rising up attacking any ships that use jump gates to prevent the potential destruction of the sector). You can travel through most jump gates safely, although it is never a comfortable experience. Attempting to use an unstable gate, however, can damage your ship and throw you into a completely different part of the Sector than you intended.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>, the humans and the Zuul use a specific dimension called "nodespace" to allow their ships to ignore the rules of physics. Unfortunately, nodespace is inhabited by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> known as "specters", who do <em>not</em> appreciate the intrusion and will occasionally cross over into real space and eat the population of one of your colonies to display their displeasure. The Zuul are especially at risk because of their manner of accessing nodespace: for an analogy, the spectres' annoyance at humanity would be like if you were sitting at home and someone came streaking through your living room, entering your back door and leaving through your front door — the Zuul would be the guy who entered your living room by drilling his way through the walls with a pneumatic drill, and exiting by drilling through the wall at the opposite end. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten">In the nude.</a> <br/><br/>In addition, looking directly into Node Space turns out to have really bad psychological side effects, and after a few unfortunate murder-suicides all human ships now shut all external views of their ships while performing node jumps. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kerberos-productions.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=17929&amp;view=unread#p279177">has said that Zuul find node travel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>delicious and deeply comforting</em>, like <em>burrowing into live flesh</em>.

Travel via these spells, as well as between smaller shards making up an "aethernet" covering a short distance (such as within a city), is safe. There exists, however, another teleportation spell called "Flow", which allows one to enter and exit the Lifestream at any point in the physical world — at least in theory. In practice, without aetherytes to serve as beacons, using "Flow" carries the risk of a person becoming lost in the Lifestream until their bodies and souls break down completely into aether. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even in cases where people emerge from using Flow, they rarely ever do so unscathed: Thancred was rendered completely incapable of using magic after his time in the Lifestream, and Y'shtola - who only even came back thanks to Gridanian conjurers managing to find her and pull her out of the Lifestream - was rendered blind. While she can now see aether around her to compensate, doing so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">gradually reduces her remaining lifespan</a>.</span>
<ul><li> With the introduction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">parallel worlds</a> in <em>Shadowbringers</em>, there is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds">Interdimensional Rift</a>, a dark vacuum between the Source and its reflections. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the Crystal Exarch tried to summon the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> from the Source to the First, he failed the first several times, his spell locking onto their companions and pulling their souls over, leaving their bodies in the Source comatose.

In the early days of FTL travel, technicians sometimes had to repair the drives while in mid-jump, exposing themselves to the "slipstream" and risking injury, death, or even being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">completely erased from existence</a> in the process. Even when the engine isn't operating, there's still a tendency for tools and technicians to turn up missing after a shift. Sometimes ships entering hyperspace will simply never reappear. Time dilation effects are present, which can cause unpredictable delays. It's also implied that slipspace travel has adverse effects on your health, thus the cryopods present on all UNSC vessels. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock">Thrown Out the Airlock</a> simply kicks you back into realspace, though you do get bathed in radiation in the process. Opening a slipspace rift while in an atmosphere creates a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP">EMP</a> pulse and shockwave that can knock down a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator">Space Elevator</a>. Trying to transition from realspace to slipspace when the slipspace drive isn't fully charged (at least on human ships) causes the ship to be blown into atomized bits, and even hitching a ride by following a larger ship through slipspace as the <em>In Amber Clad</em> does early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em> leaves it with several of its systems offline. Slipspace is significantly less scary for more advanced species like the Covenant and Forerunners, but even for them it can still be treacherous without the proper precautions.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em> expansion <em>Apocrypha</em> added star systems that are only accessible by wormholes and full of strange, sentient and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> machines called the Sleepers. This turned out to be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>: the players found these systems less scary than intended, mapped them, colonized them and deciphered the Sleeper A.I. to safely farm them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">Canonically</a>, just warping and jumping through stargates are mentally traumatic experiences, to the point where ship crews are either permanently juicing anti-psychotic medication to keep them sane, or else are kept sedated when they're not actually needed for anything. A capsuleer's control pod does grant them immunity to this phenomenon, but considering that it tends to drive the user insane anyway, this could be considered a mixed blessing.

<ul><li> The Halloween update in 2010 allows players to build a portal to "The Nether", a hellish underworld where every step you take translates to eight steps in the normal world (Notch explicitly compared using it for fast travel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>). Where the terrain isn't covered by lava it consists of either a red rock that readily catches on fire or a quicksand textured with <em>screaming faces</em>. The entire dimension is inhabited by herds of zombie pigmen and flying jellyfish who spit exploding fireballs that tear up the landscape and set the rock on fire.
</li><li> A later update adds another portal which leads players to another dimension called "The End", a dark world which consists entirely of a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent">Floating Continent</a> suspended over an endless void, inhabited solely by Endermen and a single Ender Dragon.
<ul><li> Notably, the End becomes a lot less scary once you realize that 1) a simple bow with a sufficient quantity of arrows will keep you safe from the Dragon as you gradually reduce his health, 2) Endermen are effectively inert if you're wearing a pumpkin or will be distracted easily by Snow Golems, 3) you can farm them in very efficient structures that'll level you from zero to level 30 in less than a minute,

Used to be, when a new Mass Relay was discovered the Citadel Council would immediately send out an explorer team to leap to the other side and map out the Relay's destination. This came to a stop however when one exploration team discovered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens">rachni</a>. The ensuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">war</a> lasted a century, which was only won when the Council employed the use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">krogan</a>, which in turn lead to Krogan Rebellions.

</div></li><li> The Web in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em>, is a bizarre and disturbing level of Cyber Space that acts as a counterpart to the organized Net. There are no apparent separate systems in the Web, it is simply a continuous flow of energy and data, resulting in constant hurricane looking storms. It can only be accessed by portals and is filled with strange monsters, not to mention exposure to the Web or its creatures <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">is corrupting</a> without protection. Nobody knows much about the place or how it works, but everyone in the Net fears it. It is the chaotic opposite of the Net and most believe that the Web would destroy the Net if a portal between the two realms was left open too long. In the season 3 finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Megabyte gets dragged into it by the Web Creature and when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">he comes back out</a> he's been twisted into an insane borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> who can mimic other sprites.</span>
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> this is applied, not to hyperspace, but to wormhole travel. During a fight a shield is damaged that protects part of a starship from the crazier aspects of wormhole travel, meaning everyone in proximity experiences a mindbending acid trip that, according to the characters, lasted "a thousand lifetimes."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: Homeworld starships travel at FTL speeds via "gravity engines". They create a gravitational singularity point (similar to a black hole) and use the massive gravitational pull to warp space-time, changing the definition of speed. The gravitational singularity is constantly created (and, presumably, evaporated in nanoseconds) in front of the ship, which basically causes it to "continuously fall" towards the singularity. It's freaky as hell; from inside the ship it basically looks like you're rocketing through a dark, multicolored void. The lighting is distorted and there's a weird 3D stereoscopic effect over everything. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityScrew">Gravity Screw</a> is so extreme that the ship has to maintain a "containment field" to protect passengers from the effects; when the field gets temporarily turned off on the ship the Crystal Gems are using, the gravity suddenly becomes so intense that Steven is pinned to his chair and has to fight with all his strength to reach the control panel. One unique aspect is regarding the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>: The bodies of Gems are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> constructs projecting from their real "bodies", the small stones located on some part of their figure. This presents an obvious problem; if the ship is going faster than light, it is therefore traveling faster than <em>the bodies of the crew</em>. The containment field isn't just there to protect against gravitational effects, it's also to make sure the the physical forms of the crew stay with the ship. When the field is turned off, their bodies lose pace with the ship and trail behind it, only "catching up" when it decelerates. According to Amethyst, experiencing this feels just as bizarre as it sounds.

We see during a flashback/dream sequence, a character from 15th-Century Europe manages to glimpse universes with spaceships, giant mechas, advanced Mayan societies and etc. However, the corridor is very fickle and it opens portals to these distant worlds at random, making very easy for them to be lost. During Season 3, one of the characters' quest is to find the corridor so they can reunite with their loved one who got lost inside it and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's revealed that a Dracula-worshiping cult is trying to open a portal to Hell so they can bring the vampire lord back to life</span>.
