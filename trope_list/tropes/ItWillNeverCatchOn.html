The Beatles were also turned down by Columbia, Pye and HMV</span>

As are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack">"prophecies"</a> uttered by people who are in a position to lose a great deal of influence, money or credibility if they are wrong.
</p><p>The best thing about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universes</a> is that they have things we can't possibly imagine being true. Why can't the reverse also fit?
</p><p>Oftentimes, be it a medieval setting or anything else where things we know about have no business existing, something abundantly familiar to our modern audience is put forth as a hypothetical. The punchline is that no one thinks it could possibly be popular, allowing us to laugh at how wrong people's predictions of the future really are, and pat ourselves on the back for being so clear-eyed.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward">Call-Forward</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldWantToWatchUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldWantToWatchUs">Who Would Want to Watch Us?</a>, which refers to the show itself, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke">Historical In Jokes</a> that re-interpret the past in terms of the show. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack">I Want My Jetpack</a>, where our present makes a wrong prediction about the future. Note that this is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as many things/people that are now legendary were considered potential failures: neither <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> nor the Beatles got good reviews when they were obscure, and many people couldn't see any use for a home computer. The polar opposite is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGoingToBeHuge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGoingToBeHuge">This Is Going to Be Huge</a>. Contrast to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise">Audience-Alienating Premise</a> for when the work sounds so strange, unique, or boring that it interests no one.

Nearly every book in print today was rejected by several other publishers, and every famous actor has been rudely dismissed from an audition at least once. This is not necessarily short-sightedness; perhaps the actor simply wasn't right for that role, or hadn't yet matured into the person we know and love today. This trope comes into play when the rejection (or begrudging acceptance) is accompanied by a blanket statement that proves to be spectacularly wrong.

Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a>, but examples of this trope are very often that as well. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">Cassandra Truth</a>, where no one believes the dissenting voices who say that some new famous or trendy product, idea or phenomenon is wrong.

</li><li> A car commercial from the late 90's was set in the 70's and featured a group of hikers waxing philosophical about what advancements would be made in 20 years. One of them comes up with the brilliant idea of bottling and selling water to make a huge profit, but his friend shoots him down, commenting that "Water is free, man!"
</li><li> The U.S. TV ad for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic and Knuckles</a></em> featured two elves lounging by the poolside at their mansion, recounting how Santa Claus had this reaction to their idea for the game's Lock-On cartridge allowing it to be combined with <em>Sonic</em> 2 and 3. So they sold the idea to Sega instead and got rich:
<div class="indent"> "Who's laughing now, FAT MAN?!"
</div></li><li> A series of radio ads for a local towing company on Vancouver Island plays with reenactments of how a call would have played out a century ago between a customer and the company. In one, the customer says, "I tell you, these trains will be running long after they stop using these new fandangled automobiles!" The trains stopped running on Vancouver Island several years ago.

In the deleted scene we find out why: it turns out he has a friend, also a filmmaker, who was telling him about his idea for a movie where humans are kept in an artificial reality by robots. He remarks that he likes his friend's design sense but thinks his movie idea is ridiculous and doomed to fail.

As a result, Molly scoffs at Arthur for using stitches as a method to try to close his venom wound that magic couldn't close. Unfortunately for him, stitches don't work either.

Ralph argues that the team's quarterback, George Blanda, is "washed up" at 30, while Richie counters that he's still got "two or three good years left". Blanda, by then aged 48 and with the Oakland Raiders, had just finished playing his 26th and final NFL season when the episode aired in January 1976.

Each has this reaction to the other's idea.
</li><li> In a flashback of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JackRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JackRyan">Jack Ryan</a></em>, we learn that the season 1 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> graduated at the top of his class in Sorbonne. In 2001, he applied for a job at a major Paris bank but was denied because the execs scoffed at the idea of online banking (and also, possibly, because he was Lebanese). Not only were the utterly wrong, but this helped start a chain of events that led to him radicalizing and becoming the next bin Laden.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Joey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Joey">Joey</a></em>, Joey is offered the lead in a show called <em>Nurses</em> about male nurses.

It's about gangs and scumbags like you roaming the country seeing who can cause the most trouble. And then we overreact, and we have to put up perimeter fences and we treat the fans like animals! Forty, fifty thousand people herded into pens! And then how long before something happens, eh?

</li><li> <em>Mad Men</em> plays this straight a lot, too, especially in its first season. Don Draper knows someone stole his research report because, "It's not like there's a magical machine out there that copies things." Sterling Cooper gets a Xerox machine next season.

<ul><li> Despite Klinger's urgings, Dr Winchester refuses to invest in commercial production of both the Hula Hoop and the Frisbee.
<ul><li> Although this was less a case of "it will never catch on" as it was Winchester being angered because he was a bit too rotund to use the hoop well and local children laughing at his attempts.
</li></ul></li><li> In another episode, Colonel Potter is writing to his wife and expresses skepticism about whether or not television will catch on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Postmodernism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Postmodernism">This is of course a throwaway line on a television show</a>.

Revolted, he demands, "Who would drink this when they could have tea?" Who indeed.
<ul><li> Even more ironic when Murdoch dismisses Crabtree's suggestions for potential applications of <em>his own inventions</em>. While Murdoch is certainly a brilliant inventor, he seems very resistant to the idea that anything he invents could ever have any effect on the world outside the police station. He even feels slightly betrayed in "Invention Convention" when he sees Crabtree showing off his past inventions (with full credit where it's due, of course) to potential investors in an effort to help him make money off his engineering genius.

</li><li> The docudrama <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PiratesOfSiliconValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PiratesOfSiliconValley">Pirates Of Silicon Valley</a></em> is chock full of these moments as everything we take for granted about personal computing is scoffed at by the executives of major computer and office equipment firms. (Things like desktop PCs, the Graphic User Interface, the mouse, etc.) In fact, Xerox PARC (the Palo Alto Research Center) is infamous for the sheer number of innovations they came up with that were discarded or dismissed by management, only to become huge successes later. "I just made a program that plays blackjack." "Why would anybody want that?"

Sharon not only went on to win Season 4, but is also one of the most popular queens to come from the show.
</li><li> When Season 5's Alyssa Edwards did poorly in a comedy challenge, she took it in stride because "America's Next Drag Superstar is not going to tour the country being a stand-up comedian." Not only was Season 5's crown won by comedic performer Jinkx Monsoon, but Season 6's Bianca Del Rio won the crown then <em>toured the country being a stand-up comedian</em>. Season 8 winner Bob the Drag Queen also incorporates stand-up comedy into her sets.
<ul><li> And now there's a touring roast featuring the stars of the show, including...Alyssa Edwards.

Then, he dismisses the whole thing with, "Naah."
</li><li> Shortly after Gillette introduced the Trac 2, a razor with two blades, SNL did a mock commercial for a three-bladed razor with the tagline "Because you'll buy anything." Soon after a three-bladed razor came out.

Grant</a>) is an avid cricket player. He delivers a bomb to a hard to reach area in the modern traditional overarm manner. A companion suggests he should try that in his cricket games as a variant to the traditional underarm bowling. He says it'll never catch on. Either method of delivery was perfectly acceptable (although underarm was phased out in the late 19th century) until the 1980s, when underarm bowling was banned. <br/><br/>This is played with in the same episode, when Percy hires a young unknown painter, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner">Joseph Turner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, to paint a landscape of his house and the surrounding gardens. Percy's friends are skeptical by the finished product, but Percy himself loves it and assures Turner that he's going to go places. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>; landscapes were relatively uncommon and it was in a large part Turner's work which elevated their status.

He feels confident but when Roland goes back to get his briefcase, he finds them all laughing at how stupid the idea is. The group is about to go only to be approached by one board member who wants to start her own firm, explaining that she's tired of watching the others ignore perfectly great business ideas. "I was in the room when they turned down Uber."

At one point he responds to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToBelieveMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToBelieveMe">outrageous claims</a> of the protagonists with "That's about as likely as me becoming Prime Minister!"
</li><li> A few examples in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> In "Time's Arrow", Data is thrown back in time to 19th Century San Francisco.

A serious example occurs in "Far Beyond the Stars", when Captain Sisko starts to hallucinate that he's a science-fiction writer in the 1950s. He submits an excellent story about a space station called Deep Space Nine, but his editor tells him to drop the idea of a Negro captain as it's "too unrealistic". However <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with a note from the editor pinned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Armin Shimerman</a>'s desk, rejecting one of his story ideas. "No-one would ever believe that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">cheerleader could kill vampires</a>."

</li><li> In "Statistical Probabilities", Bashir and some other genetically-engineered people come to the conclusion there's no way the Federation can win against the Dominion. Bashir tells Sisko that even a Cardassian-led coup couldn't turn the tide. In the epic battle of the series finale, the Cardassians suddenly turning on the Dominion is the key moment that achieves victory.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, Travis says that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy">Starfleet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward">should consider</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">putting families on starships</a>, as he grew up on a freighter and families are especially prevalent in the cargo service.

Among the concepts ridiculed by the mysterious "they": Christopher Columbus claiming the world was round, Thomas Edison's recordings, the Wright Brothers' airplane, Marconi's wireless, the creation of Rockefeller Center, Eli Whitney's cotton gin, Robert Fulton's steamboat, the Hershey bar, and the Model T Ford.

They were right, too - the only reason Columbus succeeded was dumb luck.

<ul><li> In one of her radio calls, Para-Medic pitches the idea that the future will have "movies where you control the characters yourself." She also mentioned an early VCR and the potential for "records with movie film etched onto them instead of music" — Snake is astonished at all these concepts, but doesn't consider any of them realistic. Funnily enough, critics of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> series often derisively compare the games to movies due to their unusually long cutscenes — Para-Medic thus <em>also</em> predicted one of the more common complaints about the game she's in right now.
</li><li> Another radio conversation in the game has Snake and resident weapons expert Sigint speculating the potential success of a walking, nuclear-equipped battle machine... specifically, the eponymous Metal Gear, whose designer Snake had just met and spoken to at length. Sigint thinks it's just about the stupidest thing he's ever heard, explaining in detail the flaws in the idea, and hopes the designer was joking. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Hiimdaisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Hiimdaisy">Peachi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this in her comic adaptation of <em>MGS3</em> by having Snake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">grin at the audience</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rimshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rimshot">Rimshot</a> play after this conversation.

</li><li> And another: Before the events of the game, Snake had no idea smoking was unhealthy.
</li><li> When calling Sigint about the XM16E1 rifle, Snake seems to think the addition of a three-round burst fire mode to the gun is a rather stupid idea. While his statement makes sense given the timeline (US military doctrine for firing weapons in combat at the time was, basically "you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">fire in full auto</a> or you don't fire at all"), the M16 eventually shook off most of its infamy from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> with the A2 version, which replaced the full-auto fire with a three-round burst. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">The return of a fully automatic fire mode is a much desired feature among US soldiers.</a>

<ul><li> Alex, almost word-for-word, when some island tribespeople try and teach him to surf.
</li><li> It's also uttered by the father in response to an early TV set in a "World of Tomorrow" exhibit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>: In one episode's flashback, Dr. Venture was listening about one of his dorm-mates talking about going into robotics after seeing a new film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>. Dr. Venture then tells him that there is no future in robotics, and that he might as well major in Betamax.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em>,
<ul><li> In one episode, kooky scientist Dr. Zibaldo tells the main cast about this idea he had for "radio with pictures: TELEVISION!" The main cast, of course, laughs him off. The trope is lampshaded by the iris out of the episode being a classic television test pattern. This a rather strange example, considering motion pictures existed already, and, indeed, the characters watch a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em> style film in a theater at the beginning of the very same episode, making their skepticism of moving pictures with accompanying sound rather odd.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rebecca:</strong> What an odd little man. <br/><strong>Baloo:</strong> Yeah! And what a <em>dumb</em> idea.
</div></li><li> Baloo has the same reaction when Buzz inventes the helicopter (and doesn't know whether to call it a helicopter or a Cuisinart). Ironically, Baloo is able to fly it, barely, although he also crash-lands it into Shere Khan's office. (He gets a reward for saving the day, but has to return it for a number of fines, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">parking a Cuisinart in a no-parking zone.</a> This despite the fact other episodes depict helicopters already being in existence, although they're referred to by other names ("roto-scooter" in particular).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em>
<ul><li> Muffy tries her hand at fashion design. Her chauffeur Bailey, off-hand, comes up with the idea of multicolored plastic shoes with holes in the top. Muffy says it's too ridiculous to work.
</li><li> Another episode has Arthur being dismissive of a new toy called Woogles, only for them to become a massive fad. He resists joining the bandwagon and suggests that snapping bottle caps will be a new fad. Francine is dismissive, but then bottle caps do become popular.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">The New Batman Adventures</a></em>, Killer Croc reveals a newspaper with Bruce Timm's picture on the front, along with the headline "B.T. Quotes: DVD the Next 8-Track." That's a swing and a BIG miss there.
</li><li> In the TV <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge">Ice Age</a></em>, Manny assures Sid that Christmas trees will never catch on, instead using Christmas rocks. Later, Ellie scoffs at Manny's idea of Santa Claus having a "naughty" list, which Manny himself dismisses.
<ul><li> In the Easter TV special, Manny asks what bunnies, eggs, and painting have to do with Easter.

<ul><li> There is one episode set at the time television was being recently invented. <em>Brain</em> doesn't believe it would ever replace the radios.
</li><li> Also, in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> parody, during one of those "Are you pondering what I'm pondering?" moments, Pinky ponders about a series about two lab mice trying to take over the world and wonders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldWantToWatchUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldWantToWatchUs">who'd watch that</a>.
</li><li> In another episode, desperate for a new plan, the mice ask Hollywood writers for ideas, claiming that they're making a TV show about two lab mice trying to take over the world. Naturally, some of the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">think it's a bad idea for a show</a> and suggest using the characters for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">Superhero</a> series or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarBowl">overly-saccharine</a> kiddie show.
</li><li> In an episode set during the silent film era, Brain, after an attempt to take over the world using movies, stand in front of the projector and laments "There's no way a mouse will ever have an impact on the silver screen". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrAltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrAltDisney">A man clearly meant to be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> sees Brain's silhouette on screen and sketches it down.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> parody, Brain doesn't believe the miniaturization of electronics in the lab where he and Pinky are residing will catch on, claiming that big things are the wave of the future.

</li><li> In another skit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> was meeting with a publisher over his story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRaven">The Raven</a></em>. The publisher kept wanting to make the poem more upbeat and cheerful, feeling it was too grim to be popular. Poe, not wanting his vision changed, abandoned the publisher to find other means of publishing his work, with the last words the publisher said to him was that nobody would like it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWouldFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWouldFail">You all probably know how it turned out</a>.
