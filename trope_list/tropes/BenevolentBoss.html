He often shows great respect and patience with Rachel, who suffered going through the ordeal of the <em>Flying Pussyfoot</em> hijacking, and will often criticize Nathan, another employee, whenever he either mocks Rachel or obtains/reveals information in a way that could harm innocents, and even then he is still respectful about it.
</li><li> Similarly, the Vice-President, while not as soft-spoken and understanding as his superior, is still careful to be sure not to hurt his assistant, Carol's, ego whenever correcting a mistake she has made.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>:

</li><li> Detective Superintendent Yagami in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> comes off as something of a father figure to the other task force members, or at least Matsuda.
</li><li> En from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dorohedoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dorohedoro">Dorohedoro</a></em> is one scary guy, but otherwise quite nice to his subordinates.

<ul><li> Great Demon King Piccolo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>.

He justifies it by saying that if word gets out that he is good to his subordinates, more people will want to work for him.
</li><li> Likewise, Ling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">gets dangerous</a> whenever his underlings are in danger. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It should really be no surprise when these two join forces... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbioticPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbioticPossession">so to speak</a>.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dozle Zabi of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a> and even chooses to fight beside them in the Big Zam rather than evacuate with his wife and child, despite knowing full well he won't survive the battle.
</li><li> Paptimus Scirocco of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a> with some bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> tendencies, but he is always polite and encouraging to his subordinates, even the downright losers like Jerid. When most of the other Titans officers are punching their soldiers left, right and center, it's not hard to see how Scirocco rises in power within the organization.
</li><li> Colonel Ulube Ishikawa of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> appears at first to be one of these, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> to Domon compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> Karato. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As it turns out Ulube is actually the man responsible for the Ultimate Gundam becoming the Devil Gundam, and by the end, he has succeeded Master Asia and Prime Minister Wong as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series</span>.
</li><li> Much like Dozle above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Treize Khushrenada of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> is a Father to His Men who is all-but-worshipped by his subordinates (indeed, a scheme by the Romefeller Foundation to strip him of his power backfires when his supporters launch a civil war in his name). By the end of the series, it's revealed that he can recall the precise number, <em>to the digit</em>, of the men who have died fighting for him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tsunayoshi Sawada, mostly because he sees his subordinates as his friends rather than subordinates since he doesn't actually want to be a mafia boss.
</li><li> Also Dino, to the point that he's at his strongest if his subordinates are around and he's also completely useless if they're not around. Fuuta's rankings also show that he's the #1 boss that cares about the well-being of both his subordinates and civilians.
</li></ul></li><li> Haruo Niijima <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em> who has shown from time to time to care for his subordinates, even if it meant resigning himself to certain peril.
</li><li> Nanoha Takamachi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>. She cares about her trainees. She works hard to make sure they don't overextend themselves while learning everything she can teach them. She never screams at them. She is, however, capable of blasting you into unconsciousness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">as a learning experience</a>.
</li><li> Kohta's boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBalls">My Balls</a></em> takes him out for drinks several times and one time even takes him to a brothel (the boss pays for all of it each time). Unfortunately, Kohta having sex would result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>, so all his attempts at being nice almost cause Armageddon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tsunade toward Naruto; among other things, letting him call her "Tsunade-no-baachan" (Grandma Tsunade) instead of the formal "Hokage-sama" and letting him <em>officially</em> go on missions to find Sasuke (who is officially a rogue ninja with a death penalty on his head) <em>whenever Naruto asks for it</em>.

Despite all this, job spots for his business empire always seem to be in pretty high demand, since he's always fully staffed and has no trouble finding employees. The thing about Scrooge is that he doesn't believe in luxuries for himself <em>or</em> anyone else period. So while he won't spend a cent on break rooms or heating for his employees, he presumably will pay them very well to their jobs, with the jokes about him underpaying them mainly treated as throwaway gags. One incident that stands out is from his days running the Whitehorse Bank in the Klondike when Scrooge loaned money to prospectors to use for equipment and land claims in return for half their earnings. One loaner was a smarmy business wannabee who intended to hire workers to do all the prospecting for him, rather than do ANY work himself. Scrooge promptly changed the terms of the loan so that half of the earnings would go to him, and 45% of the rest to the workers doing the actual prospecting, leaving the lazy bum taking the loan with the crumbs. <br/><br/>Some Italian stories show why his two most trusted employees, his personal secretary ms. Quackfaster and his butler Quackmore, tolerate the insane working hours (nothing more than Scrooge expects from <em>himself</em>, but still insane) and his worst moments with barely a witty remark: Ms. Quackfaster is explicitly well paid ever since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewJobEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewJobEpisode">she quit over an insane demand and found a job elsewhere</a>, only to discover she was <em>still</em> working for him indirectly and, when they both found out, Scrooge admitted the office was in chaos and got her back to the Money Bin with a raise (and toning down his stinginess); as for Quackmore, one of his duties is to test Scrooge's new <em>luxury goods</em>, and, being allowed to keep them afterwards, once his job is done for the day he lives like a billionaire, complete with his own robotic butler.

You don't <em>give</em> me anything, I don't <em>give</em> you anything, we both hold our heads up." Seeing that Devlin's family is in dire financial straits, he then gives his friend Drago some money to give to Devlin, saying, "Tell him I pay my men a month in advance." Throughout the movie, he treats his employees fairly and is friendly to them, especially Devlin whom he learns to respect as a fine young man and hard worker; when Devlin and McLintock's daughter Becky announce their engagement toward the end of the movie, he's overjoyed.

Thrawn's XO Pellaeon notes immediately afterward that the crew of the <em>Chimera</em> had respected Thrawn before, but now they'd die for him.

He's generous, friendly, and works as hard as, if not harder than, anyone. He appreciates his employees and goes along with all of Felicity's quirks, such as her taking two different - highly suspicious sounding — calls while she's in a meeting with him. He also lets her take a sick day to spend time with her mom, even though he knows full well that she's fine.
</li></ul><ul><li> Cam Saroyan on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>, pretty much. She's professional at work but is still pretty engaged with the lab team at the same time. Goodman wasn't *too* bad, but he was more stern than Cam.
</li><li> Paul Lewiston of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal">Boston Legal</a></em> may be the frustrated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> in a firm made up of gun-toting, sex-addicted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster">filibustering</a>, cross-dressing, midget-fetishising <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny Ears Lawyers</a>, but he still manages to put up with them all.

Every assistant or secretary he's had went away better for having been hired.
</li></ul></li><li> Gus Fring in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> is a tough but fair boss. He embodies the trope to the employees of his legitimate businesses, and to his drug empire employees so long as they follow his orders and don't compromise themselves, to the point that he set up offshore bank accounts in the names of his associates to make sure their families were taken care of in the event of his death. Gus sours on Walt when Walt starts to become a liability.
<ul><li> On the legal side of his business, Fring also treats the working-class employees of his Los Pollos Hermanos front restaurants with respect. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul">Better Call Saul</a></em>, when his cartel bosses take his employees hostage to intimidate him into a meeting, Fring first dismisses them for the day, promising to compensate them for the missed shift. The next day, he apologizes to them personally, arranges for an extra two days worth of pay for the trouble, and offers to pay for counseling for the employees if needed.

He's always got a kind word, he asks after your family, he encourages good dental hygiene and good nutrition, and he discourages swearing and encourages teamwork and esprit de corps. He'll even pay for a new wardrobe and an apartment if you happen to be a homeless psychotic slayer in need of an outlet for your violent tendencies! Oh, and he wants to transform into a giant snake demon and eat everyone in the city. But what boss is perfect, right?
</li></ul><ul><li> Sam Malone from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> is a benevolent boss during the seasons when he owns the bar. He helps Carla out financially when she's pregnant for the fifth time, drives her to the hospital to give birth, lets her breastfeed in his office, accompanies her to her ex-husband's wedding, never bugs her about being late, etc. Before and after dating Diane, he was shown to be very attentive to her as well — comforting her when her cat died, for example. Also, although he romantically pursues more than one waitress, it's absolutely clear that their employment does not depend on being friendly to his advances.
</li><li> Rube in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> who keeps his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits">Rag Tag Bunch Of Misfits</a> running about as tight a ship as can be reasonably expected.

</li><li> Adelle DeWitt from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em> is an odd example — her general persona is of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">Ice Queen</a>, a tough, non-nonsense businesswoman, and in her particular line of work she is even willing to <em>kill</em> if necessary... but she also cares about her employees, and they know it.

One of the things that makes him such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> is that he genuinely appreciates good work and makes sure it is rewarded, which results in loyal, hard-working mooks who can't easily be swayed by the good guys or poached by rival baddies. At one point, he deliberately sent one of his senior minions to a horrible death to punish him for having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a> attitude to the mooks.

There is some truth to it since it's shown they do miss him while working for Qyburn.

He holds his subordinates to a high standard of professionalism and integrity and doesn't hesitate to tear strips off them if they screw up, but as long as they do good work he'll gladly go to bat for them when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Chief Daniels</a> is looking for a scapegoat.

And considering all that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Raylan's</a> put the Lexington office through, should probably be considered for sainthood.
</li></ul><ul><li> Jimmy James from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a></em>. He loves to mess with his underlings but in the end, is always looking out for them.

Michael comes closest, even having moments where he actually is helpful. (Supporting Pam after her failed art gallery show, for instance.) David, on the other hand, gets <em>extremely</em> angry and defensive when his "advice" is rejected or disputed. After Michael left the US version, Andy Bernard started out as one of these. Although it is quite clear that he is new to management, he is still relatively reasonable and kind to the employees and is arguably more competent as a boss than as a salesman.
</li><li> Admiral Malkor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">Power Rangers Megaforce</a></em>. Yes, he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and not exactly <em>nice</em>, but unlike previous villains, he treats his subordinates with true respect and as equals. In fact, the worst thing he does towards them is scold them if they fail him too many times or if they fall before their enemies in battle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval">Primeval</a></em>, Lester is really a fairly Benevolent Boss hiding behind a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold">Hidden Heart of Gold</a>. However it is clear when he offers to let a temporarily homeless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Connor</a> stay at his place, and after he was forced to undergo a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">10-Minute Retirement</a> his return is greeted with a standing ovation from the rest of the ARC staff, that he is at most a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> (and awesome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>).

He believes the workforce should feel like a family and encourages his workers to express how close they are and try to be closer, invites higher-level workers to his daughter's wedding, praises good work publicly, and so on.

Considering all the crap he had to deal with the Vulcans and all the trouble Archer got into, he did a really good job.
</li><li> In most of the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> series, most of the Ranger teams were special military task forces led by a commander. Most of the time, said commanders fell into this trope. To list them all would make this list very long. Later <em>Sentai</em> series stepped away from having a superior commander. If the Rangers do have a superior, he or she acts more as a mentor rather than a superior. Also, despite being known for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a>, the franchise has a fair share of Benevolent Bosses on the villain's side:
<ul><li> Witch Bandora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger">Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger</a></em> is rather benevolent for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Her villainous group comes across more as a family than a boss with subordinates, with her taking on a rather motherly role. She compliments her subordinates when they do something right and at most hits them on the head with her wand when they mess up.
</li><li> Doctor Hinelar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenjiSentaiMegaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenjiSentaiMegaranger">Denji Sentai Megaranger</a></em> is this to his minions Shiborena and Yugande. Justified, because Shiborena is created as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a> for his deceased daughter, while it is implied Yugande is like a son to him. When Yugande was being used as a living shield by Gurail, Hinelar went as far as to poison Gurail, causing him to lose his mind.

<ul><li> Leo McGarry as well, excepting Season 5.

</li><li> Of the various Baltimore Police Department commanders, Howard "Bunny" Colvin is one of the few who are willing to solve problems and help underlings in need. Best shown when he delivers some compassionate criticism to Carver, which has a positive impact on Carver's career and helps him to become a caring public servant.

Lester Freamon makes the point that his non-intrusive, hands-off approach allows actual police work from the professionals.
</li><li> Raymond Foerster is one. At Foerster's wake in season 4, Landsman says that Foerster spent 39 years in the BPD "without leaving a trace of bitterness or hatred with any officers, a miraculous career by BPD standards".
</li><li> Jay Landsman appears aloof, but he truly does care about his subordinates, from lobbying Rawls on McNulty's behalf (although this partially comes from Jay's desire to keep the clearances that McNulty brings in), administering Irish wakes for fallen officers, and cutting Bubbles loose after Sherrod's overdose.
</li><li> Though the ruthless leader of a drug crew, Avon Barksdale has moments like this, from letting Cutty leave the organization on his own terms, and later providing funding for Cutty's boxing gym.
</li><li> Tragically deconstructed with Frank Sobotka. While he takes good care of his fellow dockworkers and all of his schemes are for their benefit, he's so busy being a father to the union guys that he was never properly a dad to his own son. It also turns out that the union guys are willing to make a doomed moral gesture after his death and declare their loyalty to him despite the government warning that the union will be decertified unless they select new leadership.

In one instance in Season Three when Tatiana gets drunk and gets increasingly crazy with her antics, in the middle of the night she starts trying to wake up the household, orders a maid to light a fire and then wants her to watch them have sex - Tommy instantly shuts this down despite needing intel Tatiana has and thus it's high priority to appease her, but he insists to the maid to go back to bed and ignore what's happening. In another instance he barely bats an eyelid when he walks in on Johnny Dogs having sex with one of his maids and when she starts apologising profusely, he casually assures her he isn't going to fire her.

</li><li> Speaking of Fawful, he himself is this to his right-hand man, Midbus. A large spiny pig, this brute serves as the brawn to Fawful's brain and matches strength with Bowser. Fawful is kind and respectful to Midbus and in turn, Midbus is completely loyal.
<ul><li> Best seen in Midbus' last battle. Fawful is uneasy and considers joining the battle out of concern for Midbus. However, he decides to let Midbus go at it alone out of respect for the pig's pride, but not before using a ray gun to give Midbus some extra power and even ice abilities.
</li></ul></li><li> Count Bleck from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">surprisingly nice</a> for someone having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalCosmicTemperTantrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalCosmicTemperTantrum">Suicidal Cosmic Temper Tantrum</a>.

In his will, he gave his maid Elizabeth his personal estate and his tracker Barnabus Hale his business empire. He gave his sons a worthless piece of land to fight over.

While Archimonde in most cases would instantly kill an underling who failed a mission, Kil'Jaeden is more than willing to give second chances, especially if it's not the underling's fault, and will only exterminate the poor mook if he is a complete failure. That's pretty damn decent for someone who is the temporary replacement for the whole franchise's currently missing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and thus one of the most powerful and evil beings in the universe, barring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sargeras</a> himself and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Old Gods</a>.

He's a legend among the Sotenbori night lift, with both his workers at The Grand and Club Sunshine praising him for being kind, gentle, and highly business savvy. When working with other yakuza in criminal enterprises, on the other hand, Majima is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> who will threaten his underlings to get results, and will beat the crap out of them if he's feeling bored.

George is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> that nobody in the store likes, while Brian is a cheerful and upbeat guy who is naturally likable.

After having legally bought Disney, his Nazi forces start to occupy the Disney universe, with Goebbels being put in charge of the occupation. What makes Hitler a benevolent boss, is that he wants the Disney characters to become full-fledged German citizens and actually listens to the complaints of his generals about Goebbels' abusive treatment of the Disney characters. As a result, he makes clear he'll elect a replacement leader for Disney as soon as he can.

<ul><li> Iroh is a good candidate for this trope. He withdrew his troops from a two-year-long siege of Ba Sing Se when he realized that it was pretty much hopeless (granted, it took the death of his only son to see this...), and he acts more or less like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">voice of reason</a> to the troops under Zuko's command during his exile.

When the boys accidentally get Scrooge's butler Duckworth fired, they apologize and tell him they'll miss him but still think any job "is better than being Uncle Scrooge's slave"; Duckworth says indignantly, "I love serving Mr. McDuck!" And when Scrooge goes looking for three cargo ships of his that have disappeared, he finds his crews being held prisoner (along with many others) on a bizarre seaweed island. Scrooge's captain tells him how hearing that he had arrived made them all feel hope for the first time in years, and they all had faith that, with him leading the way, they could escape (Scrooge doesn't let them down). Employees of McDuck Enterprises all seem to consider their boss benevolent, even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a>.

After the twins scare the Gremoblin away, Mabel ends up snapping at Soos and Wendy after the two try to get out of fixing the damage done to the Mystery Shack, and she ends up barking orders like Stan to get things done.

</li><li> Pops from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> falls into this trope. He's the son of the owner of the park and is technically higher-ranked than everyone else, but he rarely asserts his authority, usually lets Benson run things, and acts more like a regular employee. However, on the rare occasion he does act like an actual boss, he's a very compassionate one. When he becomes concerned with Benson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBoss">Mean Boss</a> tendencies, he sits Benson down in his office and explains to him calmly and gently to stop yelling at his employees and to work on managing his anger. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This turns out to be a bad idea, as forcing Benson to hold in his anger nearly <em>destroys the world</em>.</span>

He even went so far as to give Homer the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denver">Denver</a> Broncos as a going-away present. (Homer had really wanted to own the Dallas Cowboys, but while Scorpio couldn't get them, he was the only one who ever told him that his dream to own them wasn't crazy.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, Mr. Burns can play the trope straight, albeit on very, <em>very</em> rare occasions.
</li><li> Smithers once attempted to become this after briefly being placed as Burns' temporary replacement after Burns was arrested for a theft of paintings, but after Homer, Lenny and Carl started mocking him behind his back about his allowing them to essentially goof off... well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">you get the picture</a>.
</li><li> Homer himself played it quite straight when he became CEO and overthrew Mr. Burns until he realized that he was missing out on his family and gave up the position. (Burns has a seemingly heartfelt conversation with Homer about the time running the plant costs someone, only to hit him with a tranq dart and attempt to wall him up in a mausoleum. Being as frail as he is, he's barely finished a row of bricks by the time Homer wakes up. The bemused Homer puts a blanket on Burns's shoulders and walks off while Burns continues to add bricks.)
</li><li> Another example is when Homer is put in charge of the Nuclear plant outsource in India. Mostly we see his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">megalomaniac behavior</a> after a few silly comments and a fortune cookie, but it turns out in the end that the worshipful behavior from the employees is due to him giving them all the benefits typical to American workers, but denied outsourced labor, such as unions, vacation time and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> severance pay, to Burns's dismay</span>. Their chanting while cheering him on translates to union slogans
</li><li> The German bosses in the episode 'Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk' are far more personable and kindly than Burns ever was. They offer rehabilitation to all alcoholic employees and keep on every single employee except for Homer. They only fire Homer because his ineptitude as Safety Inspector was endangering every other person at the plant. This backfires when the plant which they bought for $100 million would cost another $100 million to be brought up to code, and they end up with no choice but to desperately sell the plant back to Mr. Burns, who buys the plant back at $50 million, minus the upgrading costs.

He rewards genuine effort and competence with promotion, patches over shaky loyalty with favoritism, punishes complacent attitudes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> behavior with demotion, and only berates his minions when they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">refuse to acknowledge their mistakes</a>. He also doesn't try to micromanage his subordinates, giving them more latitude to act and even officially authorizing their actions if those actions benefit the Horde.

</li><li> Rebecca Cunningham from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em> usually leans towards this, generally treating her employees more as friends and has yet to fire one despite their numerous acts of stupidity. That said, due to having slight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> tendencies and a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">erratic personality</a>, she can have shades of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBoss">Mean Boss</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a> at times (especially in early episodes).
</li><li> Breakdown of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> is a villainous example. He's an antagonist, but he tells his subordinates to keep up the good work and that he understands the job the Vehicons were doing can be thankless. Considering Decepticon M.O. is usually that the best you can hope for is barked orders and that your superiors <em>only</em> threaten you for incompetence, that's a step up.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> was said to treat some of its employees incredibly well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> released two articles on the subject (seen <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_21914_6-hidden-sides-disneyland-only-employees-get-to-see.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_21011_6-things-nobody-tells-you-about-working-at-disney-world.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), in which employees discuss the bosses giving cast members lots of freedom to keep the guests happy. The bosses also threw the cast members impromptu parties with free food, even providing them benefits out of the blue. The turnover rate in the parks was once extremely low, and cast members were reported to be very happy with their jobs.
<ul><li> Although in recent years, employees have been <a class="urllink" href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-dreier-flaming-disneyland-employee-survey-20180228-story.html">undervalued, disrespected and underpaid.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> A 2018 survey found that most struggle to keep a roof over their heads and cannot afford proper healthcare because the company cares more about making a quick buck.
<ul><li> For her part, Abigail Disney (Roy O. Disney's granddaughter) <a class="urllink" href="https://insidethemagic.net/2019/07/abigail-disney-disneyland-ba1/">was incensed at the conditions at Disneyland<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<div class="indent"><em>I was so livid when I came out of there because, you know, my grandfather taught me to revere these people that take your tickets, that pour your soda, she continued. Those people are much of the recipe for success.</em>

As a result, he was very popular, and men were often eager to join his crew.
</li><li> Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, owner of association football club <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague">Leicester City</a>, overseeing their logic-defying run to the Premier League title in 2015/16. He was widely beloved by everyone from the first team (who referred to him as 'the Boss') down, defying the stereotype of the detached owner, instead coming off as a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>. He even remained on good terms with Claudio Ranieri, title-winning manager (coach) who he'd sacked on the grounds that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingPersonal">Nothing Personal</a> (Ranieri's tactics were no longer working, and Leicester were at risk of dropping out of the division). When he died in a helicopter crash after a Leicester City home match, goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was one of the first on the scene, seen sprinting towards the burning wreckage with complete disregard for his own safety, and Leicester's first team squad were seen in tears at the funeral in his native Thailand. Ranieri also attended, both the funeral and the memorial service in England, being one of the first to lay flowers. More generally, his death was greeted with widespread mourning across English football.
</li><li> In 2011, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">3DS</a> wasn't selling well enough, then-president <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata">Satoru Iwata</a> cut his own salary in half rather than lay off any workers to keep company morale high.

</li><li> By all contemporary accounts, Milton S. Hershey was an affable and honest businessman who took workplace safety and improving the living conditions of his employees very seriously, to the point where he considered employees' well being a higher priority than expansion. The only other responsibility for which he reserved the same level of priority was, reportedly, producing good quality chocolate.
</li><li> By all accounts, Lawrence Welk was this to his musical family, albeit one not to be trifled with, if Cissy King's account of her departure from his syndicated variety show in late 1978/early 1979 is anything to go by.
</li><li> Besides gaining a reputation for durable and stylish footwear, the Filipino shoe brand Ang Tibay (lit. So Durable or It's Durable) was also lauded for the company's treatment of its employees. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/modern-living/2002/04/20/157909/way-we-wore">According to one article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, company founder Teodoro Toribio spared no expense at looking after his workers as not only was the work facilities at his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtDeco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtDeco">Art Deco</a>-inspired factory well-lit and ventilated, Toribio had recreational facilities installed such as an employee lounge and even a bowling alley (decades before such facilities became common in companies such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> among others), and provided housing near the factory premises. It helps that Toribio lived a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">Rags to Riches</a> story himself, knowing how it felt like to be impoverished and thus gave back to those who have been in the same situation as he was prior to his success.
