<ul><li> Attempts at reviving dead people with alchemy creates a badly-constructed human body made from chemical elements. This body, which has no soul or consciousness and only the most rudimentary of biological functions, usually expires within moments of its 'birth'. One alchemist in a bonus chapter managed to create a body that was capable of maintaining biological functions... but all it could do was sit there, with brain functions barely above a vegetative state. And while the characters believed there was a soul in the body, there's no way of telling whether it was the soul of the dead person the alchemist was trying to revive, or just some other random soul.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a>, however, attempts at reviving dead people with alchemy create homunculi. Homunculi are beings with the same chemical makeup and appearance as the human that was supposed to be resurrected, but they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoulless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoulless">no souls</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">conscience</a>. As a result of having no soul they cannot perform alchemy, but instead have a single alchemy-related super power. Many of the homunculi are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaTestBaddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaTestBaddie">Beta Test Baddies</a> who have thrown their lot in with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> for the promise of a soul.
</li><li> The manga ultimately subverts the trope, in that the "revived" people are entirely different beings. (Trisha's hair was brown, the body the Elrics created had black hair, etc.) This revelation leads Ed to conclude reviving the dead is impossible and relieves Alphonse and Izumi Curtis, who had been suffering immense grief over killing their loved ones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">again</a> with failed transmutations.

</li><li> A milder example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a>: City of the Dead</em>. Inject a rotting corpse with the reanimation serum, get a rotting clumsy zombie. Fresher corpses produce more useful zombies. The <em>freshest</em> ones - like, say, someone an inquiring scientist has just murdered - come back with some of their old ability to speak and remember, but still obedient. Zak Arranda, finding his new friend Kairn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild">turned into a zombie</a> in such a fresh way, thinks he's changed - he's more morbid, can't seem to follow a conversation very well, and oh yes he helps the scientist capture Zak. Said scientist injects himself while still alive. When he's killed, he comes back <em>right</em>, the only negative effect that seen being a periodic uncontrollable spasming. <em>Kairn</em> didn't come back right, exactly, but enough of him remains that when Zak appeals to him for help, he's able to struggle against the scientist's control and help his friend.

His revived body is distorted and disfigured, and his soul is damaged, but these are due to a separate bit of dark magic and it is later seen in a flashback that he was gradually deformed long before the physical reincarnation. Later it is also revealed that he was never really dead: his soul stayed alive because he had anchored it in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Horcruxes</a>, even though his body died when his own curse was reflected.

His first revived human attempts to claw its way back into its filled-in grave, and the others exhibit similar signs of madness when revived. Finally, the abominations that West hauled back from the great beyond find him, and silently tear him to pieces in front of the narrator, before leaving without a trace with West's remains. The last one of West's experiments does appear to be quite sentient: a pilot decapitated in an accident, whose head and body live separate from each other but act as one entity. He is not only able to understand what West did to him (having helped with a few experiments himself) and desire revenge, but also bend the other research subjects to his will, as well.

However, she is languid, appears ill and exhausted and does not demonstrate any pleasure in life or happiness that she is alive again. She also often speaks nonsense due to a spell that prevents her from telling anyone the truth about her condition and the implications of the deal, which mean she is taken into Faerie every night and forced to attend balls and dance all night long.

The first wish is for a pile of money, which they get as compensation for the horrific death of their son. The second wish, made in a rash moment of extreme grief, is for their son to come back. The father quickly realizes this trope will be in effect given the way the first wish came about (the son was said to have been brutally mangled in the machinery of the plant he was working at, and the second wish never specified for him to come back unmaimed). The audience/reader never actually sees <em>what</em> comes back, because just as the mother is about to open the door and let their "son" in, her husband uses the third and final wish to undo the second one and she finds nothing and no-one there.
</li><li> The basic premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PetSematary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PetSematary">Pet Sematary</a></em> is that what you bring back is not what first died.

The plot revolves around Tael Riverine from the (chronologically) most recent trilogy, who is still fixated on making her his bride. She's been gone, but the protagonists try to retrieve her from her new existence in the belief that she can help stop Riverine. The ancient being that allowed her to ascend grants her return to humanity, but not quite as the protagonists wanted... Tragic especially because she had wanted to be free from the doubt and pain of human life, only to be dragged back again to finish her unfinished business.

Downplayed in that he's 100% obedient to the throne, and never speaks, and is thus a far less despicable person than the complete psychopath Gregor Clegane was. On the other hand, however, it's very heavily implied that he doesn't have a head, sooo yeah...

Roshag's soul was enslaved by the Sleepers, omnicidal powers from beyond the world. Their power forced Roshag back into his decomposed remains, to return as their Harbringer, a blighted abomination. Roshag is now driven by revenge unto that human, and doesn't mind becoming an undead monstrosity as much as becoming enslaved.
</li><li> The necromancer Lord Markus of Tlantos intended to take over the body of his subordinate necromancer Chismar - in the case that his own body was killed - through the Soul Bridge spell placed on said subordinate. As Chismar was killed before Markus, the Soul Bridge forced Markus' soul into the corpse, creating a lich. Note that in this setting a lich is an omnicidal manifestation of supercharged necromancy and becoming one is a disgrace.

<ul><li> Demise. After drawing the Black Queen, Demise was treated with the experimental Trump cure. It seemed to work, as he survived, retaining his human shape, sanity, memory and personality, thus not fitting any of the 5 subtropes above. Demise also gained absolute regeneration, thus becoming an Ace. The only problem was apparently being conscious during death and aware of the entire process, requiring massive therapy afterwards. Now Demise can, upon locking eyes, telepathically project memories of death, which can shock, stun or kill the recipient depending on the dose.
</li><li> Crypt Kicker. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Wild Card</a> kicked in as he went postal, at the moment he shot himself. Crypt Kicker has kept the human shape, (debatable) sanity, personality and memory, thus not fitting any of the subtropes above, and gained the Ace ability to excrete unspecified caustics and toxins from his palms. While technically immortal, he has no regenerative abilities, gradually losing parts through the books, until someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">releases him from the mortal coil</a>.
</li><li> After killing a man, Fortunato uses his Tantric Magic-style powers to bring the man back to life. The man gets back up, a haunted expression on his face as if he had seen Something Man Was Not Meant To Know, utters one word, "Tiamat", and immediately tears out his own throat.

One Cylon, Number 3, even found it "rejuvenating". However, a Number 1 described the process as a white hot poker being driven into his skull. Another 1 mentions that the process is more unpleasant each time he does it, although it is apparently less unpleasant than healing up normally after severe injury.

<ul><li> It becomes a major plot point in season 6. When Buffy behaves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OocIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OocIsSeriousBusiness">erratically and out of character</a> after her resurrection, Spike attempts to convince her that she's lost something in her return to Earth, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aided by the fact that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">inhibitor chip</a> doesn't work on her, enabling him to injure Buffy in a fight — and during their increasingly violent sexual encounters</span>. When Tara reassures Buffy that, while she's molecularly a bit different ("same Buffy, with a deep tropical cellular tan"), she <em>didn't</em> come back wrong, it actually makes things <em>worse</em>, as Buffy had been hoping there was an external reason for her recent odd and self-destructive behavior rather than her own severe depression since returning.
<ul><li> Buffy herself was convinced she was thrown out of Heaven, and didn't bring this up with the others when they brought her back; as far as they know, they'd brought her back from some deeper part of hell she didn't want to talk about. This makes it all the more heart-wrenching when a musical demon forces them all to tell their truth in song, and Buffy tells them all where she had actually been and what she thought of her resurrection.
</li></ul></li><li> Earlier in Season 5, this trope also appears in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS5E17Forever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS5E17Forever">Forever</a>", when Buffy and Dawn's mother dies, Dawn makes her first venture into witchcraft, invoking a spell to bring their mother back. Buffy is furious at Dawn; witchcraft can produce horrific results, especially when done by amateurs. Dawn is obstinate, accusing Buffy of not even understanding how much she misses their mom  until their mother's silhouette appears outside their window. Suddenly Buffy, who has been trying to be strong for her sister this whole time, breaks down and rushes to the door, yearning to see her mother again. At the same moment, Dawn realizes how much Buffy has also been suffering and that she isn't as alone in her grief and loss as she thought. Dawn revokes the spell, and whatever was on the other side of the door disappears before Buffy can open it. We never learn whether or not Joyce Summers came back wrong. Considering Dawn got the spell from a guy later revealed to be an ally (possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Glory</a>, odds are it was probably <em>designed</em> to make the person it was used on come back wrong.

<div class="indent"><strong>Buffy:</strong> Well, Ive got a news flash for you, brain trust. Thats not how it works. You die, and a demon sets up shop in your old house, and it walks, and it talks, and it remembers your life, but its not you.

To his horror, the vampire version of his mother taunts him cruelly and makes incestuous advances toward him. He immediately stakes her.
</li><li> Considering later examples it's interesting that when Buffy dies for the first time in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS1E12ProphecyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS1E12ProphecyGirl">Prophecy Girl</a>" (she was only mostly dead) there aren't any major ramifications. Well, aside from the aforementioned disruption in the cycle leading to there being two slayers from then on. Justified in that it wasn't a magical resurrection but CPR that started her heart beating again before brain death due to lack of oxygen.
</li><li> In Season 9, Eyghon, the demon summoned by Giles and Ethan in their youth, returned and possessed Ethan's body to literally snatch Giles' corpse at his funeral. Eyghon now possesses Giles and has resurrected a recently deceased slayer as well as other people, though not with their own souls as the bodies are possessed by demons.

This trope is played straight, however, when Sabrina attempts to bring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her boyfriend's dead brother</span> back to life after he is murdered by other witches; he returns as a mute, semi-conscious shell with only the most basic reflexes and instincts, and he is on the path to murderous cannibalism when he is given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS02E04ChildrenShouldntPlayWithDeadThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS02E04ChildrenShouldntPlayWithDeadThings">"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things" (S02, E04)</a>, a college student-turned-necromancer brings back a woman on whom he had a crush. She is, of course, a vengeful bloodthirsty zombie. Dean even outright says "What's dead should stay dead", and he obviously thinks this applies to himself as well as the zombie because of the deal his father made three episodes earlier so Dean wouldn't die.
</li><li> Dean even lampshades it when Bobby's wife returns from the dead apparently normal. Dean, not clouded by emotions, proves to be right.
</li><li> Also pointed out by Yellow Eyes after Dean makes a deal to bring Sam back to life—he asks Dean if he thinks that maybe the deal sounded too good to be true and if Sam's possibly been brought back...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself">different</a>.
<ul><li> Notably subverted this one time when Sam came back: although he did seem to act darker at first after being revived, it turned out that he was actually attempting to toughen himself up to carry on as a hunter after Dean died in a year from the deal to bring Sam back.
</li></ul></li><li> The second (well, technically third, but the second big one) time Sam came back, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoullessShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoullessShell">he was definitely wrong</a>. This mainly happened because his soul was unreachable (trapped in Lucifer's Cage), but it probably didn't help that Cas was too distracted with the angelic civil war to double-check his work.
</li><li> A recurring theme in seasons 6 and 7 was that while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">death might be cheap</a> in the <em>Supernatural</em> universe, everything comes back wrong, including Sam, Dean, and Castiel. Even if your soul is fully intact, you'll end up causing destruction and cursing the people around you. Dean's resurrection (after he began torturing souls in Hell) broke the first seal, Sam's (both of them in different ways) eventually resulted in Armageddon, and poor Cas accidentally wiped out his entire (or almost) species by turning them into Leviathan chow. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient">Littlest Cancer Patient</a> accidentally killed a nurse because her soul wasn't reaped in time.
</li><li> Both Cain and Dean were resurrected after death by the power of the Mark of Cain, but as a Demon, specifically a Knight of Hell.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is the impetus for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em>: after being killed by Daleks in <em>Doctor Who</em>, Jack Came Back Wrong and subsequently took charge of Torchwood 3 (Cardiff). Also happens more than once to other characters, thanks to the resurrection gauntlet. Both Suzie Costello and Owen Harper are brought back from the dead with some interesting, but different, side effects: Suzie drains Gwen to become permanently alive and Owen comes back with Death, but he gets better... kinda.

In the end, he lights a cigarette with his mind.
</li></ul><ul><li> In an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> episode with an honest-to-goodness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWishes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWishes">Three Wishes</a> genie, the first master wishes to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">invisible</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">gets killed by a car when trying to cross the street.</a> When his brother wishes for him to come back alive, he appears as a shivering necrotic corpse, unable to speak. His brother wishes for him to be able to talk in spite of the genie's warning, and he screams for minutes straight. After he's all screamed out, he attempts to light the stove to warm himself, complaining he "can't feel his blood." He fumbles the matches with the gas on full blast for many minutes, and when he finally does light one the trailer explodes, killing both brothers (we hope) permanently and ejecting the genie. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>.

</li><li> Discussed and averted in the Gospel of John of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, chapter 11. When Jesus proceeds to resurrect Lazarus, his sister Martha tells Jesus in verse 39 that she is worried that it has been four days since he died, meaning that at this point of time, his body would stink and begin to rot. Jesus then responds by reminding those at Lazarus' tomb that he is the Resurrection and the Life, before calling to his Father to raise Lazarus from the dead. Fortunately, Lazarus then emerges from the tomb alive and well, apparently no worse for the wear after his grave clothes were unwrapped.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica">Ars Magica</a></em>, a game where one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">hard and fast rules</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Hermetic Magic</a> is that it can't bring back the dead, there <em>is</em> a spell that can bring back the dead... sort of. But you have to roll on a table to see what goes wrong (not <em>if</em> something goes wrong — something always goes wrong.) The results can include almost any of the things named above, except that the original soul can never return — the 'best' possibility is a facsimile with the memories and personality of the original person, but without the ability to learn anything new. You're far more likely to get an emotionless automaton or a possessed body, though.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em> has lots of ways to come back, almost all of them fulfilling this trope. ANY player character who dies may come back as a walking corpse with a demon using their head as a time-share. Players came to expect this trope so much that when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectibleCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectibleCardGame">Collectible Card Game</a> offered the resurrection of a dead character as a tournament prize, the writers made it clear that it would avert this trope and be an honest-to-God divine intervention - which in <em>Deadlands</em> is the ONLY way to come back "right."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 3.5 edition spell Reincarnation has a good chance of bringing the reincarnated character back as something other than what they were before. The consequences of bringing an elf back as a dwarf (or vice versa) would be quite silly, though. This has also been used to create horror, such as when the elf is reincarnated as an orc or a bugbear or something else which is simply terrifying to them.
</li><li> Earlier editions had a fair number of animals on the list. The elf might come back as a badger. The old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> setting actually has a group whose special abilities include having Reincarnation guaranteed to at least give you a player character race.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> has the same spell, though a more player-friendly version of it. This is unsurprising, as <em>Pathfinder</em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> of D&amp;D 3.75, and over time each edition of <em>D&amp;D</em> after <em>AD&amp;D</em> has been less cruel to the player characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> exploits Came Back Wrong on every resurrection spell, with the recipient of the spell having a very good chance of being possessed by something suitably blasphemous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>, due to the orbital movements of the planes, sets the reliability of any spell that brings back the dead by the proximity of the plane of death. When Dolurrh is furthest from Eberron those spells don't work at all, at its closest point the resurrectee has a chance of being brought back with someone else's soul or possessed by a demon, or accompanied by a horde of ghosts.
</li><li> 3.5 book <em>Heroes of Horror</em> recommended this as an optional rule to inject some extra horror into the world, while also making the players less likely to rush through the afterlife's revolving door.
</li><li> Some planes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> risk this if you try to resurrect someone while on them. Particularly in the Abyss, you were likely to end up with a demonic spirit inhabiting the body instead.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> is impossible (save via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">Reincarnation</a>). The Liminal Exalted, introduced in Third Edition, are what occurs when someone tries (in spite of that rule) to either bring back the dead or breathe new life into dead flesh, and attracts the attention of an entity in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld">The Underworld</a>, which creates the Liminal. Though the being produced may have some of the memories of the person(s) whose body they were created from, they are secondhand experiences, like scenes from a movie, and the original person's soul is <em>not</em> what guides the Liminal.
</li><li> While many cards have handled this theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, mostly Black and mostly involving selfish necromancers raising the dead as mindless servants, this is the defining attribute of The Returned, the chief Black society in the <em>Theros</em> expansion. Returning from the underworld is no small feat, and those doing so for themselves are forced to give up their personalities and identities as toll. Those who Return are <em>not</em> human; They bear only brief flickers of their old memories and cannot form new ones. They have dark bluish-grey skin and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank">no face</a>, wearing a golden mask to hide this. (gold being the most abundant metal in the Underworld due to all the coins entombed with the newly dead as a funeral rite) And just to add insult to injury, the face on a Returned's mask isn't even theirs, because they willfully gave up every aspect of their old identity when they returned, and even if they die again <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">they can never reclaim who they once were.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>, when people get stuffed with too many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul">artificial implants</a>, they die. This can be averted by having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">magician</a> go on a journey to what may or may not be the afterlife in order to bind your soul and force it back into what's left of your body when you cross that threshold of having too much good stuff in your body. On the plus side, you get to avoid the normal limitations on having useful cybernetics, and you become a semi-magical creature to boot. Too bad that you constantly find yourself detaching from the world around you as your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagedSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagedSoul">soul</a> keeps on thinking that your body is dead and tries to <em>leave</em>. You constantly pollute the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld">astral space</a> around you with the sheer <em>wrongness</em> that you exude, and that you quickly grow more and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">depressed</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">insane</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantIllness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantIllness">tumor-ridden</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">leading up to your eventual</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">death.</a>
<ul><li> Some versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> have a character become violently insane before they get to the point of dying from too much cybernetics, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul">Cybernetics Eat Your Soul</a> feature built in to the game mechanics.
</li></ul></li><li> In a mix of 4 and 5, the Black Savants of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talislanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Talislanta">Talislanta</a></em> were once living necromancers in Khazad, before the Great Disaster. Their people chose to die temporarily to avoid the predicted catastrophe, expecting they'd be returned to life once things had calmed down. But the spells to resurrect them failed, and the majority of Khazad's souls were lost in extraplanar realms of demons and ghosts. The few who <em>did</em> revive, did so in mute, undead bodies. Now, these Black Savants work endlessly to locate the lost souls of their people and bring Khazad back from the dead. Oh, and creep out other Talislantans.
</li><li> In <em>The World Of Darkness</em>, particularly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">The New World of Darkness game-lines</a>, there are a number of different ways to bring a recently deceased person back from the dead. <em>None</em> of them result in a mentally- or spiritually-sound being. Here's a quick run: you can make a Revenant out of them, but that gives you a zombie with a supercharged case of OCD. You can try <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Embracing</a> them, but now they're a vampire and, since you Embraced them <em>after</em> death, their reflection/shadow has come loose and become a separate being that hates them. Making a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean</a></em> out of them opens the door to a laundry list of problems<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1hx95');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1hx95" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1hx95');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Not the least of which is that the "resurrectee" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">actually a whole different person</a>.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters">Geist</a> can haul someone back if they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople">the right sort</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience">enough wiggle room exists,</a> but it's <em>never</em> for free. Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DeviantTheRenegades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DeviantTheRenegades">Deviants</a> have healing powers strong enough to raise the dead, but there's a non-zero chance the resurrected will end up as another Deviant. And finally, the least harmful of all of these, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil">Benediction</a> that resurrects the very-recently-slain... leaves them with a permanent mental illness.
<ul><li> This is also actually the default for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen">Demon: The Fallen</a></em>, since every player character is literally a biblical Demon from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a> that took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">possession</a> of some weakened or recently deceased human body, though it depends on the player how strongly the possessed acts more like its host or the Demon. The host's soul, though, is gone. Additionally, there's a chance for playing this trope straight or any other way by combining the powers of some of the fallen. You can have a Devourer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biomanipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biomanipulation">build a body</a>, a Scourge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatingLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatingLife">animate</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster">it</a> if necessary and a Slayer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">drag a soul from the afterlife</a> or hell or wherever and have it take over that body, then use the lore of humanity to make it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">loyal servant</a>. It's not playing god, if you actually know what you're doing!

The catch? The ritual to do so requires fighting the avatar of the literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">God of Death</a>. Guess what happens if you lose.
</li><li> Another option was to have a soul-shard happen across the recently deceased and make a deal. This one got them brought back better than before, as one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheResurrection">the Amenti</a>, the Reborn. No matter how often they died again, they could resurrect without a hitch (well, barring the waiting period). The OWOD was a bit kinder on this front than the NWOD.
</li><li> One of the ironies of the Mage splat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> is that it actually is possible to bring people back just fine with no ill effect, it doesn't even require archmastery. The reason it usually goes bad is because the kinds of people that play Mage often can't risk trying to bring you back ... 'better'. And that's sort of handing the GM a free pass to mess with things in a game full of paradox and Id demons.
</li><li> The nWOD fangame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em> has this as a serious possibility for Geniuses trying to resurrect the dead. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> is quite possible, and frankly it's one of the more manageable things that could result.

<ul><li> Urien Rakarth, the Dark Eldar Master Haemonculus, discovered the secret of resurrecting himself so long ago, and has done it so many times, that things have started to go inexplicably wrong with the process. He now tends to come back with a small physical reminder of each previous resurrection, usually additional vestigial limbs growing from his spinal sump. Being an utterly insane genius surgeon, body modifier, peerless torturer, and obsessive experimenter, Urien regards this condition as little more than a fascinating quirk and certainly nothing to get all angsty about. Indeed, Urien is so jaded that he practically collects deaths and looks forward to seeing what new and unusual ways he will come back wrong in next.
</li><li> Later Dark Eldar lore revealed that <em>all</em> Dark Eldar raiders make deals with a Haemonculus to resurrect them if they fall in battle. All that's required is a piece of their body, say a finger. Andy Chambers's Dark Eldar novels center on an attempt to resurrect El'Uriaq, an ancient Eldar king whose remains and soul have been stewing in Chaos for ages, and <em>it does not go well</em>.
</li><li> Necron "resurrection protocols" teleport a damaged unit back to its tomb for repair. Necron platforms are over sixty-five million years old, their tech hasn't always weathered the aeons, they get bashed up a lot, and the lords skimped on the quality of their foot soldiers, so Necrons pick up aberrations as they get refurbished: the foot soldiers are barely sentient anymore and describing some lords as "deranged" would be putting it mildly.
</li><li> Even the initial "reawakening" protocols and interment were flawed, causing many of the necrons to become quirky and insane before all this "resurrection" nonsense. Nemesor Zahndrekh is the most notable example, as he still thinks he's a creature of flesh and blood fighting against the other Necrontyr Dynasties rather than waging inter-galactic war against aliens. The Destroyer Cults are ones who were so thoroughly broken by their bio-transference that now they want to utterly annihilate everything (this madness extends to the aptly named Destroyer Lords, and the fluff indicates that this is also responsible for the entire earlier canon fluff; the first of the lords and warriors to awaken had their memories damaged so much that they thought they were still slaves to the C'tans, slavishly carrying out the wills of long-dead gods.
</li><li> According to a microstory in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Inquisitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Inquisitor">Inquisitor</a></em> rulebook, two of the Inquisition's founders opposed the idea of the Emperor being revived in the wake of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a>, because they were afraid that what they brought back wouldn't be the man they once knew. For better or worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">they got their way</a> - he's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine">stuck on the Golden Throne</a> ten thousand years later.
</li><li> Mad Dok Grotsnik was once an Ork Painboy who found himself on the receiving end of a one-sided whooping when the Nobs in his tribe found out about the bombs he planted in their new bionik skulls. Grotsnik was battered beyond recognition and his Gretchin orderlies did what they could to save him, though this did mean that one of them actually lost his lunch while up to his elbows in Grotsnik's exposed braincase, another's pet spider crawled in and found someplace warm and wet and wasn't retrieved, and Grotsnik himself died several times in the night and it was only through inventive use of a Grot-prod that he made it at all. Grotsnik managed against all odds to survive his ordeal, though now he's a complete mess of mutilated flesh and cyborknetics who really is one scalpel short of a medpack.
</li><li> When Chaos Dreadnoughts come to and realize they're trapped in a weaponized sarcophagus (and unlike their Loyalist counterparts, they aren't put in slumber when not in battle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">just chained up and have their weapons deactivated</a>), their sanity doesn't survive, and become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriggerHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriggerHappy">Trigger Happy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seekers</a> as a result... which suits their commanders just fine, and becoming a Dreadnought is a very persuasive threat among Chaos forces.
</li><li> In the spin-off RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em>, player characters are slowly corrupted when they see or handle heretical artefacts or phenomena, culminating in "mutations". One of them is that the character is no longer allowed to die: They will always come back, suffering additional corruption each time, until they fall to Chaos.

</li><li> The curse of the Darksign makes this inevitable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>. The Darksign prevents its bearers from permanently dying, but each resurrection robs them of a little humanity. Eventually they become mindless Hollows. The transformation can be delayed by gathering Humanity, but it's still just a matter of time. The player character doesn't have to worry about this though. Turns out there's a reason for that beyond gameplay mechanics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em> plays around with this, as resurrection plays a huge role in the setting. Generally speaking, whether your revival works or turns out well seems to depend largely on which method is used:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Guardians</a> are dead humans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">exos</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">awoken</a>, or, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">formerly</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">eliksni</a> who have been deemed worthy of resurrection by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">the inert Traveler</a>, based on their past lives and compatibility with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod">Ghost</a>. They are revived and imbued with Light magic, giving them the powers needed to fight evil, as well as a degree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">Resurrective Immortality</a>; they cease aging and, as long as their Ghost is not destroyed or their Light drained, revive when killed. They have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">absolutely no memory of their past lives</a>, and have an unsettling tendency to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">questionably sane</a>. Whether they are an aversion or played straight is a matter of debate, in-universe and out; most see them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenMany">The Chosen Many</a>, but theres a not-insignificant number who see them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">undead</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abominations</a> that would kill anything or anyone just because they think the Traveler wants them to.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">The Scorn</a> play this very straight, as their resurrections are based around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">Dark magic</a>. Similar to the Guardians, they are dead eliksni given life through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Darkness</a>-blessed rituals performed by the Scorned Barons... but <em>un</em>like the Guardians, most Scorn are turned into violent maniacs with no free will or sense of self-preservation. With each revival, less and less of their souls/minds come back with their bodies, until the bodies finally come back as soulless, feral animals dubbed screebs. They also rack up more and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">physical deformities</a>, as their bodies are warped and mutated by the Dark-tainted ether the Barons use to revive them. They can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClippedWingAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClippedWingAngel">fairly easily killed permanently</a> by Lightbearers, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">coming in huge swarms</a> means theyre still very dangerous.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">SIVA</a>-based resurrections zig-zag this, as its debatable if they even really qualify as resurrections. Whatever is brought back, there is no semblance of the original being left at all; the body is effectively just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatPuppet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatPuppet">Meat Puppet</a> animated by SIVA to carry out tasks.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig">The Dig</a></em>, Brink is resurrected with an alien crystal, but slowly turns into an obsessed shadow of his former self. Maggie, seeing this, asks Boston not to use a life crystal on her if something were to happen. If you ignore her wishes and revive her with a crystal, she will yell at you and then throw herself off a building. Luckily, after you save the aliens, they bring both of them back in their original condition. Depending on whether you honored her wishes or not, you either get a hug or a slap.
</li><li> In all <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> games, there are "former humans", which are slain humans brought back to life by demonic rituals, serving as basic demon footsoldiers. They have a healthy shade of skin, lack any visible rot, and are still capable of moving in a human fashion and operating their firearms... but their red eyes, monstrous growls, and pained breathing when active indicate that there is something <em>very wrong</em> with them (also counting the rather obvious fact that they are shooting at you).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege">Dungeon Siege</a> III</em>, Jeyne revives archons who come back as twisted, cold monsters. Then she revives a god. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">That doesn't work out so well either</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series has seemingly every type of magic <em>except</em> for true resurrection, leading to all deaths being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Deaths</a> in-universe. (There is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancy">Necromancy</a>, but that's not <em>quite</em> the same thing...) In the few in-universe cases where someone has had some success with true resurrection, the person that is resurrected is typically either deranged in some way or suffers from some other issue.
</li><li> Mild example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon">Fallen London</a></em> with the Tomb Colonists. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a> in the Neath, and aside from certain nasty methods you're certain to get back up from death. However, when you come back your corpse might not be in such a good state, depending on how messy it was. After a certain point people just wrap themselves up in bandages and leave for the Tomb Colonies, where people are much more open towards such insignificant things as looking like a zombie leper.
</li><li> Defied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>. Dead people can remain as "unsent", essentially revenants that age normally (but can't die from old age), eat, sleep and in all other ways appear exactly as a living person. As far as is shown in the game, they don't appear to behave differently than they did in life. Good people are still good, and bad people are still bad but don't actually appear to go "worse". It is still considered desirable for souls to move on, as many of the unsent characters do just that once their business in the world of the living is done.
</li><li> Various things in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>:
<ul><li> As revealed in the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Primals are not creatures that are created through numerous crystals and the prayers of others, their figures warped and their negative traits ramped up.

</li><li> In <em>Stormblood</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's revealed the Qaiyana Tribe of Ananta snake women had this problem. The Ala Mhigan soldier for the Garleans, Fordola, had kidnapped the daughter of their queen, hoping to draw out a person known as the Butcher.

She did, but without her soul, leaving her a husk of her former self.</span>

Additionally, when King Garon died he replaced Garon's spirit with that of a monster servant with access to Garon's memories, and who Anankos can control as he pleases.
</li><li> In the <em>Heirs of Fate</em> DLC, he does this not only on the former four, but on the dead parents of the second generation kids whose worlds he destroyed.
</li><li> In the <em>Conquest</em> route, he does this to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Takumi</span>, while in the <em>Revelation</em> route he does this to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Scarlet</span>; in both cases, all you can do for them is put them out of their misery.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims1">The Sims</a></em> introduced Zombies. Sims can play rock paper scissors with the grim reaper to save another from death, but if the reaper is in a bad mood, he only brings them back half way. Zombies are tinted green and lose ALL of their personality points, making them all dirty, mean, lazy slobs who don't like to play or talk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2">The Sims 2</a></em> lets players dial up the reaper to ask for an already-dead sim to be resurrected. Offering too small of a bribe results in a Zombie, who has a set personality, and loses most or all of their skill points, essentially making them a different person. Their skin is blue, their facial expression is sagging and in pain, and they shamble instead of walking.

Even worse, he appears to have trouble keeping this skin rigid, resulting in zombie-like posture and an odd sort of limp. Worse still, his personality has become far darker than before as he is stated to be out for revenge against all who wronged him. His battle intro has him threatening to outright <em>kill</em> his opponent, a far cry from the patriotic soldier we know and love. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">As an upside, he seems to have gained impressive new abilities such as teleportation and the ability to perform aerial Flash Kicks.</a>

Instead of watching them die, the Determination gave the monsters the sheer will to shrug off their lethal wounds and incurable diseases... but unfortunately, overusing Determination causes monster bodies to <em>melt</em>, and what was left on the floor merged into terrifying Amalgamates. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted, though — this didn't change their temperament one bit, and both they and their families were glad to be reunited in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>.</span>
<ul><li> The big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reveal">Reveal</a> of the True Lab is even worse — Alphys's other experiment was to try infusing Determination into something that didn't have a SOUL. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The golden flower that sprouted where Asriel died. This resulted in Asriel being essentially reincarnated as a SOULless creature incapable of feeling love - Flowey.

</li></ul></li><li> People brought back by the Necris process in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal">Unreal</a></em> series have, up until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII">Unreal Tournament III</a></em>, are bodies consisting of nearly no colors at all, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">just as happy (if not moreso) to indulge in the sanctioned massacres as the next man</a>.

Because zombies in this game are random dead souls who get trapped in random dead bodies, he could have become just another monster... but he gets trapped into his <em>own</em> dead body by accident, making him fully conscious and horribly disturbed at his own undeath.
</li><li> Necromancy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> almost always results in someone coming back wrong:
<ul><li> Death Knights are intentionally designed to be damaged in some way so they can be better killing machines for the Lich King.
</li><li> <em>Cataclysm</em> gives us the Rotbrain, which are the new villains of Deathknell. One priest sadly notes that they seem human outside, but are sick within. They eventually rally and plan to take over the town, and must be killed.
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Marshal Redpath</a>:</strong> I'm a monster, don't look at me!
</div></li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">alternate interpretation</a> of the "Rotbrain" is that they've come back wrong in a different way: without the blind devotion to the Forsaken that undead player characters possess.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, this is the case for the Forsaken. The state of undeath is an imperfect "chain" of dark magic holding the soul of a person to their rotting corpse, and these chains cause malevolent tendencies and negative emotions to become more apparent. Forsaken can still feel positive emotion, though, so they're not <em>monsters</em>, they can rise above it and become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti Heroes</a>.
</li><li> Sylvanas's short story revealed there is another underlying issue with the Forsaken. Being torn from the afterlife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagedSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagedSoul">damaged their souls</a>, which could play a part in their darker tendencies. Worse this seems to have condemned them to a hellish afterlife.
</li><li> The <em>Legion</em> expansion actually managed to invert the trope in one instance. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">High Inquisitor Sally Whitemane</span> was a zealous murderer and completely insane in life. When chosen to be risen by the Knights of the Ebon Blade into a Death Knight, she's focused and stable again. Death has a way of quelling the madness of the mind.

<ul><li> Immortals in general use an intentional form of this. Immortals have to "reset" every few centuries in order to avoid going insane, but the new Immortal is functionally a new person, who only remembers their past self's life "as though reading about it from a book". They can make some things stick (such as Jerry ensuring that the debt he owed Susan would be carried over and not dismissed), but for most part shedding the excess baggage is seen as a <em>good</em> thing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pandora has postponed her own reset for several centuries, and it's definitely caused her problems.</span>

Since all he gets are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoullessShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoullessShell">Soulless Shell</a>-types anyway, he's stopped putting much effort into making them look lifelike and actually calls them zombies.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>:
<ul><li> Science can resurrect someone if their head (brain) is intact, but there are many possible side effects, like memory loss, insanity, and some sort of "cascade effect that normally sets the lab on fire." Later on, it's revealed that, if the one operating is an expert, one can be brought back from death even without an intact brain. However, the end result is just a body without a true mind, essentially, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoullessShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoullessShell">Soulless Shell</a>.
</li><li> Because of a combination of this trope and the fact that spark resurrection (especially self-resurrection) that works perfectly is still often a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a>, one of the only actual explicit universal laws that the Fifty Families agree on is that a ruler that dies loses his crown permanently, no matter how immortal/invincible/etc she later becomes and whether her mind is intact or not. Gil gives a slightly more cynical explanation; nobles don't want someone ahead of them in the line of succession to just pop back to life and disrupt their claim, so they made the rule that you're out if you die. It's not uncommon for nobles to get resurrected and then try to hide it, which Gil and his father think makes for wonderful blackmail material.
</li><li> A variation occurs with Tarvek's sister Anevka, given a mechanical new body plugged into life support with what remained of her own. However, Anevka still died, albeit slower than she would have normally, but, as she weakened, the machine itself took on her personality. By the time she was dead, the machine thought she was Anevka and had no idea that anything (such as the death of the real Anekva) had happened, and everyone believed the same, except Tarvek, who knew the truth. The mechanical Anevka eventually became conniving and self-serving, culminating in killing her father after his attempts to restore the Other "almost" killed her. No word yet on whether this cold-hearted behaviour was a result of being a clank or being an accurate copy of a member of the Sturmvoraus family.

Usually anything other than Raise Dead / Resurrection results in this trope. Especially golems, which are mindless monsters remote-controlled by their owners.

He didn't. They were clones that were just released from their tubes too early. Apparently they feel like Stretch Armstrongs.
<ul><li> One of Dean's clones was rejected (meaning Doc casually flushed him into the sewer) for being extremely disfigured. The clone survived, and used the skins of all of the previous dead clones (apparently Doctor Venture just dumps them in a mass-grave on the compound) to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">Dean suit</a> for himself. When he runs out of skins, he attempts to murder the current Dean so he can finish the suit and replace him.
<ul><li> It probably goes without saying that the rejected clone was severely schizophrenic, and he believed Doctor Venture was guiding him through the process.
</li></ul></li><li> The page image is from one of Venture's more unusual experiments to resurrect the dead, Venturestein from the episode "¡Viva los Muertos!". Rusty was apparently more interested in doing it just to see if he could, as he put it "laugh in God's face," but soon found the only application he could have for this particular form of resurrection was selling his zombies to the military for willing suicide bombers.

<ul><li> Sometimes a person who "dies", as in no breath or pulse, can be brought back to life via CPR or other medical care. However, current medical tech cannot get around the fact that most people can only go without oxygen for about 4 minutes before brain damage sets in, 6 minutes tops. The greater the delay, the worse it gets. It can get to the point where the person isn't there anymore and all you have is a body that (with help) breathes and has a pulse. Among other possible results, less hopeless but still not nice by any standards, are people who forget how to read, walk or use the toilet. Less disastrously, they can forget things that aren't required for basic day-to-day functioning but are still of some significance, such as major life events. They may also behave differently - anger issues in particular are common among people who suffer from this sort of brain damage.
<ul><li> If a person dies while under extreme hypothermia, revivability can be extended much longer due to their lowered metabolism.
<ul><li> There's a saying in emergency medicine: "You aren't dead 'til you're warm and dead".
</li><li> You may still suffer damage to your brain, limbs, etc. so that you may not be able to do things as well as before your revival.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a rail worker with a kind disposition, lost a good chunk of his brain in an accident and survived. After the accident, he became angry very easily and took greater risks, and his friends would describe him as "no longer Gage."
<ul><li> It's worth noting that the bulk of the damage was in the left frontal lobe, which is also the section of the brain targeted during the now-obsolete practice of lobotomy. Gage's case was the confluence of several factors, including: post-injury infection caused by the town doctor rooting around with his fingers inside Gage's braincase, damage to the frontal white matter of his brain (which is a critical regulatory structure in addition to other important functions, and the fact that he explosively lobotomized himself with a meter long, six-kilo iron bar. However, it's equally important to note that the majority of the symptoms ascribed to Gage's injury have, over the years, been both exaggerated from the truth as well as just outright fabricated. Much of the blame for this belongs to doctor John Harlow, who was responsible for Gage's initial treatment. Rather than acquiring a reliable patient history, Harlow encouraged the belief that Gage's blast to the brain turned him into a psychopath, likely in a bid for personal fame.
</li></ul></li><li> Rosemary Kennedy (sister of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>) potentially has this happen <em>twice</em>. First, during her birth, Rosemary was deprived of oxygen, which is generally believed to have changed her from the person she would have been otherwise, leaving her with developmental disabilities and difficulty regulating her emotions. Then, when those emotional difficulties she had as a result of the first incident became unmanageable, doctors convinced her father that a lobotomy would calm her difficult behavior. Instead, the procedure destroyed Rosemary's mental capabilities, leaving her unable to walk, talk, or regulate her basic body functions. (She regained some limited abilities over the years, but was never able to return to anything remotely resembling her previous level of function.)
</li><li> In general, traumatic head injuries can cause significant changes in survivors. It doesn't exactly create new personality traits, but it can lead to things like increased irritability and problems with impulse control, which can make a person seem very different to an outside observer. Severe brain injuries can also impair a person's physical and mental capabilities.
