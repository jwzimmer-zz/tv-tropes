</div></div><p>A lie or deception that takes on a life of its own, spiraling out of the control of the ones who started it and often mutating in the process.

Sometimes, though, a perfect Snowball Lie will show no signs of ever stopping, and its creators will find themselves forced to kill it — with varying degrees of success, and varying degrees of repercussions to themselves. In particularly ironic situations, the Snowball Lie can become an unstoppable juggernaut that displaces the truth and becomes a new "truth" in its own right.

Unfortunately, one of them spreads it around London and Arabella is forced to keep up the pretence in order to save her reputation. Luckily, her love interest is rich enough to cover up the fact that she isn't.

What's more, the government <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">changes the records at will</a> to whatever suits their current purposes.

Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>, the Martians wouldn't accept <em>anything</em> short of the man's death as being a valid excuse for not appearing on time, and the repercussions for non-attendance could escalate into outright war.

Since the money they would have had to pay the band is gone, and the kids at school would tear the two of them apart if no band was present, him and his friend set up a fake punk-rock band called <em>The Dregs of Humanity</em> consisting of a bunch of skeletons on wires on a darkened stage and a recording he created. This works, a reporter gets an interview with the group (not knowing that he's actually talking to a kid doing the voices of skeletons manipulated by wires) that he sells to a magazine, and it ends up that other groups want to book the now famous band into multiple locations, and pay them huge booking fees. This sounds great until various groups threaten suit, claiming that <em>The Dregs of Humanity</em> had committed various acts of mopery and dopery including plagiarizing songs, trashing hotel rooms around the country, and getting a girl pregnant.

<ul><li> In the fourth season episode "The Two Mrs. Cranes", Daphne lies to an old boyfriend who wants to get back with her by pretending to be married to Niles. Things spiral from there, so Frasier ends up being divorced from 'Maris', whom Roz takes the role of when she happens to stop by the apartment. And then Daphne decides that the old boyfriend isn't so bad after all, but Niles isn't keen to give up playing the doting husband, and Roz has also taken a shine to him, which means that the two women spend most of the evening making up ever more ludicrously horrible stories about each other to put the boyfriend off, until Roz ends up being an alcoholic anorexic and Daphne is pregnant. And then to really complicate things, Martin gets involved and to really piss everyone off starts spinning yarns about how he used to be an astronaut. And the boyfriend <em>believes every single word they tell him</em>, no matter how ludicrous, and ends up shooting down Roz and Daphne because he believes them to be utterly horrible women who are stupid enough to shamelessly flirt with him in front of their 'husbands'. And then it's capped with the perfect line from Frasier:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Daphne</strong>: Really, we're not the awful people you think we are! <br/><strong>Frasier:</strong> No, the truth is <em>we've been lying to you all night</em>!

</li><li> There's an episode where Martin wants to get out of a date with the mother of a woman that Frasier met when they were at the opera together, and tells the mother that he's gay. She tells her daughter, and the daughter sets Martin up with her gay uncle, also at the opera that night. It takes Martin a long time to realize it, but when he does he goes to great lengths to get out of dating the other man, including introducing Niles as his boyfriend. One of the best moments happens when Niles gets fed up with being forced into the lie and stages a break-up so over-the-top and hilarious that it seems implausible even compared to one of Frasier's typical break-ups.

Things escalated when Colin returned months later and confronted John before dying from a brain hemorrhage in front of him and Charlotte. In a panic, John buried the body in a nearby construction site and had to further compound the lie when Colin's mother got involved.

<ul><li> The plot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DearEvanHansen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DearEvanHansen">Dear Evan Hansen</a> revolves around the titular character becoming entangled in a web of lies as he convinces everyone that he was best friends with Connor Murphy, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath">commited suicide near the beginning of the show.</a> Shortly after Connors suicide, the Murphys find the note Connor had with him, which was Evans letter he wrote to himself for therapy, and assume Evan and Connor were friends. Evan, too nervous to refute, agrees, and soon, he teams up with Jared to create fake emails to prove that they were friends. As the story progresses, Evan starts The Connor Project, which is devoted to honoring Connors memory; forms a close bond with the Murphys; and gets close to his crush, Zoe (who was Connors little sister). As Evan falls deeper and deeper into his lie, he feels trapped, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eventually confesses that he was lying all along in the heart-wrenching number <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevenOClockNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevenOClockNumber">Words Fail.</a></span>
</li><li> Neil Simon's <em>Rumors</em> features a lie that gets confused and destroyed not once, not twice, but <em>three</em> times, first when the main couple are letting the other couples in and need to explain what Charlie and Myra are doing, second when the police officers first show up, and third, in a dramatic monologue about what allegedly really happened <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it actually did</span> to get the cops off their back for the last time.
</li><li> The Norwegian comedy <em>Rett i Lomma</em> (<em>Right in The Pocket</em>, referring to easily obtained money) is built on this trope. It is about a man who lost his job, and the money he gets from renting out apartments on the side in his house isn't enough to keep it going. The very same day, however, he gets a welfare check from the bank to "Mr. Thomason", who had recently moved to Canada. He decided to use it for himself instead of forwarding it. Then he finds out that by inventing a few fake occupants with various family and illnesses, the government would keep sending him money to support them. Cue the actual start of the play, where he decides that it has gone on for long enough and that he will have to "kill them off". Unfortunately, this only makes things worse because of the payout for funeral, etc. And then, an inspector knocks on the door and wants to look through all his paperwork for the last two years. It ends up with him having to not only play the part of Thomason, but also having to drag in his only real occupant as he walks in on a conversation and starts asking questions. Then an agent from the funeral service and his assistant arrives, as well as his uncle, his friend's girlfriend and his own wife. The network of different lies and explanations soon expand and start conflicting, and the two friends also have to make up lies while separate from each other. Therefore you get such situations as the apparently deaf Normann answering the phone, the wife having to be "accidentally" locked into their bedroom because she became too annoying, and the inspector being served tea and wine until he's drunk. It finally collapses upon them as the inspector's much more level-headed boss arrives, and the main character is given a new job as inspector because he "knows every trick in the book". While hard to follow, at least the convoluted thing was damned funny and had a happy ending.

</li><li> Perhaps one of the most tragic and best-known cases of this were the Salem witch trials in colonial America. The witch hunt was started by three girls who claimed to be possessed by demons, and who went into "fits" because of it. When they later confessed to lying about it, however, the trend was so huge and so many people were caught up in such a panicky situation that the people simply refused to believe them, choosing instead to believe that it was the demons within them who were making them "confess" their lies.

After he had accused his own mother of witchcraft and gotten her executed in his hometown Gävle, he was sent to relatives in Stockholm, where he continued to accuse people and got other children to do the same. This went on for quite some time, until someone realised that he knew a bit too much about witchcraft for being a victim, and he himself was sentenced to death. He panicked and confessed to lying, but was executed for that instead.

Doubleday, a military hero, never claimed to have invented baseball, and there's no evidence he'd ever even visited Cooperstown. In fact, the first printed reference to baseball in America <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">was in 1791</a>. In 1908, 15 years after Doubleday died, a commission whose open aim was to prove that baseball was strictly American in origin announced their findings that Doubleday was the inventor. This claim was based the testimony of just one person, an elderly mentally ill man, who would have have been a young boy in 1839. The report was forgotten until the 1930s. Then Major League Baseball kicked of a massive campaign to celebrate the supposed centennial of baseball in 1939, culminating in the opening of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
</li><li> Various child abuse scandals, especially those with supposed Satanic cult connections and multiple alleged perpetrators, result from this: one suspicious parent, teacher, or social worker questions a child (who may or may not be an actual abuse victim) and soon worried parents are questioning their kids and the number of "victims" and "abusers" starts expanding dramatically.
</li><li> Your typical "moral panic" starts out as a joke among teenagers on the school bus or in the locker room, an adult takes the joke as irrefutable fact, and suddenly talk shows are hosting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent">parents crusading</a> against kitschy fashion accessories and soda can pull tabs. Some moral panics make their way onto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForensicDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForensicDrama">Forensic Dramas</a>, like the "rainbow party" panic that leapt from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOprahWinfreyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOprahWinfreyShow">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a>. Then there's the porn industry, which is always eager to make a profit from anything scandalous and may even attempt to play up parents' fears while advertising material based on moral panics.
</li><li> French con-man Frédéric Bourdin claims that his infamous attempt to assume the identity of Nicholas Barclay, a missing American teen, was an example. Bourdin had cobbled together a living by repeatedly passing himself off as a runaway teen and getting free room and board from government agencies around Europe. However, when he tried his con to Spain, the authorities insisted that he provide verifiable identification for who he was. Fearing he would be arrested if he did not provide an identity, Bourdin acquired Nicholas Barclay's information and claimed to be him. When the authorities began moving forward with reuniting him with his "family," Bourdin simply went along with it.
<ul><li> And to make this story even weirder, it's possible that this collided with <em>another</em> Snowball Lie by the part of the Barclay family: Bourdin neither looked nor acted like Nicholas (which Bourdin excused with a ludicrous explanation of being kidnapped and experimented on by a ring of child molesters) and yet the Barclays insisted that he was Nicholas even as an independent investigator figured out the truth and pointed out the inconsistencies. When he finally confessed, Bourdin claimed that based on the insistence as well as the fact that Nicholas' mother and half-brother treated him oddly and coldly, they had actually murdered Nicholas, pretended he had gone missing, and thus kept up the charade with Bourdin once he showed up. The investigator actually agrees with Bourdin but the case has gone cold after Nicholas' half brother suddenly killed himself.
