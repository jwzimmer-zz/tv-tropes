It's unclear how much Yuiji's poor treatment is because of the gender imbalance, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">how much is because he's human</a>. If nothing else, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> K-01</span> is literally worshipped by male dinosauroids as divine <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> although this might be purely the result of her psychic powers influencing their minds.</span>

Making him the only one who can help repopulate it. The end of the anime <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has an inversion: The men from Airantou had drifted to another nearby island, creating the exact opposite situation when Ikuto's sister washed up there. We see her, and she describes a situation that is almost identical to what Ikuto went through, just as a girl on an island of guys instead, where the men on the other island are all treating her respectfully wheras many of the females with Ikuto have various levels of intent to claim him as their own.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku">Ooku</a></em>, due to the Redface Pox, women outnumber men 4:1. As a result of the Gendercide being due to health reasons, men basically don't have to do anything except breed: women didn't stop doing household chores, they just took over traditionally male work as well. Having a husband becomes extremely expensive and most women resort to male prostitutes to have an heir. Only men in the Ooku have any form of political pull that isn't the result of being married or a son to anyone with political power.
</li><li> Plenty of Sci-Fic<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove">Yaoi</a> mangas have the setting of a severe lack of women, leading to those women only interacting with the best of the best (by choice or by force) while the lesser men enter homosexual relationships for love and sex. Alternatively, some of the "good" men buy themselves lesser men for entertaining purposes. The most famous example for the latter would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi">Ai no Kusabi</a>.

Also a literal Gender Rarity Value, a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Brother's Price</a>" is how much a family gets for selling their brother. Usually it's just a swap for another family's brother or a straight sale to a family for cash. The male ends up marrying all the women in the new family, unless they split it between older and younger sisters. However there is also the option of selling him to a "Crib" aka whorehouse, where he'll spend the rest of his life drugged to the eyeballs on fantasy world viagra impregnating women who can't afford to buy a husband.

<ul><li> The golden "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic">queen</a>" dragons are <em>both</em> the rarest dragons and the only fertile females. Queen dragons make up about five percent of the entire dragon population, while greens (the smallest and lowest-ranking) are about half the population. Interestingly, greens are also female, and are only sterile because (like the males) they are fed firestone to allow them to breathe flame. Brief scenes involving a young gold dragon seem to suggest that if they were to withhold firestone from a green (either from hatching, possibly allowing them only a small ration thereof; or from a mature green) they may produce viable clutches. This does produce mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> moments with the primary plot point from the first novel, but they may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> or justified by the fact that it's said that green clutches produce smaller, weaker hatchlings than gold clutches. Also, only golds produce another gold, one per clutch or less. When you need dragons to keep your planet from being devoured by Thread, you want big, strong dragons with stamina, thus from golds and not greens.
</li><li> In the first novel, the dragons' numbers have dwindled during the Long Interval to the point that the last operating Weyr has only ever had <em>one</em> living queen dragon at any time.
</li><li> In <em>Dragonsdawn,</em> the origin story of how the colonists came to Pern and how the dragons were created, it's revealed that the above points are likely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendFadesToMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendFadesToMyth">misinterpretation of the ACTUAL reason</a> green dragons are sterile: They were bio-engineered to be that way.

This is largely due to a religious beliefs that held women were incapable of bearing serious responsibility in men's areas.

</li><li> In the dystopian novel <em>Prized</em> by Caragh O'Brien, the sequel to <em>Birthmarked</em>, Gaia leaves the Enclave with her baby sister to find her grandmother. She is captured by a society called Sylum, where female babies are rare. The society is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy">matriarchy</a> where women are prized and men and childless women are looked down upon.

When advanced reproductive technology comes to patriarchal Barayar most people naturally use it to favor boys but motherless, sisterless (but not brotherless, and that's a very important point) Drou Koudelka uses it to make sure all four of her children are girls. Her husband Commodore Koudelka later admits he was only amenable to this plan after he was convinced that gender rarity value would make his daughters very hot commodities in the future. And sure enough the four sisters of "Team Koudelka" all end romantically attached to rising stars in the military, commerce, government and the sciences.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert">Frank Herbert</a>'s <em>The White Plague</em>, a geneticist is driven mad when his wife and twin daughters are killed by an IRA bomb, so he takes revenge on the world by creating a disease which is carried by men but fatal to women. By the end of the book, a new set of customs is revolving about the status of women, with an odd combination of worship and slavery. (Basically, society expects that the women will have multiple children by multiple men, but the women can choose whom they want to procreate with so long as they aren't exclusive. Spinsterhood is not an option for a human race that came close to extinction.)

As a result, females who can reliably bring larger litters to term are considered extremely valuable, and to prevent themselves from becoming pawns of the tribes, women have segregated themselves into single-sex clans. One planet is mentioned to have once been the main base of a notorious female krogan warlord, who was one of the last women around who could reliably bear living offspring - and who parlayed that into a position of enormous power, gathering a literal armada of male krogan to her banner.
</li><li> For Salarians, the race is 90% male, but they rarely wield political power. The females wield the highest ranks through being clan matriarchs. This is subverted for the Salarians, however, because the females closely regulate the gender of their children, enforcing the 90/10 ratio. There's a logical reason for their doing so, as well. Salarians are "haplo-diploid oviparous" reproducers. Basically, females lay eggs frequently (at least once a year, if not more), even without any sexual contact; unfertilised eggs hatch as males, fertilised eggs hatch as females. This is balanced by a 40-year lifespan, but the salarian colonies still tend to require careful self-regulation to avoid overpopulation.

Everything, therefore, is run by women while men are property to be traded and protected.

Men are rated on a number of "encounters" per month. A particular stud is famous for having the average count in the 200s (that's over 6 women per <em>day</em>), and a man is forcibly separated from his wife and placed in a repopulation facility. And she's not allowed to even see him, much less sleep with him, because she's <em>not attractive enough</em> for their eugenics program.

Due to the lack of Chinese women, the government has granted women the right to marry more than one husband, with the first husband still being the nominal head of the family, and has encouraged families to take on the women's family name (rather than the husbands') to encourage the birth of more girls. Nonetheless, families more often than not prefer male sons and girls are only deemed valuable by greedy parents hoping to sell them for an exorbitant bride price. Not that the situation is better off for the titular "excess males" who are viewed suspiciously by society and their government as volatile, sex-crazed, and potentially murderous due to their unmarried status.

As such, women on that world are treated with great respect and tend to be sheltered and hidden away from anything that could conceivably be a danger. On the other hand, unprotected women are in considerable danger: the lack of women has made many of the men sexually frustrated, and willingness to rape is quite high. The only reason the female doctor is permitted on a spaceship voyage to the outer system is because she is elderly, and therefore long past being sexually attractive or having any childbearing value.

</li><li> <em>The Rainbow Cadenza</em> by J. Neil Schulman is a rare example of <em>both at the same time;</em> It all starts with cheap sex-selection technologies, specifically an over-the-counter drug called Adamine which suppresses the production of X-chromosome-carrying sperm, ensuring that any child a man sires while taking the drug is male. In anticipation of World War Three, first-world nations approve tax incentives supporting the use of the drug, hoping to breed a critical mass of soldiers to be drafted. As a result, an entire generation almost totally eschews bearing female children. In the aftermath, males outnumber females by a factor of 20. And many of them have PTSD. And do to the remaining women what crazy, violent men have done throughout history. <br/>To counter this, the newly-created world government alters the draft; similar to the current laws for soldiers, all able-bodied women are conscripted for state-sponsored prostitution from the ages of 18-21 - any male that has paid their taxes and has not been convicted of a crime can make use of them in a controlled environment. After they finish their service, "veterans" receive a generous enough stipend that they can live comfortably without having to work, and their votes in political matters are worth 20 of a heterosexual man's(while a homosexual or an asexual's are worth 10, as they do not make use of the service). A democratic majority of women support this system as it promotes them to a status enjoyed by South African whites under apartheid a la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmitageIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmitageIII">Armitage III</a></em>, with the "draft dodging" remainder becoming "Touchables" with no recognized human rights. <br/>Schulman wrote the book <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pulpless.com/jneil/wilgus.html">as an attack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription">conscription</a>;

Due to exposure to cosmic radiation, the original settlers have developed a mutation that turns the female-to-male birth ratio as 7:1. The low number of males necessitates polygamy to allow the population to grow. Being constantly at war with the neighboring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a>, the Tilians have developed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> culture. Strangely, despite the small number of males, only men are soldiers and have a much higher status than women (this may have something to do with the novel being written in 1960). Additionally, some men are born completely lacking in initiative and are, thus, useless in combat, being relegated to a second-class status of servants.

Still, it's possible for the females to get involved in the fighting too; two of the gremlin faction leaders are female, and there's several female gremlin special characters as well, ranging from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Trixibelle</a> to a somewhat homely gremlin female who flies on a homemade rocket pack.
</li><li> The monstrous swamp-creatures called silurids have only one female per ten males, and so females form the center of their communes, rearing their broods whilst the males bring them food and defend them against attack.

For a while, men were relegated to 'traditional women's' roles in society and reduced in status, though by the time of the setting, this had eased (along with the gender imbalance) for all intents and purposes they have equal rights, though Alpha Centauri women outnumber their men in Star Fleet and other branches of Federation government.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer Fantasy Battles</a></em>, only one tenth of all dwarfs are born female. Dwarf holds are ruled over by kings and women hold little political power but are still highly respected in their society. Women may marry more then one man in which case they are encouraged to marry brothers. Dwarf women are so prized that many of them are <em>literally</em> worth their weight in gold as the price of their dowry; this means most dwarf men prefer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">bigger brides</a>.

<ul><li> Boys are born slightly more often than girls but are slightly less likely to survive to adulthood due to a number of various factors affecting their survival: Men are more likely to inherit certain genetic diseases like hemophilia due to only having one X chromosome, men are also more likely to take risks with their lifestyles ranging from high-stress or high-risk occupations (such as applying to the military) and hobbies (Like extreme sports) to not paying much attention to their own physical health. Even when they don't take risks, there is the military draft which usually only drops men into war, even when there's a shortage, and men are more likely to be targeted for violent crime and even murder unless the motivation is specifically gender-based. The differences (on the order of 1% either way, depending upon culture) are far too small to constitute rarity.
</li><li> Eusocial hymenopteran insects like Bees and Ants have three sexes: fertile females (queens), fertile males (drones), and sterile females (workers). These sexes are generally produced in ratios of 1:10s:10,000s; and though queens, drones, and workers all have different tasks to perform; 'worship' or 'enslavement' is just not the right terminology, as bee and ant hives cannot really be said to be composed of individuals - they are superorganisms, with queens and drones being the genitals of the composite creature. That being said, a lot of effort is devoted to the health and well-being of the reproductive units of the hive/colony at the expense of the sterile workers; but that maintenance often includes killing old or diseased or foreign queens.
</li><li> In China, male children currently outnumber females about 117 to 100 in the recent generations. Since the beginning of the One-Child Policy in 1978, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_women_of_Asia">female fetuses have been aborted more often than males and newborn girls are sometimes killed or abandoned<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; this is the result of the law interacting with the tradition in China is that the men carry the family name and take care of their parents in their old age<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5xpug');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5xpug" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5xpug');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the Policy was changed to two children in January 2016, so it's too early to tell how much the demographics will change in the future</span>. This is especially common in rural areas where traditional social norms may be the only safety net for the elderly. It is significantly less common in wealthier urban areas, where women have much greater access to education and jobs and their contribution to the household is viewed more equitably. The rural shortage of women has made it increasingly difficult for young men to find wives and has sometimes resulted in internal and international human trafficking because families are willing to pay substantial sums for a bride, consenting or not. The Chinese government has been working to raise the status of female children and end these practices but attitudes change more slowly than laws.
</li><li> During the colonization of America between the 1600s and 1800s, Native Americans were often targeted by the settlers for their land. The genocide and plague, while it did ultimately eradicated nearly 90% of all natives, had first initially massacred Native males in certain tribes. The shortage got so bad to the point where Native American women would attempt to purchase African slaves from the settlers simply to free and marry them into the tribe, since there were not enough native males. It's worth noting that the African slave trade had also initially targeted males, so there was plenty for them to buy.
</li><li> In Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the male/female gender ratio is about 2 to 1, because the countries' economies rely on large numbers of overwhelmingly male guest workers from other countries like Bangladesh. Alaska has a similar gender imbalance, as a considerable chunk of the population is employed in traditionally male manual labor jobs like fishing and oil rig maintenance.
</li><li> A woman in technical or engineering studies or a man in education and personal beauty jobs will often find themselves the only (fe)male in the immediate vicinity. Depending on their views on the topic, and the attitudes of their co-workers, this can be isolating and unpleasant enough to drive them out of the field entirely in search of a more equitable environment, perpetuating the cycle of underrepresentation.
</li><li> While their number have been increasing in the past years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdsAreSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdsAreSexy">Female Nerds</a> still occasionally feel treated like yetis or fetishized in unrealistic ways by their male counterparts.
</li><li> Biologists analyze the behaviors and actions of species in terms of "genetic fitness", which is basically the proportion of an individual's genes in the next generation. Whenever the ratio of a given sex goes down relative to the other, it becomes more advantageous (in terms of fitness) to have offspring of that sex, so that sex is temporarily more valuable. In the long run, this causes nearly all sexually reproducing species to have an equal ratio of males to females, even for species whose males spend most of their lives alone and thus (it would appear) don't contribute much to the group's welfare. The mothers in some species have developed means to determine the offspring's sex in response to apparent conditions.
</li><li> As of 2011, there's mounting concern in America that the relative absence of men from higher education and the disparate impact of unemployment on male-dominated fields in the wake of the recession have left many college-educated women without opportunities to meet and have relationships with their educational and social peers. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/fashion/07campus.html?pagewanted=all">57% of American college students are female<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and some colleges are quietly and controversially engaging in affirmative action benefiting men in order to avoid a skewed sex ratio that would be seen as hurting the reputation and perceived social life of college campuses. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/opinion/10brooks.html">One-fifth of working-age males are currently not participating in the workforce.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> These trends have been seen as causing an ongoing re-evaluation of traditional marriage and relationship norms and skewing the balance of power in dating towards men, at least according to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/all-the-single-ladies/8654/">this much-discussed article.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Some have claimed that the reluctance of college-educated women to accept less educated or career-driven spouses is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestHerToBedHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestHerToBedHer">itself a form of sexism</a>. However, it is also important to remember that men and women bear the consequences of marriage unequally: with multiple interpretations as to why - Men tend to spend less time on household upkeep after marriage but women spend more, usually being expected to cook and clean as well as working outside the home. Women are often expected to sacrifice their own careers for the sake of their husbands. Or, on the other hand, men are expected to slave away at a difficult job to earn money, while women have less pressure to work themselves to the bone, and can - with the help of modern conveniences - live a life of relative luxury.
<ul><li> Given that black American men are much more likely than white men to be imprisoned (with both longer sentences and more occurrences of false convictions) and they are much more likely to die young, there's been a very large gender gap for black American women for years, which exerts an interesting and possibly unfortunate influence. It's worthy to note that men are imprisoned for longer than women.
</li><li> One thing to consider is that the work inequity that typically exists between working couples doesn't exist or does so in a reduced way in traditional partnerships, namely one person works while the other takes care of household. While this is unrealistic for a lot of working class families, this relationship type is more viable for higher income individuals. What may end up happening if the trend continues is an increase in the number of "house husbands", since men are getting a reduced quality of education for multiple reasons and therefore becoming less desirable to employers, while a woman's value is rising. In order for this kind of adaptation to take hold however, there will need to be a rather radical shift in gender roles and what is considered attractive in a mate.
</li></ul></li><li> Russia has a gender ratio of 86 men to 100 women, due to a higher male death rate from various public health problems (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VodkaDrunkenski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VodkaDrunkenski">widespread alcoholism</a>). <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/oct/27/polygamy-study-russia-central-asia">This has led some people to advocate the legalization of polygamy.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Cucurbits (squashes, pumpkins, gourds, cucumbers, and melons) produce flowers that are either male or female. (Unlike many other plants, whose flowers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite">have female and male parts at the same time</a>). One delicacy is tempura-fried squash blossoms, and since the number of <em>actual</em> squash you'll get depends on how many female flowers you have, and one or two male flowers can pollinate all of them, it's usually the male flowers that are used for culinary purposes more than the female flowers. (Some also say that the male flowers taste better.)
<ul><li> Ginkgo trees are dioecious, which means that individual trees are male and female. The males produce pollen cones and females produce a fruit-like ovules that have seeds. Unfortunately, these "ginkgo fruits" smell like vomit or rancid butter so most people prefer planting male cultivars as opposed to female ones.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/terrorist.asp">"Marriage Squeeze"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> experienced by the Baby Boomers (more specifically, women) as they reached adulthood.
</li><li> Ubiquitous in agricultural animal husbandry, in which female animals' ability to produce milk, eggs, and offspring routinely gets male livestock converted into meat at a younger age than their female counterparts. The exceptions are the valuable "stud" males, whose high-quality genes ensure them a long and pampered lifespan, long after most of the lower-grade males of their generation have been sent to the slaughterhouse. With modern technology, the animal's genes can be used well after the actual animal's death.
</li><li> The gender imbalance among the Chinese population in the United States is remarkable in the late 19th and early 20th century. The male/female ratio went far as 25 to 1 in the 1890 census, because most came in as manual laborers with either not married or have families but left behind in China and only the privileged merchant class can bring their families. It wasn't until after World War II when the exclusion acts were repealed, family lives began and the gender ratio becoming balanced beginning in the 1960s with a massive influx of immigrants.
</li><li> While the casualties of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheTripleAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheTripleAlliance">War of the Triple Alliance</a> are a source of great controversy, one thing that is universal is that they were disproportionately male, with the sex ratio going from fairly even before the war to anywhere from 4 to 20 women for every man depending on the area. The casualities in Paraguay were the worst, with nearly <em>90%</em> of Paraguayan adult males killed. It was so bad that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Pope</a> actually temporarily permitted polygamy there (a practice otherwise wholly forbidden by Catholicism) to bring up the birth rate after this.
</li><li> Sea turtles' sexes are determined largely by the temperature the eggs are kept at. If the eggs are laid in a slightly warmer nest (say, one that gets direct sunlight on the beach), more female turtles will be produced. Cooler nests (say, one that is in the shade, further up the beach) produce males. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-climate-change-producing-too-many-female-sea-turtles/">Climate change may be having an impact on sea turtle nests<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, causing them to warm up, leading to <em>far</em> more female turtles than males.
</li><li> The settlement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a>. Most of the Frontier towns started as <em>work camps</em>, where there were no women. Most of the men who came to those camps had left families behind, or did not have any family to begin with. When women finally <em>did</em> come to the West, they saw that there was a high demand for sex, and since there weren't many other ways for women in the 1800's to make money, they found that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestProfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestProfession">The Oldest Profession</a>, despite its many downsides, was a very lucrative career. In fact, many of them made many times more money than their clients did on a day-to-day basis! And if and when they <em>did</em> decide to get married, this wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadonnaWhoreComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadonnaWhoreComplex">held against them</a> as much as it would have been further East, because women were at such a premium, regardless of whether they were current or former saloon girls, or virgin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Schoolmarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Schoolmarm">schoolmarms</a>. Many of the prostitutes and madams of the Old West used their newfound wealth and power to turn those settlements from work camps to actual towns with (non-sex-related) services that people really needed. This financial independence gave women in the West a level of power and influence that women further East would not have for <em>decades</em>.
</li><li> A large part of the reason for the appearance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaidenAunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaidenAunt">maiden aunts</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne">World War One</a> was that the war killed off large numbers of men, on all sides. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishFlu">The Spanish Flu epidemic</a> didn't help, either, as (unlike most strains of the flu, which tend to be most serious in young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems), this strain of the flu mostly affected people who were young and otherwise healthy, and by some estimates killed off more people than the war did. This left a lot of women who couldn't find partners, because there just weren't enough available young men to go around.
