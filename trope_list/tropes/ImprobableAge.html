In benign cases, it's because the writers assume the audience better identifies with characters their own age.
</p><p>In some cases, an age that is improbable at first glance may actually be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. In ages past, life expectancy was shorter and people <em>needed</em> to be capable at a younger age; in fact, studies seem to indicate that adolescence is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">modern creation</a></em>. This has produced a very curious effect where the longer humans live, the longer the age gap of competence tends to widen. It also must be noted that many of the examples below occur in violent settings; people growing up in a warlike environment have no choice but to adapt and learn to survive, and the faster the better. It's a common problem in societies with inherited positions of authority, although usually some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVizier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVizier">adult regent</a> would be appointed until the heir comes of age.

There is only so much a kid could learn from his local library. This is often the result of creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist">Hot Scientist</a>, with actors in their twenties playing full professors when in reality most people are at least 25 when they first get a PhD.
</p><p>More rarely this trope works at the opposite end of the scale with characters seemingly inexplicably old for their positions, often as a function of being played by a 'name' actor whose recognition or prestige factor outweighs other concerns. This can be especially obvious in fields that require extensive physical fitness; in real life relatively few frontline soldiers or beat cops will be of retirement age.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> takes place in a harsh medieval-esque world where one needs to be pretty sharp from an early age to survive until adulthood, but even considering that there are many youths who reach improbable positions.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a>, Guts, is probably the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">Egregious</a> example because of how early he started as a mercenary. His adoptive father Gambino made him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldier</a> by forcing him to accompany him into battle as his page and practice fencing with live blades at age six. Guts's first battle as a combatant was at age nine, in which he killed his first man, more by luck than anything else. By age eleven, however, he was a bona fide warrior, even managing to single-handedly kill a noble enemy commander, and since he was driven out of his former mercenary camp this was also the age when he effectively became responsible for himself. At fifteen years old he was showing signs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a>, being far stronger and faster than any grown mercenary and managing to defeat the dreaded knight Bazuso, thereby catching the attention of the equally prodigious young mercenary captain Griffith. At the age of eighteen, just three years after Griffith roped him into the Band of the Hawk, he had attained the rank of Captain of the Hawk's Raiders division, effectively answering only to Griffith and having authority over at least a couple hundred men. He made his name as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> in the Hundred Year War by single-handedly defeating a force of no fewer than one hundred Tudor mercenaries, and became a hero of the war by slaying the undefeated General Boscogn in the Battle of Doldrey. And those are just the things he did <em>before</em> he got branded as a demon sacrifice, and had to spend practically every minute of his life fighting against hungry spirits and gargantuan monsters. At the start of the Fantasia Arc, by which time he has fought enough battles to last a lifetime, he is <em>still</em> only 24 years old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">according to the official guide book</a>. Eventually Guts' status as a warrior prodigy is Deconstructed with clear symptoms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron">Dented Iron</a> from having gone through so much physical and mental torture by his early twenties, to the point where his entire body is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredWithScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredWithScars">Covered with Scars</a> and burns and he looks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">a good ten to twenty years older</a> than he actually is, especially since putting on the cursed Berserker Armor for the first time caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe">a patch of his hair to turn white</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> has quite a bit of this, much of which is justified in one way or another.
<ul><li> On the science side, every single esper is under the age of twenty. It is strongly implied that the power development program (at least in its most recent, most effective form) is only about a decade old, so it makes perfect sense that there are no adult espers. The fact that most of the non-esper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normals</a> on the science side are also teenagers is less justified, but there also only a handful of them, so it's not something to worry about too much.
</li><li> On the magic side, it <em>appears</em> that the leader of every single magic cabal, cult, and secret organization is a twelve year-old loli, but it's implied that most of them are significantly older, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">and just using magic to decrease their age</a>. There are ones who are genuinely young, though; Stiyl Magnus is a veteran fire mage at age 14, and Tsuchimikado was Necessarius' feng shui master at the ripe old age of 15. Kanzaki is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">magical equivalent of a nuke</a> at age 16, but then she's a Saint, and was born with her power.
</li></ul></li><li> Ryuu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkagamiNoShirayukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkagamiNoShirayukihime">Akagami no Shirayukihime</a></em> is a fully accredited pharmacist at the age of twelve. He's noted to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> and to be fully capable at his job but he has a lot of trouble dealing with patients even when they don't question or mistrust him and has trouble connecting with people even outside of his work in addition to not having had many of the usual child experiences due to his studies. When he's thirteen he decides he needs to work on these shortcomings after Kirito forces Ryuu to befriend him and a patient tells him he is surprised Ryuu's actually a pharmacist since he always lets others talk to patients for him if he can avoid it himself.
</li><li> By these standards, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>'s Chiyo Mihama almost seems to be slacking off, as at age ten, she's only just starting high school.

Luck didn't get the position because he was spectacularly gifted, but because he's the son of a Mafia boss and (along with his two older brothers) inherited the turf when his father died — and he's <em>very</em> aware of it. A good deal of his ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> persona is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">a front that he puts up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask">in fear of not being taken seriously in his position</a> (and thus targeted).

Although Mayuri lampshaded how improbable it was for a child to possess such high level Quincy ability, Uryuu's father has stated that Uryuu's power is still under-developed and immature; thus the power he used against Mayuri was not the true extent of his abilities. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the age of 17, he's revealed to possess abilities that the thousand-year old Quincy King — who handily defeated Yamamoto — considers threatening enough to need surveillance.</span>

He's approximately 12-13 in terms of biological age. His youth becomes a major weakness that Aizen can exploit but his talent is so great even a shinigami as experienced as Kyouraku believes Hitsugaya can surpass in him around a hundred years or so. Which is a fairly short amount of time by shinigami standards.
</li><li> Gin Ichimaru went through academy training at a very young age, and it only took him a year to complete a six-year programme. He became third seat almost immediately after graduating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by easily killing the current third seat</span>.
</li><li> Ryuuken Ishida is extremely young for his job as the Director of Karakura General Hospital. In a flashback set 20 years before the manga begins (and 5 years before his son is born), he's a high schooler (so under 18). That means he's no older than 40 even after the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. While he's been shown to be so intelligent he can keep up with <em>Urahara</em>, this is still ridiculously young for the level of responsibility involved. Japanese medical education assumes a minimum of 6 years student training, then 2 years of general clinical practice training, followed by 5-6 years of training in a speciality field. If he entered college at 18, he shouldn't have even become a fully qualified surgeon for at least 13 years, let alone become director of a major urban hospital in less than 20. What's more, Uryuu's elementary school flashbacks indicate Ryuuken may have been director for several years now, further straining the limits of probability.
</li><li> Yachiru is a vice-captain who appears to have a biological age of around 7-8 years old. She's immensely strong and fast and seems to have no trouble holding the position of second-in-command to the overpowered Captain Zaraki <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is a subversion that is revealed only in the final stages of the manga.

The spirits of Shinigami swords usually only manifest in a Shinigami's inner world; it's rare for them to manifest in the physical world but not unheard of. Zaraki had no idea, but his sword spirit had been travelling by his side for decades.</span>

</li><li> Overall, The Black Knights' top brass is much younger than other real world military would be. The age ranges from their teens to their early thirties. Compare this in real life, where leaders are typically much older. Of course, this can be justified. After all, they're a rebellion faction formed by younger people and they can't afford to be picky about their members.

<ul><li> Edward Elric is quite young to be a Major in the Army and a State Alchemist... but here, everyone knows this, he's considered something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">genius</a> for it. Ed does actually visibly mature, leading enough people to humorously assume he's simply very short much to his annoyance. It's explicitly stated that passing the state alchemist exam automatically makes you a Major.
<ul><li> It is noted (in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalAlchemist">2003 anime at least</a>) that the only reason he was accepted was because Roy used leverage that he had on a Major General (that he had thanks to Ed's actions) to pull strings to let Ed apply. Under normal circumstances, the military would have rejected him outright as they aren't in the business of hiring 12 year olds, no matter how talented.
</li><li> Also noted that the military's records were wrong, and listed Edward and Alphonse as roughly 25 years older than they actually were, which is the only reason they were sought out to begin with. After that, they let him in not because of his age or string-pulling, but because Fuhrer King Bradley recognized Ed's ability to do clap alchemy and accepted him to keep him on a closer leash leading up to the Promised Day, and Ed is notably never given subordinates, a deployment, or pretty much anything else you might expect a Major to have. Were he anyone else, and were the Fuhrer anyone else, this would not have happened. What fits this trope better is that Ed and Al were able to perform human transmutation before they were ten and Winry became an accomplished automail surgeon in her early teens at the latest.
</li></ul></li><li> The Amestrian military as a whole has a ton of people who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">Improbable Age</a>. Some of the most blatant are Roy Mustang who is in his late 20s and is a Colonel, Hughes who was the same age was a Lt. Colonel, and Olivia Milla Armstrong who is in her early to mid 30s is a Major General. It's justified by showing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">killing a superior officer is a great way to get promoted</a> in the Amestrian government. And as an alchemist, Mustang also started out as a Major, so he could have anywhere between 7-16 years to be promoted two ranks, without breaking canon. It probably helps that Mustang is something of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">an Ace</a>, too. Plus, Mustang <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">distinguished himself</a> in the Ishbalan Rebellion, and so was likely promoted to Colonel for that. Given that Amestris has been in a constant state of war for over three hundred years, being a high-ranking officer at the age of 20-something is justified even without killing one's commanding officer. Constant war, after all, means a constant need to replace dead superiors, and thus anybody skilled enough to stay alive is likely to be promoted to very high ranks.

</li><li> Possibly the most ridiculous example of all is Chrono, who became <em>an Admiral</em> by the age of <em>twenty.</em>
</li><li> Reinforce Zwei held the rank of Sergeant Major at the age of <em>eight</em>, though this can partially be excused by the fact that she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornAsAnAdult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornAsAnAdult">Born as an Adult</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunSize">relatively speaking</a>).

He was not quite ten when he was assigned to the latter post, but that's okay since he somehow also managed to master Japanese. In his class are martial arts masters, genius inventors, retired mercenaries and entrepreneurs, so perhaps it's to be expected that they'd get such an odd teacher. His father was also a celebrated war hero and considered the strongest man in the world by the age of fifteen.

Yuno in particular has the highest kill count in the series, and is seen as horrific by most fans, at least on some level. However most of the other characters are adults so this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> Amuro Ray from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> was an ace mecha pilot at the age of 16. This was a hold over from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robot</a> series where the pilots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> were sometimes teenagers. Somewhat justified in that, despite his age, he has as much time in the cockpit as anyone on his side, since he's literally the only one who ever took <em>the original prototype of the weapon</em> into combat.
</li><li> Kamille Bidan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta Gundam</a></em> is even crazier: he <em>designed</em> the eponymous hyper-advanced mobile suit he ends up piloting. It's handwaved that he's been an amateur mobile suit designer for years... but a <em>Gundam</em>?
</li><li> Usso Ewin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Victory Gundam</a></em> was an expert mecha pilot at the age of 13. Handwaved by the fact that he grew up playing Mobile Suit simulators for an arcade. It's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> repeatedly by almost everyone he meets: both his allies and enemies simply can<em>not</em> believe the pilot of the Victory is a kid.
</li><li> There is, in the Universal Century timeline, exactly one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a> protagonist over the age of twenty. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">Shiro Amada</a> (24).
</li><li> Now also Hughes Courand (32) and Cherie Allison (24), from the oncoming <em>Gundam 0081</em>. Erik Blanke from the same show is a borderline case, as he's 20.Other older pilots would be Bork Cry(28) from Cross Dimensions:0079, Luce Kassel(30) from Space: To the End of a Flash and Travis Kirkland(39) from the Missing Link. There's also a number of older characters in the spinoffs like MS IGLOO..
</li><li> In the Tomino's own novels, that arguably represent his vision of UC more authentically (read: without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>), Amuro is 18, and a military cadet, sent to train with the first Federation Mobile Suits. He still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">falls into the cockpit</a>, but at least he's officially sanctioned to do so.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV">OAV</a> <em>Endless Waltz</em> is especially inexplicable, with Mariemaia Khushrenada leading a rebellion despite being <em>seven years old</em>. (Granted, she was a figurehead for the most part, chosen entirely for her parentage, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Man Behind the Man</a> was seeing that she got some in-field experience, too. The age of her father Treize would seem to imply he became a father at 17.)
<ul><li> The manga prequel, <em>Episode Zero</em>, goes wild with the trope. Treize was <em>commanding soldiers</em> way back then, one of whom was a 12-year-old Lucrezia Noin.
</li><li> The <em>main series</em> is also entirely guilty. Zech Marquise is a respected colonel within OZ and an master mobile suit pilot at the age of 19, and his equally skilled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> Lucrezia Noin is in charge of OZ's elite pilot training academy at the same age. Treize Khushrenada is the leader of the entire organization at 24. The Gundam pilots, who were only 15 during were stealing mobile suits, fighting in skirmishes, and beating trained mercenaries around that same time; in this case, however, it's a bit more believable, as they are stated to have been trained as fighters since they were in nappies. Vaguely more palatable by the fact they have about as much experience in mobile suits as anyone else; the MS itself is supposedly only about 20 years old in Wing.
<ul><li> Still, by the age of fifteen Wufei <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is already a widower</span>.
</li><li> Most of these unusually young characters <em>look</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">about 5-10 years older than they actually are</a>, so it's only when their ages are pointed out that it seems strange.
</li><li> Lampshaded in episode 40 by Duke Dermail after Relena pulled her epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">Reassignment Backfire</a> making her essentially 'Queen of the Earth Sphere' both in title and in practice. <em>At 15 years old.</em>

Garrod is 15 and already an established mercenary and saboteur, and no one bats an eye at him becoming a combat pilot once it's clear he knows how to operate a Mobile Suit. Kid Sasamille is chief mechanic of the <em>Freeden</em> despite only being 11 (he is explicitly noted to be a child genius when it comes to engineering).

<ul><li> This also basically disappears by the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Zeta 00</a>" season of the show; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">four years</a> pass, this after the first season takes nearly a year, so by then just about the entire cast is at <em>least</em> in their early to mid 20s, which is still slightly young but not at all unheard of for a real-life combat pilot (with a now-huge majority of the cast being near, at or <em>older</em> than 30 years). The only prominent teens even left on-cast are Feldt (who's now 19) and 14-year-old Mileina Vashti, who's the daughter of the chief engineer of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a> and has ostensibly been around this stuff all her life and ardently wants to help out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunny">Bridge Bunny</a>.

Oh, and for some reasons, a group of eccentric aliens have taken to monitoring her, because the world kind of sort of depends on her for unstated reasons. The show's weird like that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>: Ash or possibly any other Trainer who starts his/her quest at age 10. This involves leaving their parents and families to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">travel across the world on foot</a>, facing off against as-yet-untamed monsters with potentially deadly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a>, and camping without a tent in the woods like old pros. And Ash's mother sends him off cheerfully with nothing but a backpack full of gear and a reminder to keep his underwear washed. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation">Japanese novels</a> actually go into a bit of detail about this, explaining that A) 10 years old is considered the <em>age of adulthood</em> in the Pokémon world - with all of the legal implications that entails, and B) Ash's mom was a young mother who wanted her son out of her life as soon as possible so she could re-capture her youth. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElectricTaleOfPikachu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElectricTaleOfPikachu">The Electric Tale of Pikachu</a></em> mentions in the second chapter that Ash only has a short leave of absence from school while he goes on his journey as he laments how unproductive the first hours of his quest have been.

<ul><li> White owns her own company despite probably only being around 14.
</li><li> In an earlier volume, Falkner is portrayed as a policeman despite most likely being under 18.
</li><li> The most egregious example is Rakutsu (who is based on Nate), who is only 12 years old but is a <em>high-ranking</em> and <em>extremely</em> competent member of the International Police.

They're supposedly in junior high (7th, 8th, 9th grade), although none of ninth graders look that way; one is often mistaken for a teacher. Not to mention how the twelve-year old main character can cream professional adult players without even breaking a sweat. But he can't beat his father, though.
</li><li> 2nd Lt. Alice L. Malvin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors">Pumpkin Scissors</a></em>. Justified as she's a noble out of officer school (in the prologue). She's still in her teens in the series proper, but younger people have fought in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, which the series is a blatant fantasy analogue of.
</li><li> Ranma Saotome of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> is a world-class martial artist capable of feats impossible for a mere 7th-dan black belt, and he's only 16 at the end of the series. (This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explained</a> by his father Genma's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">slave-driver-esque training regimen</a> and spending Ranma's early childhood <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> as part of the regimen.) He STARTED the series at 16 as well, so that was a busy year.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> tends to be a bit of a shock when we hear Utena is only about 13 or 14 years old, with some other characters not much older, considering what they get up to...
</li><li> The Astronauts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RocketGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RocketGirls">Rocket Girls</a></em> are justified as having been chosen <em>because</em> they are 16-year-old girls and much lighter than adults. Girls have already done most of their growing by age sixteen. You'd be much better off finding adult women with small bones.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari">Saiunkoku Monogatari</a></em>, To Eigetsu not only becomes the youngest person ever to pass the Imperial Examinations and qualify for court office at the age of thirteen, he earns the highest score and is almost immediately appointed co-Governor of an entire province (alongside seventeen-year-old Kou Shuurei). Similarly, by the time he was taken in by the Kou family at the age of fourteen, Seiran had already spent a year infiltrating and destroying a band of criminal mercenaries.
</li><li> A Prequel Manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakigakeOtokojuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakigakeOtokojuku">Sakigake!! Otokojuku</a></em> shows that Edajima is specially admitted in the Tokyo Imperial University at the age of eleven, and he passed the test in such a short time, complete with saying the test is far too easy.
<ul><li> The <em>sequel</em> manga occasionally shows what has become of Otokojuku students some 18 years after their graduation. J is now Chief of Staff of the US Armed Forces, and thus a four-star general, in his early 30s.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheSlayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheSlayers">The Slayers</a></em> has the four main protagonists. Lina in particular is possibly the only sorceress in the world able to manifest the power of the world's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianOfTheMultiverse">Guardian of the Multiverse</a>, the one being above God and Satanic figures Ciefeed and Shabranigdo respectively, the Lord of Nightmares, and utilize it effectively. Her magical level is also noted to be much higher than average. At the start of the series, she's a tender fifteen.
<ul><li> Zelgadis the chimera sticks out even more, depending on the adaptation. He's a hyper-intelligent chimera, able to strategize like a general, utilize effective swordplay and magic, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">use a nautical sextant</a> with ease. Throw in the ability to play the guitar in the anime, and you have an ace of a sorcerer at nineteen (or sixteen, in the anime).
</li><li> Princess Amelia is a well-rounded priestess and an effective healer, not as powerful as Lina, but being a fourteen (anime)/fifteen (novels) year old diplomat is nothing to sneeze at.
</li><li> Gourry is a phenomenal swordsman, but is twenty-two at the start of the series, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that he was a mercenary/soldier since seventeen. Depending on where you live, that's actually not uncommon in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, so he averts this trope to a degree.
</li></ul></li><li> It's something of a stretch for the audience to believe that the now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotRelevantAgeUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotRelevantAgeUp">eighteen years old</a> Christopher Thorndyke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> constructed a fully functioning portal that allowed him to transfer between worlds, gained his pilot's licence and became a black belt in Karate in six years between the end of one series and the beginning of the next. They're all <em>possible</em>, but accomplishing <em>all of them</em> in the same time span (when he was previously little more than an annoying twelve year old) is somewhat more incredible.
</li><li> Most of the main cast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> are 13 - 16 years old. It's pretty impressive for 13-year-old Maka to be so good at slicing through pre-Kishins that she nearly turned her partner into a Death Scythe at the <em>start of the series</em>, the strongest position a weapon can get to (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And later on, she really does manage this.</span>) and later (in the anime at least) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">takes out the world's most powerfully evil being, the Kishin, with a single <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">punch to the face</a></em>.</span>
<ul><li> With Spartoi demonstrating just how 'elite' these teenagers are, Kid's the only questionable example, in that he is not human and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent">'fragment'</a> of Lord Death.</span>

<ul><li> Tea Flatte is one too, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to her being immortal thanks to Merlin's magic.</span>

<ul><li> Seto Kaiba is a sixteen-year-old inventor, pilot, and sole owner of a successful billion-dollar gaming empire (still a stretch even at his dub-raised age of 18); however, how he managed to attain this was a major plot point of the 'Virtual World' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arc">arc</a>.

</li><li> Duke Devlin is also a sixteen-year-old inventor and the owner of a huge gaming store. Not quite on Kaiba's level, but still. Downplayed a fair bit in the manga, where the store is owned by his dad and the game he created is a fair bit lower-tech, but even then, he still seems to have mostly designed and created it by himself.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeforeWatchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeforeWatchmen">Before Watchmen</a></em> also applies this to Ozymandias, who was apparently already a successful businessman with his own corporate building before he hit 20. Since this one wasn't written by Moore, however, its canonicity is debatable; <em>Watchmen</em> proper only indicates that he was active as a <em>superhero</em> by 19, which is more plausible.

In particular, Vincent joins the army at the age of six, and he and Gage become leaders of their own platoons at the age of seven. Disturbingly enough, the horrific implications of this are never explicitly commented on. In a less extreme example, Iris, "the Captain" is only eighteen.

Not to mention it's highly unlikely that some outsider can just show up and suddenly become Alpha (especially as 'Alphas' are just the parents of the pack). But of course the only justification for this is that cartoon animals are typically more civilized and accepting than the real thing.

A raw recruit entered at the age of 7, made Initiate (the rank Lone Wolf has at the beginning of his first adventure) at 16, and completed his training and became a Master at 28. The Grand Master, at the time the highest rank, was anywhere from 56 to 60. Of course, that was the old Order; Lone Wolf would radically shake things up, becoming an Initiate at 15, making Master before 18, and reaching Grand Master at the shockingly young age of 35 (even more shocking when you consider that due to his time in the Daziarn, physically he was just a lick over 23). And even that pales in comparison to his successor in the New Grand Master books, who reached the rank of Grand Master at 14. Although to be totally fair, those previous Grand Masters rose through the ranks by training under other Kai; Lone Wolf did it by finding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacGuffin">magic gems invested with the lore of the higher Kai teachings</a> shaped by the hand of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Crystal Dragon Jesus</a>.

The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Tortall Universe</a></em> has this in general.

He also defuses a war and calls several countries out with controversial information on their activities.
</li><li> There's also Ender and <em>every kid at the Battle School</em>. Ender destroys an entire alien race by the age of 9 or so, and then shortly after, he writes a book and starts a new religion. Not bad for someone who hasn't hit puberty yet. This trope is also basically the whole point of the Battle School.

It also raises questions about Harry's grandparents.

<ul><li> Prue is only mid-twenties in the first season and has already been a successful museum curator and prominent auctioneer. The second one is a little more feasible since the two people who hired her were demons that wanted to kill her - and after they've been dealt with, she's in constant clashes with senior people in the auction house. After leaving that job, she becomes a photographer instead, which she already has experience with (having done it in high school) and does so as a freelancer.
</li><li> Piper straddles the line. In the pilot episode she gets a job at a nice restaurant only a few months after leaving her job as a bank teller. She also quickly becomes a successful nightclub owner before she's even in her thirties - and with the first place she buys too. There is a slight justification with the restaurant job - where the chef who hires her in the first episode abruptly leaves, and she's forced to try and take over his position.
</li><li> Phoebe is something of a slacker in her early life and there are mentions of her studying psychology in college in the first three seasons. She gets a job as an advice columnist purely on a fluke in Season 4 and quickly becomes a local celebrity within a year (helped slightly by having a romance with the paper's new owner).
</li><li> Paige by contrast is a subversion. She's only just out of college and working as an intern social worker (with mentions that she's still paying off student loans). She's promoted to social worker but has to quickly leave the job because she can't handle it.
</li><li> Billie is only twenty (if we take a line where Piper says she's not old enough to drink) and yet has already learned she's a witch, mastered her powers and discovered a hi-tech scrying system with a computer. It's lampshaded when Piper wonders if Billie got help from demons. But she didn't, so the trope still fits. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out she's the sisters' greatest enemy, but she didn't know this</span>.
</li><li> This is lampshaded in the Season 1 finale when Piper meets an old classmate, who is the segment producer of a highly rated cooking show and has a wealthy fiancee.

<ul><li> Routinely occurs in these shows, particularly with replacement characters, where detectives and officers often seem far too young to have achieved their rank. It's common among not-quite-main protagonists, and particularly blatant in the case of female bosses, who are are routinely played by actresses in their late twenties and early thirties. Most often, they look like, well, actresses, thin, pretty, fragile, well made up and well dressed.
</li><li> Compare this to the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SEpathaMerkerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SEpathaMerkerson">S.

However both Cragen and Van Buren are noted to never recieve another promotion in twenty years of appearances when they should be climbing the promotion ladder. Somewhat justified with Cragen however as he has a backstory as a serious alcoholic with a relapse between his L&amp;O and SVU stints and this may have ruined his promotion chances leading him to top out at Captain even around 70. Van Buren is heavily implied to be an a "Do not promote" list after her one attempt to get a promotion resulted in a failed attempt to sue the department for Sexual and Racial discrimination.
</li><li> Cragen on SVU also mentioned a L&amp;O episode in which he helped expose the corruption of a senior officer. He said this nixed his promotion chances.
</li><li> Also Lennie Briscoe who is still only a beat detective in his early 60's during his final appearances. He freely admits Alcohol ruined his earlier career however so a justified trope.

</li><li> He did graduate high school at age <em>12</em>. He even mentions that when he was in college, he wasn't even old enough to drive.
<ul><li> The writers of the show think "Ph.D" and "doctorate" are interchangeable terms, though, as Reid is said to have earned several "Ph.Ds" before the first season, which is to say, by the time he was 23, at the oldest. Unless his years have more days than other people's, it isn't possible, because Ph.Ds require original research projects, and written dissertations, which must be defended before committees, and each one requires coursework, which no university is going to schedule just for one student's convenience, and which must be done <em>before</em> the research project is begun. I don't care how brilliant someone is, you can't make plants grow faster, or rats learn the mazes faster, and there is a physical limit to how long it takes someone to type 300 pages, not to mention a committee of several people each to read those pages. Maybe he has more than one <em>doctorate,</em> an advanced degree that does not require a dissertation, but he does not have multiple Ph.Ds.

</li><li> Well, except in the very first episode, where <em>everyone</em> comments on the fact that Echo is far too young and pretty to be a competent hostage negotiator. Eventually contributing to her partial breakdown.
</li><li> Not to mention Topher, who supposedly is one of the world's best experts on neurotechnology when visibly he is at most in his late 20s. This put him actually as too young to be even a normal neurosurgeon, which requires four years of college, four years of med school and <em>seven</em> years of residency to achieve. Yet somehow Topher manages this super-secret and revolutionary technology despite being a guy who could only be a few years out of grad school at best.

As of season three he runs his own hotel, hosts political election parties and has a grand opening of his new club... and the guy has only just turned eighteen. The club opening episode revolved a lot around acquiring a liquor license, yet the fact that the club owner was not legally allowed to purchase alcohol was never brought up.

A normal intern would be roughly 26 years old but except for Katherine Heigl the other actors were 7-10 years older. Cristina was stated to have had a PhD as well as her MD, so she could have been a bit older but this is mostly a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">the actors playing characters younger than they are.</a>
<ul><li> Addison Montgomery, however, is a straighter example. She's a board-certified OB/GYN (which is a four-year residency) subspecializing in maternal-fetal medicine (three year fellowship). Since she attended school with Derek Shepherd and was mentored by Richard Webber, she likely completed a general surgery residency (five years) and at least a two-year pediatrics residency, and fans are still divided on the order in which she did all that. She's also extremely well-regarded in her field, referred to as "The Meryl Streep of Maternal-Fetal Medicine", indicating that she has been practicing for quite some time. She looks pretty damn good for somebody who, under the best circumstances, should be at least early forties.

At the beginning of the series, she's in the advanced high school class at the age of ten, and is already being offered admissions and scholarships by various universities — her parents keep Janice enrolled in high school <em>only</em> to help foster her social development. Midway through the series (when the character is about 12) Janice departs, having accepted an offer from Harvard to begin studies as a sophomore. She makes a cameo at the conclusion of the series, having been gone for about a year in-universe (the final two seasons took place over a single nine-month school year). By that point, age about 13, Janice has graduated from Harvard and is lining up a job at IBM.

<ul><li> The "ducklings". Given that Cameron and Chase are both stated as 26 in season one and Foreman is 30, they're a bunch of medical prodigies alright. Cameron, an immunologist, would have had to graduate high school roughly at age 14. Foreman, the neurologist, could have gotten that far in his career by 30, but he's also shown as being a neurosurgeon meaning he also would have graduated high school early. Chase is the one who stands out the most though, since aside from being a Trauma specialist and having some form of expertise in pediatrics (meaning he would have graduated high school around age 13) he also spent a few years in seminary training, back when he wanted to be a priest. He must have graduated high school around age 10. However in season two he is aged up to 30.
</li><li> Then add the fact that all three of them have had enough training to not only be capable of performing every medical test known to man, they are also <em>qualified</em> to do them. They must have all graduated high school in the womb.
</li><li> Chase is Australian, and fans have pointed out that he might have been able to get his specific qualifications in a shorter period of time than American doctors, due to the way the Australian medical board is set up.

</li><li> Boone is mentioned as running a part of a large business despite being only twenty-two or so (Ian Somerhalder was twenty-five when the show started). However, he explicitly states that his mother is head of the company and it is quite obvious that he did not earn it through experience.

And this is at a age the youngest CIA intelligence officers would be <em>beginning training</em>.
</li><li> In a less obvious and less egregious case: If you pay attention to the various backstory tidbits dropped for Tony along with his stated age (a little younger than his actor), it works out that he made detective at around age twenty-eight and this is after he most likely got a Masters.

Normally, a psychiatrist would require about 12 years of post-secondary education, meaning they would graduate around the age of 29 before even being able to <em>start</em> their practice. Then, in the reunion movies, it was repeatedly mentioned (and shown in flashback) that Megan was 15 during the Easter weekend of 1971, at which point she was a high school student who had not yet lost her sight. This would have made her <em>22</em> in 1978 — and meant that between '71 and '78 she managed to finish at least two years of high school, then somehow cram 12 years of university into about four, and then establish a busy practice, <em>all while making the adjustment to having unexpectedly gone blind</em>. This uttely ludicrous timeline isn't even a case of multiple writers muddying up continuity; all of Megan's appearances were written by David Chase.

</li></ul></li><li> In real life, one can reasonably expect to start a career in law in their late twenties. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>, on the other hand?
<ul><li> Only four of the attorneys in the original trilogy appear to be out of their twenties: Winston Payne, Marvin Grossberg, Godot, and Manfred von Karma<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7p7tq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7p7tq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7p7tq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While von Karma is much older than any other prosecutor in the series, it should be noted that he went undefeated for 40 years, meaning he started his successful career at the age of 25.</span>. Of course, considering all the other idiosyncrasies of the justice system as presented in the games, ridiculously young attorneys are pretty much par for the course. In some places it's possible to be a lawyer without going through grad school, but really, it's all just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaved</a>.
</li><li> In some characters' cases this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> by saying they went were born/raised/went to school in Germany, that land of remarkably progressive laws and very easy bar exams. Miles Edgeworth debuted at 20, Franziska von Karma debuted at 13, and Klavier Gavin was a lawyer <em>and</em> a rockstar at age 17.
</li><li> Lana Skye was 29 and Chief Prosecutor. Two years before that, she was a highly ranked and very well respected detective who was only getting ready to become a prosecutor in the first place. Also, she is shown wearing 3 Prosecutor of the Year awards, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale">despite being a prosecutor for only 2 years.</a> Simon Blackquill had to have started prosecuting some time before he was twenty-one, when he was arrested, and since his courtroom tactics are so well-known even after seven years in prison, it's likely he started sooner rather than later.
</li><li> The defense attorneys get hit with this trope too. Mia Fey passed her bar exam by the time she was 23, and had her own law office by the time she was 27. Her protege Phoenix joins her at 24. Apollo Justice himself is even younger than Phoenix when he becomes a lawyer (22), but Athena Cykes beats all of them by joining the Wright Anything Agency at <em>18.</em> (Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> by her studying in Europe.) Kristoph Gavin was also famous and well-established by 25. Calisto Yew was 23 when Edgeworth met her, and she'd been practicing law for at least a couple of years. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not that she was actually a lawyer, but nobody seemed to doubt she was one due to age or incompetence.</span>
</li><li> This doesn't just apply to those with careers in law. Adrian Andrews is a 23 year old manager, Ron DeLite, a 22 year old Chief of Security, Valerie Hawthorne was a policeman at 18...
</li><li> <em>Dual Destinies</em> also reveals that there's a law school known as the Themis Legal Academy that teaches students to be attorneys, prosecutors, and judges at high-school ages. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One of the students at Themis is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">actually 25</a>, having been held back repeatedly for seven years. In our world, 25 would still be fairly young for a senior Law student, but everyone in-universe is shocked by how old he is.</span> Considering that Klavier and Sebastian Debeste from <em>Investigations 2</em> are both confirmed alumni of Themis and both began prosecuting at age seventeen, lawyers and judges in their late teens may actually be the norm in the <em>Ace Attorney</em> universe.
</li><li> All of this is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&amp;comic=031614">parodied<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AwkwardZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AwkwardZombie">Awkward Zombie</a></em> strip.

In the Victorian Era.
</li></ul></li><li> While her official age is never given, Lynne was a young girl ten years before the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick">Ghost Trick</a></em> and now she's a full-fledged detective. The only real explanation we get is that Cabanela took her under his wing (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and fudged her exam scores</span>), so he might have made the department take in a younger detective than usual. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, in the final timeline, she doesn't get her exam results fudged this time, and she still passes it, which makes it all even more unbelievable.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> series in general, as a whole. It should be noted that the emotional problems the characters face do seem tied to their actual ages in <em>Final Fantasy</em>, even if their accomplishments aren't. The moody, uncommunicative, trying-too-hard-to-be-a-grown-up Squall of <em>VIII</em> could be no other creature than a 17-year-old from an elite school; the 18-year-old Terra is an adult but still very confused about her identity; the twentysomethings Cloud and Bartz both need to be old enough that their childhood is a distant memory but not old enough to have got over it yet. The glaring exception is Cecil, who reads as way older than 18. Some examples include:
<ul><li> The Light Warriors from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em> may get this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">Depending on the Artist</a> they range from "at least definitely adults" to "ambiguous chibis." The Warrior of Light in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em> at least has the dignity of being one of the older-looking heroes, despite his lack of official age...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em> the most valuable soldiers of the rebel force fighting to stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire">Evil Empire</a>...are teenagers. Justified in that when the game started they were nobody refugees who had to fight even to enlist. There's also, though, the matter of Minwu. He's a courtly wizard. Look at his character art: there's no way he's over 35.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>, <em>every</em> hero is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> turns the blank characters into fifteen-year-olds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Young-looking</a> fifteen-year-olds.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Cecil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Kain</a> lead the dark knights and the dragoons, respectively, at the ages of twenty and twenty-one, respectively. Even taking into account the fact that both of them were likely trained from early childhood, that's still very, very young for their positions. One wonders what the older soldiers think...
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Rydia</a> starts the game at age seven (though she gets aged up offscreen). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins">Palom and Porom</a> are five. FIVE. And their special ability lets them combine their magic to mimic comet, flare and meteo. And they have enough mental resolve to turn themselves to stone to save the world. What did you learn in kindergarten?
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>, main character Bartz is all of twenty, though at least he's nothing more than a vagabond. Faris, however, is the same age and master of a pirate ship.
</li><li> Celes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> is an 18-year-old army general working for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> who burned down a resisting village shortly before the events of the game. The explanation given is that she's a genetically-engineered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a>. And apparently she's taken time off from soldier training to learn how to sing in an opera. Terra is the same age, and is also a frighteningly competent (if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed</a>) soldier-slash-biological-weapon. Although, she isn't human...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, Cloud is the oldest <em>FF</em> protagonist so far (which <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em> makes some mileage out of, treating him as the mature and experienced one of the group). Other characters react to him as an experienced elite veteran. He's <em>21</em>. He joined the military at 14 years old, which appears to be accepted as normal.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em>, Zack becomes a hotshot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">SOLDIER First Class</a> at age 17, while veteran uber-SOLDIERs Sephiroth, Angeal, and Genesis are all only in their early twenties during the majority of the events.
</li></ul></li><li> SeeD from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> serves to deconstruct this somewhat, as most of the prominent positions are held by teenagers. There are many points in the game that stress how these characters are too young for their posts; Quistis is an instructor at age 18 and gets dismissed for lacking leadership qualities, Seifer is also 18 and put in charge of a combat mission where he ignores orders and goes vigilante, Irvine is the same age and set to assassinate a government official - and ends up cracking under the pressure. As the Gardens that trained these soldiers began as orphanages, most have been there since childhood (Quistis mentions training at age 12). There is also the refreshing aversion of Laguna - a soldier out on tour at the age of 27.
</li><li> Top of the list has to be Eiko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> - she's only <strong>six years old</strong> and knows how to cook and take care of herself. Zidane and Garnet are both 16 and Freya is 21. If you weren't told this, you would never know it. They act much older, and have histories and experiences that imply they can't be that young, for example Freya being a member of the Dragon Knights <em>several years ago</em> and Zidane having years of experience as a thief. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">May be justified in that both Freya and Zidane aren't human and hence may age and reach maturity differently.</span> Vivi looks to be about 9, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but the official ultimania guidebook confirms that he was activated SIX MONTHS before the start of the game!. The age of 9 is likely a guess by his adoptive grandfather.</span> Kuja is only slightly better in this regard, being a famed "weapons dealer", rich Treno personality, proprietor of a massive desert palace, and doing all his villain accomplishments at the tender age of 24. Beatrix thankfully is a little more plausible; she's captain of Alexandria's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a> and a feared and respected soldier, aged about 27.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, the prospective High Summoner and saviour of the world is probably about 17 or 18. Her guardians aren't much older, and apparently one gets to be a Legendary Guardian by surviving one pilgrimage and reaching the ripe old age of 35. Lulu and Wakka have also been guardians before and they're only 23 and 24 respectively - Lulu has been a guardian <em>twice</em>. However there is a slight buzz about Seymour becoming the youngest Maester - at the rather more reasonable age of 28. Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that's frequently popping up to destroy parts of the world at random, it's entirely possibly people are lucky to make it to their thirties.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em> has the factions of Spira led by men in their mid-twenties at the oldest. Gippal in fact is the leader of the Machine Faction at only 18. All three of them are war veterans, having been part of the Crimson Squad, so at least they have some form of experience. This is however averted with Isaaru and Tromell, who assume leadership of Bevelle and Guadosalam respectively. Isaaru is 30, and Tromell 56.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> has Vaan and Penelo (both 17) and Larsa, age <em>12.</em> On the other hand, Basch is 36 and Fran is at least 50. Balthier, despite his initial impressions, is only 22. This is somehow old enough for him to have become a <em>Judge</em>, ran away from being a Judge, and then become one of the most notorious sky pirates in the game world. Although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his father made him a Judge and is implied to have pulled a lot of strings and bent some rules to do it</span>, which makes things a bit more palatable. Ashe meanwhile is fighting for control of her kingdom at the age of 19 - though in this case her youth is acknowledged and she does struggle with the pressures that she faces even leading the resistance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em>, where they put all the heroes from the first ten games together and the oldest character ends up being <em>21</em>! Which makes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">particularly odd</a> to see 17-year-old Squall acting as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Bartz</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Zidane</a>, when Bartz is <em>older than Squall</em> and Zidane is only a year or two behind him at most.
<ul><li> The youngest of them all is cute little Onion Knight, he doesn't have a stated age, but the general consensus is the ripe old age of <em>12</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em>, the protagonist are school kids, while the people who's in combat in Ivalice are older than them.
</li><li> Somewhat justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> - by reading the magic book, the kids, especially <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mewt</span> all played a part in <em>creating the world of Ivalice</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium">by making it like a</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium">game they all played</a>, so it wouldn't be surprising that they are all able to participate in the game/world at their current ages, since they would be the protagonists. And <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mewt</span> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> powers</span>, so he would probably be a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> in Ivalice. Besides, everyone aside from Cid and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Remedi</span> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">Vague Age</a> anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestV">Dragon Quest V</a></em> starts off the protagonist as <em>six</em> years old. He gets treated as such, and it shows in other things such as being unable to read signs, but this obviously does not stop him from donning Plate Armor and wielding a Broadsword to considerable effect.
</li><li> Though never outright specified, many of the commanding officers in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a></em> series look like kids, or teenagers at best. Fittingly, the series treats war more like a game than an armed struggle.
<ul><li> <em>Days of Ruin/Dark Conflict</em> mostly averts this trope and justifies the few cases that come along: Will/Ed is a trained army cadet and is forced into a leadership position because the troops respect him more than they do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">Lin</a>, while Penny/Lili, Tabitha/Larissa and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Isabella/Cathleia</span> are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">tyke bombs</a> designed to be army commanders.

In the second game, 23-year-old Mira chides the male Exile for hitting on her and being too old.
<ul><li> Bastila's Battle Meditation is the central power responsible for the Republic's ability to battle the Sith, but the most liberal estimates of her age place her in her early twenties. She is, however, the only Jedi alive with her ability. The game acknowledges her age in several ways: she's still a padawan and there are repeated comments to the effect that in peacetime they wouldn't let her outside the enclave without a Master to watch her back. Plus her other abilities <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled">kinda suck</a> becuase her training emphasised her unique abilities ahead of combat skills.
</li><li> Averted in the second game in the series: Mira, the youngest member of the party, is commonly estimated to be around twenty. The Exile (the player) is a war hero[ine], and is generally agreed to be in his/her late thirties or early forties.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Chris Avellone</a> puts the ages of Visas, the Disciple and the Handmaiden at 25, and Mira at 23. Considering all the highly accomplished young people out there, the Star Wars universe must have a brutal learning curve.

<ul><li> All of the Cobras are an inversion, if they were in their twenties and thirties during World War II, then they would have to be in their forties and fifties during the events of game. Of course, The Boss is a straight example as she was born in 1922. The Cobra Unit was formed in 1941, with her serving as its commander from its formation until the end of the war, meaning she started the war as a special ops commander at 19 and ended the war at 23. This of course has creepy connotations when you consider her relationship with The Sorrow...
</li><li> Ocelot, who was a GRU major at 20. He was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raised as a spy by the Philosophers</span>, which makes it a bit more believable.

As Snake was born in 1972 he would have at most been 19 years old during the war; the age requirement for even being eligible to join the US Special Forces is 20 years old, meaning that Snake would neither be a full member of the Green Berets nor would he even be past basic training. This isn't even getting into the fact that Snake later goes on to join FOXHOUND, which is an analogue for the Delta Force, and is noted to be the most advanced Special Forces Unit America has to offer, at age 23. Snake even defeats Big Boss, the most legendary soldier in the world at 23, and proceeds to defeat Big Boss again at 27. By the time of Shadow Moses Snake is a legendary special ops soldier who has gone on countless missions of extreme national security importance — by the time he was 33, and in fact by that point he had been in retirement for a few years. It says something very poignant and tragic about Snake's life that during a time in his life were most other people are going to college, getting married, or finding stable jobs, he was out saving the world in top secret black ops.
</li><li> Big Boss himself is a case of this. Though it should be noted that Big Boss's age has been retconned twice, so while his earlier backstories were not a case of this his current one is. Going by the current canon backstory set by Peace Walker Big Boss was born in 1935, making a great deal of his career improbable and close to outright impossible. He met The Boss (the aforementioned legendary World War II hero) at age 14 and was her apprentice for the next 10 years of his life (1949-1959). Joined the Army at 15 in order to fight in the Korean War, and joined the Green Berets during their formation as a unit in 1952 at 17. In 1964 Big Boss joins the highly elite and top secret unit known as FOX (the precursor to the FOXHOUND unit Solid Snake was a part of) as its original ace operative, at age 29. In the same year, Snake infiltrates Soviet territory to hunt down rogue Russian operatives to prevent a nuclear war, and in the aftermath of the mission's success is awarded the title of Big Boss in order to mark him as The Boss's successor. Additionally Big Boss is given command of the FOX Unit, which he would have to be a ranking officer akin to a Colonel or a General to even be able to touch the authority reigns of such an important unit. Founds the successor organization to FOX, known as FOXHOUND, and becomes its commanding officer at age 36, and please note that one would have to be extremely lucky to be at the appropriate military rank to lead such a unit at that age. Later on during the 80s, when Big Boss resumes his role as commander of FOXHOUND, when at this point Big Boss is in his 50s, his command role in relation to his age begins to become more plausible.
</li><li> The little girl Sunny trumps all of them. Introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em> the daughter of Olga is a genius level intellect capable of tinkering with advanced computer technology and robotics on par with the level of Otacon, Snake's resident technology expert, at <strong>7 years old</strong>. Things are hardly much better in Metal Gear Rising, where at age 11 she is the employee manager of a space exploration corporation that designs highly advanced aircraft technology, and in addition she has made several aircraft designs of her own while working for the company. Raiden even gets to ride around in an experimental aircraft that she personally designed and helped build that can fly at Mach 30.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a></em> games take this to a new level. Both games would feature one or two Loli characters, with Improbable Weapons to boot, and still have them go into battle fought by men in their thirties (The Two Qiaos, Oichi in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a> 1 and Gracia, I'm looking at you all.)
<ul><li> Especially blatant in the case of the Qiaos, who, historically, were <em>older</em> than Sun Shang Xiang.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata">Eternal Sonata</a></em>, one of the regular party members is Beat, a street kid who is...wait for it...only eight years old. He seems to have little problem shooting and mercilessly beating enemies, but once expressed worry that he would wet his pants in fear while crossing a high bridge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> Link is already a master of multiple weapons, including bows, bombs, boomerangs, and swordplay, as well as a few magic spells in some games, but then you take into account that in many games he's no older than 12 years old. Justified. Everything except the bow and sword are completely new or exceedingly rare weapons, so <em>no one</em> is a master, making Link's (limited) ability the best there is with none able to counter. His sword is explicitly stated to be magical (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">sentient</a>), and his frequent left-handedness likely gives him a considerable learning-curve advantage. His bow also fires magical arrows.
</li><li> There's also Tetra from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em>, who is the captain of a pirate ship despite being a preteen girl. This is lampshaded by one of her crew members, who jokes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">she's actually 35</a>.
</li><li> Link's skill is also justified in another way. In each game he is the latest reincarnation of the original hero, and with each generation he retains the skills of the former generations. Add that to how in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em> Link was a trainee in a knight academy (albeit one with no enemy nation's or intense monster threats until the start of the game) it makes sense Link would be at least good enough in most weapons to do what he does in game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tetra is also justified in the same way, being the latest Zelda, and so a natural leader</span>
</li><li> The craziest example is Malo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>. He looks no older than two but talks in complete sentences, walks fine on his own, and runs a successful item shop in Kakariko village; official media pins his between four and eight. Malo also manages to run a successful fundraising project to rebuild the East Bridge of Castle Town, (although he had help from the Goron elders with this one) and run a second fundraiser to buy the snooty overpriced store in Castle Town for only 200 rupees. For reference, the cheapest item there before the buyout is 10,000 rupees.
</li></ul></li><li> Both subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a></em>, where Julius Belmont is over fifty years old and still a force to be reckoned with, and played straight, as he was 19 by the time he <em>killed Dracula</em>.
<ul><li> The 19 years old thing is not unusual for the Belmont clan, considering Richter did it, and most Belmonts are only a few years older at most. If anything, Juste was YOUNGER, at 18. Julius is notable for being fifty years old by the time of the Sorrow titles, and yet still being able to kick ludicrious amounts of ass, impressive for a guy who hasn't been working out for three decades. Consider, each generation of the Belmont clan is stronger than the last. Besides Reinhardt Schneider, the last full-blood Belmont was Ritcher, and that was 202 years before Julius went into action in 1999. Think about it.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SSX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SSX">SSX</a></em> games, many of the competitors are just teenagers, with Kaori Nishidake at only 17 in <em>SSX 3</em>... but Griff Simmons takes the cake by only being <em>eleven years old</em>. To be fair, this seems slightly less unlikely when you realize he was based on Ryan Sheckler, who won gold at the X-Games in real life when he was only 14.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>, it's possible for your character to start out at as young as 16 (you can select your age to start; it affects pretty much nothing). Considering that all the screwing, murdering, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">driving</a> the character can do, they probably figured sixteen was the absolute youngest they could go.
<ul><li> Considering its a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-apocalyptic setting</a> where no one would probably care about things like mandatory education, minimal age for drinking, driving, weapon-handling, etc. because you need to learn how to survive, it's kind of justified.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, your character is 19 years old but your initial skills are explained by things like your father giving you a BB gun when you're 10, having to deal with a gang of bullies, your father teaching you medical skills, etc. Also, like above you're in a lawless wasteland, so the drugs and such make sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has a purely cosmetic age slider that can make your character look between 20-ish and middle aged. This means that it's possible for The Courier to go from being a package courier to supreme ruler of the Mojave Wasteland in their mid 20s. And that's not counting the things you do in the 4 add-ons.

She may be a gene-boosted human, but that's still impressive.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> games, Enzan/Chaud may not be <em>quite</em> as accomplished as his anime counterpart, but he's still a high-ranking Official NetBattler who gets a lot of important missions... only to be shown up by the equally young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> Lan, of course. He also skips a lot of grades, to the point where he's starting college when Lan's in sixth grade.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia1">Grandia</a></em>: The protagonist, Justin, is 14 his best friend Sue is 8 and the experienced adventurer Feena is 16.

It <em>does</em> get out of hand in the third game when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's made a member of the Admiralty Board</span>, though. On the other hand, she's 26 or so by the time she's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">promoted to admiral</span>, and she doesn't think she's really qualified. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She never actually commands ships in battle, either; it's more of a political appointment and it's explicitly stated that she only got it because she was both the daughter of the previous admiral and had the most experience fighting geth (thanks to teaming up with Shepard in the previous two games) of any quarian in the fleet.</span>
<ul><li> Also Mordin Solus's nephew, who is a tenured professor at the age of 16. This is justified as his species has an average lifespan of about 40, making him the equivalent of a human in their mid-30s.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Certainly <em>Pokémon</em> is famous for this, given that you generally take down a criminal syndicate as an eleven year old, but they continue it in Gen. IV with Cyrus. He's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the Sinnoh region, has a legion of minions, uncovered legends and science that show how to ascend to godhood, solves one of the biggest questions the fanbase had had (see his report about Poke Balls hampering power), has made more money than he knows what to do with, and did I mention he's stated directly to be twenty-seven years old? And it gets better—an agent comments that they haven't gotten a promotion in five years. Barring an unspoken previous leader, Cyrus had the team up and running by the time he was TWENTY-TWO. Although there's an in-game reason given for this: he was pressured from a young age to be perfect, and it's said to have caused his mental breakdown. Think about that next time you battle fourteen-year-old Red, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who's already become a hermit</span>.
</li><li> The spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest">Pokémon Conquest</a></em> actually lampshades this, Mori Motonari mentions the protagonist is much younger than he expected, and starts to wonder whether he's the old guard on his way out. (Judging by his looks, he's in his twenties at the very most).
</li><li> As mentioned, the protagonist is this. Trainers spend decades becoming powerful trainers yet the protagonist, who is eleven at youngest and never over eighteen, defeats criminal organizations and becomes champion despite just receiving their Pokémon. A few other powerful trainers are similarly young, like Iris or your rivals.

<ul><li> Not only is Mario a plumber, but he's also has been an accomplished carpenter, construction worker, referee, go-kart racer, tennis player, fighter, physician, pilot, painter, Olympian, and certified MD all at the age of 26 (or in some cases, manages to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackofAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackofAllTrades">Jackof All Trades</a> at 24)! The same can be said for Luigi who has also done just as much, if not all the things on the aforementioned list. That said, in our universe it takes about two-five years for plumbing apprenticeship training; as for being a certified doctor, it takes up to four years to earn a medical degree. In the Mushroom Kingdom universe, the vast majority of "medical practice" that Mario does is throw pills at viruses via <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em> style and make sure the colors match up.

In fact, assume they're around 15 if you don't see them here: Charmy and Cream (6), Marine (7), Tails (8), Amy (12), Sonic (15), Knuckles (16), Rouge and Big (18), Vector (20), and Vanilla (unknown, mother of Cream).

Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">the game says his age is unknown</a>, for comparison's sake, Rune is twenty-four, though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having the memories of the greatest of Espers lodged in his head does make judging his functional age a bit dodgy</span>.

Same for his teammates Falco Lombardi and Slippy Toad, who are respectively 19 and 18 years old - although Slippy actually manages to look and sound <em>twelve</em> at most. This was only after the series reboot though; their official age in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starfox1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starfox1">first game</a> made more sense (Fox was 25, Falco was 28 and Slippy was 19).

He's a hero who defeated Lucifer and his horde and saved the kingdom all by himself, potentially before hitting puberty. (This also makes the option to marry your own adoptive daughter much less questionable.) And then there's also the things your daughter can accomplish before hitting eighteen, and the various endings (court mage, queen, queen of <em>Hell</em>)...

It quickly becomes clear that she's more than competent enough for her job, and given the situation New LA is in, they can't afford to not take advantage of every able engineer they can get. Played a little more realistically in that Lin is noted in-universe to be an exceptional genius (she is the only under-18 character <em>in the entire city</em>), and she's far from perfect, making a number of big mistakes in her primary project that almost cause the whole thing to get scrapped. Her emotional maturity is also rather lacking: she's the first to make impulsive, irrational decisions, and she doesn't keep a lid on her negative emotions and stress as well as most of the adult characters do.

Gary told that to go hang, and became the leader of the Nosferatu in Los Angeles, and one of the major power-players in the city, instead.
<ul><li> LaCroix is also young for a Camarilla prince (one hundred eighty is no spring chicken, but not Elder by any standard of the millennia-old Camarilla), especially given the size and potential power of his domain.

</li><li> Artur Rimbaud is one of the most acclaimed poets of the 19th century. His first poem was published when he was 15, and he completely gave up creative writing at the age of 20. Rimbaud went on to live for 17 more years, dying at 37, but he wrote no more poetry during those years.
</li><li> Brazilian writers Rachel de Queiroz and Clarice Lispector. The first published her novel <em>O Quinze</em>, one of the most important books on Brazilian literature, when she was 20. The latter, who had books published all over the world, including places such as China and Vietnam, and was once called "the Brazilian Franz Kafka" by translator Gregory Rabassa, published her first book, <em>Near the Wild Heart</em>, when she was 23...and wrote it when she was 19.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> was a young person's revolution in general, with most of the leaders being in their early-to-middle 30s. The most striking example is Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, elected to the National Convention at the age of 25, having a political career of two years during which time he wrote the Constitution, administered the government with other members of the Committee of Public Safety and served as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">The Political Officer</a> for the Army of the North taking it from defeat to victory after severe setbacks. He died at the age of 27!
</li><li> Napoleon was a subaltern officer at 16 and a Brigadier General at 24 (his studies at the École Militaire took only a bit longer than 1 year). During the Age of Enlightenment, skills and knowledge were held dear by the ruling elite, but they were still expensive to acquire for ordinary people, so anyone who rushed himself through school was needed and they would turn a blind eye to small faults like "he's too young". Napoleon initially didn't have opportunities in the French military because of his Corsican heritage but during the year of 1793-1794 when the Committee of Public Safety was aggressively reforming the army, he like many others found an opportunity thanks to the meritocratic policy of the army.
</li><li> Alexander the Great. Conquered most of the known world in his late teens and died just shy of 33.

</li><li> At 20, Augustus was already a triumvir, one of the three most powerful men in Rome.
</li><li> In his twenties Pompey gained the command of three legions, made successful campaigns in Sicily and Africa, and gained his first triumph. He also became consul when he was, by law, several years too young. It was amazingly impressive at the time.
</li><li> Scipio Africanus saved his father's life with a heroic charge at the age of 17, was given command of all Roman armies in Hispania at the age of 24, and became consul and defeated Hannibal (widely considered one of the greatest generals EVER) by the time he was 31.
</li><li> According to oral tradition, Sundiata Keita was only 18 when he founded the Mali Empire.
</li><li> Joan of Arc never got out of her teens at all; she was about sixteen or seventeen when she led the French to a series of victories against the English — and managed to do this without even the advantage of being of noble birth or male.
</li><li> Royal Navy Midshipmen did start off at age 12 or so. They could be expected to command men, men 20 years older, as needed, being in the chain of command. This hasn't changed that much in some ways. Officers in their early twenties nominally outrank senior NCOs probably old enough to be their fathers, or sometimes mothers these days, though for the first couple of years they're still considered to be in training and don't have much in the way of real authority. Alleviated somewhat in that officers are supposed to specialize in knowing what to do, and NCOs are supposed to specialize in knowing how. Hence the old saw about the three words that will make a lieutenant into a General being "Carry on, Sergeant."
</li><li> Speaking of the UK Armed Forces, they're one of the few countries who still accept sixteen-year-olds as enlisted recruits, though one has to be over eighteen to be deployed overseas. There's been some talk of raising these limits due to some worrying reports about younger soldiers being more vulnerable to PTSD.
</li><li> War tends to do this. The average age of the entire US Armed forces in WWII was 26, but there were entire units where no one (up to and including the CO and senior noncoms) was older than 30. Improbable age promotions mostly tended to happen in specialist units like the commandoes, paratroopers, and air forces where being young enough to withstand the physical demands was an asset; the youngest U.S. General in World War II was 36 year old paratrooper James "Jumpin' Jim" Gavin. And sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldPromotion">Field Promotions</a> just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">happen to stick after the battle.</a>
<ul><li> WWII editorial cartoonist Bill Mauldin acknowleged this in "Uncle Willy", a cartoon showing a youthful Captain embracing his uncle, a middle-aged infantry private.
</li><li> Revolutions amplify this; while this happened from time to time under the ancien régime, with Rocroi being won by a 21-year-old duke of Enghien (a member of the house of Bourbon), Napoleon himself was 24 when he became a general, gained command of the Italian theater of war at 25 and was 27 by the time the Italian campaign ended. Some of his marshals were equally young when they became generals in the republic; about half of them were colonels in their 20s, general officers at 30 or so, and the youngest of the marshals, Davout, got the baton at 34.
</li><li> Towards the end of World War 1 boys as young as 13 were being enlisted into the army in the U.K because they were running short of draft-age men who could be spared from their civilian jobs. (To put it in perspective, out of approximately twenty million male British citizens at the time, five and a half million had been drafted and one million had been killed in action by the end of the war.) Offically the age limit was 18, but the recruiters didn't have the luxury of asking too many questions.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> is an interesting case: In WWI he was quickly promoted from Lieutenant to full Colonel and placed in command of the entire US Tank Corps. (His demotion after the war ended was even quicker but they gave him a capitaincy as a consolation prize.) He'd only just made his way back to Colonel by the time WWII broke out but once the US entered the war he was once again quickly promoted (over the heads of many more senior officers) to command Allied forces in Europe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyConnolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyConnolly">Billy Connolly</a> did a bit on about a 22 year old Feng Shui expert; "When you're twenty-two you're not an expert on any-fucking-thing!"
</li><li> Not as incredibly young as most on this page, but Thomas Fairfax became the senior officer in command of the Parliamentarian army during the Three Kingdoms Wars (British Civil Wars) at the tender age of 33. Admittedly the war was conducted largely by people with no prior experience of warfare so anyone talented enough would rise high quickly. It helped that he was also politically acceptable and convenient, less politically minded and more malleable than his elder subordinates Henry Ireton and Oliver Cromwell.
</li><li> William Pitt the Younger was Prime Minister of Britain at the age of 24. It probably helped that his father previously held the position, but this didn't stop him losing a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons on account of his age, and ignoring it. He would eventually stay Prime Minister for the next 18 years.

When he began to write <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar">On War</a></em>, he mused that out of 26 years of life by that point, he had spent more than 11 doing war and nothing more.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> became so desperate for soldiers by the end of the war that they had children who hadn't yet reached puberty put on the front lines.
</li><li> Adolf Galland commanded Luftwaffe's fighter force at the age of 29.
</li><li> Rob Bottin became a movie special effects artist when he was 14.
</li><li> Buster Merryfield only began acting when he reached retirement age, and went on to become a main character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses">Only Fools and Horses</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a> was 24 when he directed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane">Citizen Kane</a></em>, arguably the greatest movie of all time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobClampett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobClampett">Bob Clampett</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankTashlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankTashlin">Frank Tashlin</a></em> were 23 when they became cartoon directors.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://time.com/4277590/whole-foods-bees-lemonade/">Mikaila Ulmer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> started up her own brand of lemonade, BeeSweet Lemonade, based off of a family recipe that called for honey and flaxseed as sweetener. She appeared on Shark Tank, got a $60 000 investment, and got her lemonade sold at Whole Foods. <em>She's eleven years old.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> driver Max Verstappen won his first race at the age of 18. The next youngest, Sebastian Vettel, was <em>21</em> when he won his first. Max also holds the record for the youngest driver to test a Formula One car in history. His first test came <em>just three days</em> after his 17th birthday.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldRallyChampionship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldRallyChampionship">World Rally Championship</a> driver Kalle Rovanperä won his first podium under the top-level WRC category at the age of 18, and if he manages to score his first rally win in the 2020 season, he would dethrone current record-holder Jari-Matti Latvala, who took his first WRC win at the age of 22.
</li><li> In many hereditary monarchies there have been instances where teenagers, children, and even infants ascended to the throne, although regents would actually govern in the underage monarch's name until they came of age.
<ul><li> Poor <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_I_of_France">John I of France<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lived for a mere five days after he was born (November 1520, 1316), but he was still technically King of France during that time.
</li><li> Legend has it that Shapur II of Persia (309-379) was crowned while still in his mother's womb.
</li><li> King Tutankhamen, better known as King Tut, became pharaoh at the age of nine. He ruled for around nine more years before dying.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimShooter">Jim Shooter</a> sold his first stories to DC Comics when he was just 13 years old.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudieMurphy">Audie Murphy</a> earned the Medal of Honor when he was 19.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonKorman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonKorman">Gordon Korman</a> published his first book when he was 14.
</li><li> Figure skaters are generally this, starting training as small children and competing their way up from the juniors to senior-level skating, and retiring at an age when most people are thinking seriously about their career. However, from the men's singles discipline we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuzuruHanyu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuzuruHanyu">Yuzuru Hanyu</a> as an extraordinary example: Since he began skating at the age of 4, he's racked up 12 gold medals (including 2 consecutive Olympic ones), 19 broken world records (many of which are his own), become the first skater to successfully land a quadruple loop in competition and is gunning for the quadruple axel (a highly difficult jump which no one has landed in competition) in addition to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">quintuple</a></em> jump, to the pride and exasperation of his coaches/fandom - as he's gotten enough injuries to make a physiotherapist cry, and been in surgery (during which he found out he's allergic to alcohol) after a crash with Yan Han. He's the first male singles skater to achieve a Super Slam, having won all major competitions in his senior and junior career. He's been awarded with medals and honors from the Japanese government as well. At the age of 25 (at this time of writing), he's considered one of the best, if not <em>the</em> best in figure skating history, a consummate skater who combines technique and artistry, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> to his competitors (especially people who have to skate directly after him in a competition).
