A good way to expose a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> is to show how they treat the staff when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">no one who matters is around</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>'s Ciel Phantomhive treats his house staff well, despite the fact the majority of them appear to be useless (at least at first). Alois from the anime's second season however... couldn't be further from this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>: Seto Kaiba is an interesting variant in that he treats the people who work at his company with cold, polite professionalism. By his standards, this is being downright civil, as he's a complete and total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to everyone else except his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">little brother Mokuba</a>. (Though it is only true in the Japanese dub. In the English dub, he's just as rude to them as he is to everyone else.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nana">Nana</a></em>, when Sachiko learns that Shouji's girlfriend Nana (nicknamed Hachi) is at the restaurant they both work at, she drops the plate she was carrying. Hachi, who wasn't even at the table Sachiko was serving, gives her a handkerchief since she cut herself. Sachiko is heartbroken <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because Shouji is cheating on Hachi with her and nearly breaks up with him because of how guilty she feels. Instead, Shouji breaks up with Hachi</span>.
</li><li> One chapter of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em> manga has Tamaki scandalized when he sees a patron of a restaurant demand that a waiter be fired for dropping food on her. He is about to complain when his father stops him, telling him it's not his place. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnclePennybags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnclePennybags">the kind of guy he is</a>, though, Tamaki's father personally sees to it later that the waiter doesn't lose his job.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has Sayoko Shinozaki, who was Milly Ashford's maid until Lelouch and Nunnally entered the picture, at which point she was assigned to help take care of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">blind, paraplegic</a> Nunnally. Everybody treats Sayoko very nicely, especially Nunnally, and thus she's very loyal to them even though she ends up helping Zero and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> (though she does try to protect the kids when all hell breaks loose in the season finale). In the second season, when Zero unmasks for Sayoko and reveals himself as Lelouch, her reaction is brief surprise followed by a satisfied smile, and after that she becomes his personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>.
</li><li> Both Kail and Yuri from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em>. On one hand, Kail handpicks servants who prove themselves to be loyal, and more or less considers them his closest friends. On the other, Yuri views her maids as her best friends and trusts them with everything; in fact, while on a visit to Egypt, the other maids are shocked that she doesn't demand one of them be whipped or starved for spilling water on her dress.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, both Miho and Maho Nishizumi are friendly and courteous to the Nishizumi family maids. They are in turn more than willing to talk with Miho about her troubles. When Miho and her friends are troubled over Maho suddenly acting quite aloof and cold after their mother's return, Kikuyo begs them not to blame Maho, saying that Maho is burdened with many things as Nishizumi heiress, indicating a considerable amount of personal respect and sympathy for Maho, as well as possibly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">knowing that Maho strives to be a good heiress so that Miho can live the way she wishes</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, the second pilot reminisces how his father would routinely harass waiters and send the food back for imaginary faults just to see them squirm. The kid actually considers this manner of power play <em>admirable</em> and wants to emulate it. Tellingly, the kid is a utter sociopath who delights in the death and destruction caused by him taking the fight to a heavily populated area, since the destruction will mean more business for his father's construction company. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He does not take it well when he ends up crushing his father underfoot.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors">Pumpkin Scissors</a></em>, Alice is kind to the working class and common man despite being born into high nobility. When one of her peers threatens to fire a chef for using cheap nuts in his dish due to shortages, Alice steps in and offers to hire the poor chef.
</li><li> While Kaguya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> can occasionally be needy and ungrateful, she values her bond with her maid Hayasaka above all others (even her relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality">Shirogane</a>) and views her as a sister in all but name.
</li><li> Greed's philosophy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> is that he should always treat those who work for him with extreme kindness and respect. Since he's, well, <em>Greed</em>, he wants <em>everyone</em> to want to work for him, and he reasons that the smartest way to accomplish this is to make the working conditions great - if his subordinates think well of him, they'll tell other people how good they have it so they want to get in on the action.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit">Katarina</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyNextLifeAsAVillainessAllRoutesLeadToDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyNextLifeAsAVillainessAllRoutesLeadToDoom">My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!</a></em> treats everyone as her equal regardless of their social status, in part because her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastLifeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastLifeMemories">Past-Life Memories</a> as a Japanese schoolgirl means that she doesn't really consider herself to be nobility. There are even several side chapters devoted to how she ended up improving the lives of members of her household's staff just by being a good person. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Her late grandfather was also stated to have been this way</a>.

<ul><li> In the first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a></em> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> series, Aquaman stops by a seafood restaurant to have a meal and is attended by a waitress who apologizes to him after rambling for a second about her hectic life, including putting her two kids through college, though mainly she apologizes for looking a bit ragged instead of presentable for a customer. Of course, this being Aquaman ordering a meal at a seafood restaurant, he attracts a lot of attention from other customers, who bug him about several things. Eventually he gets annoyed and leaves without eating his meal, giving the waitress two golden doubloons rather than actual money. When she asks what she's supposed to do with those, his reply is a casual, "Put your kids through college." The first issue of his <em>Rebirth</em> comic has him stopping by the same restaurant to eat and is tended to by the same waitress, their dialogue showcasing how well they get along.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> Bruce Wayne is usually depicted as treating Wayne Enterprises employees fairly and acting as a kind, if absent-minded boss, as well as spearheading a great deal of charity work out of a genuine interest in the welfare of Gotham City. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Being raised by his butler</a> likely influenced him in this manner.
<ul><li> This is especially obvious in one issue towards the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BruceWayneFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BruceWayneFugitive">Murderer/Fugitive</a></em> arc which covers Bruce reintegrating himself with his day-to-day life after an extended period away. He knows the names of every employee (even the mail boy who he reminds about Wayne Enterprises college programs) and every employee treats him as a genuinely well-liked, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWonka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWonka">if eccentric and slightly dim</a>, employer.
</li><li> Most of the Bat Family are also like this, except for Damian, towards Alfred. Everyone tends to treat him like a friend doing them a favor whereas Damian keeps their relationship to master and servant, calling him Pennyworth and giving orders rather than making requests. He's not mean (well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">he kind of was to start with</a>, but he's mellowed since then), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">he's just not got much in the way of social skills</a> and keeps the relationship professional. A key point in Damian's relationship actually has him saying "thank you" to Alfred. He eventually <em>does</em> start being nice to Alfred, although he's playful enough for some teashing, like using Alfred's head to jump off.

Of course, this doesn't stop him from being a complete bastard in other respects; however, Lex is a very complex character when it comes to this trope. He appreciates honest, hard work, since he himself comes from a working-class background, and as much of a villain as he is, he's not lying when he says that he has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">ultimate well-being of humanity in mind</a>. HE should be the one in charge, but as long as he has that, he does try to give those under him better lives. Lex has a good understanding of how economics work, so he knows that his financial empire is supported by average joes working blue-collar jobs.

</p><ul><li> All <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> have great respect for their butler Jarvis (another Stark employee, by the way), naming him an honorary Avenger. We most often see this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>.
<ul><li> Another Cap example: there is a story told bit by bit to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilaritySues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilaritySues">accountants trying to tally up the damages after a superhero fight</a> by the various Avengers involved in said fight. Some Avengers are rude, some of them annoyed, some cavalier, Thor just hands over a bag of gold, and Cap Cap hands over filled-out paperwork for the ticketed Quinjet (including the badge number of the officer who wrote the ticket) and the voucher for removing property from a prison. The accountants love him.
<ul><li> Another Cap one, from the beginning of the <em>Civil War</em> arc: Cap breaks out of SHIELD's helicarrier by commandeering a jet fighter (including pilot) through the simple expedient of clinging on to the cockpit. Being Cap, he orders the pilot to set down in a not-in-use football stadium and takes them out for a burger, after admonishing one for taking the Lord's name in vain.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In Marvel's New York City, restaurant and hotel owners and staff know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">Hercules</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">loud, demanding,</a> and at times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOfTheParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOfTheParty">overly flamboyant</a> customer, but they don't care; he's also a <em>huge</em> tipper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>: Similarly, Tony Stark has usually been written as a near-perfect boss who inspires tremendous personal loyalty. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Obadiah Stane</a> stole Stark's company out from under him, most of his employees lined up and quit. (Stark had once used a similar threat to thwart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a>'s hostile takeover.)
<ul><li> This one goes back and forth depending on the writer, the era, and whether Tony is in one of his periodic Jerkass phases.
<ul><li> When Tony blows his top and yells at an employee, he usually has a very good reason. Tony once regretted berating the head of his legal department and resolved to apologize, but that was because the guy was doing such a crappy job as the head of Stark Enterprises' legal team. He was fired a couple of issues later after Tony became fed up with his incompetence.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">The Movie</a>, he's an honestly thickheaded doofus of a boss. But if Pepper is any example, he at least knows the value of a good employee; she does practically <em>everything</em> for him, so he lets her <strong>write her own bonus checks!</strong>
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em>. Frank doesn't cook so he always eats out, and it's easier to maintain a balanced diet if he orders from a menu. However, when he is shown eating out he is always very low-key and tips <em>precisely</em> 15%. Being a high or a low tipper would call attention to himself and make him someone people remember, and his crime fighting activities demand a low profile.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Other</span>
</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a></em> provides a number of examples:
<ul><li> The title character may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">murderous thief</a>, but as long as he's not furious or disguised as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> he's unfailingly polite and respectful to everyone (even if sometimes a bit forceful on people who work for one of his identities), especially his victims (he even complimented the courage of an old woman he had kidnapped to steal her jewels when she <em>openly challenged him to torture her</em> to get the combination to the safe, and didn't harm her in the slightest). This actually bit him back in the ass at least once: he was disguised as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan">Grumpy Old Man</a> but didn't know the man he replaced was a jerk, so he was recognized by some children because he wasn't rude enough;
</li><li> Eva is genuinely nice with everyone, as long as she's not disguised as a jerkass or you didn't gain her wrath (if that happens, just kill yourself). It helps her mother was working class herself and she had to work for a living for a long time;
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Ginko</a> being Ginko, he's genuinely nice and respectful with his subordinates and people in general, but also knows the advantages of acting like that (on one occasion a mob boss managed to get him pissed, and Ginko first shoved him in his own pool and then told him to spare himself from pressing charges, as he had twenty cops who would swear he was somewhere else). His subordinates would do <em>anything</em> for him, including breaking the law (when they're all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop">By-the-Book Cops</a>), killing, and <em>dying</em>;
</li><li> Altea may be a member of the obnoxious nobility of Benglait and a member (by her first marriage) of the much hated royal family of Benglait, but she was always nice to everyone, even working as a volunteer nurse during a terrorism crisis and risking her own life to save her butler (actually Diabolik in disguise to steal some of her jewels) when the revolution erupted and a mob tried to lynch her (when she found it was Diabolik, she offered him the jewels he planned to steal as a thank you for saving her. He refused, but she still covered his tracks). That's why, after the violence of the revolution calmed down, she can now return home when she wants and is literally worshipped by the people;
</li><li> King was unfailingly polite to his subordinates... But only if they lived up to his expectations of them being the best criminals in the world in their chosen field, or at least did a serious effort. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">But if they failed... Well, at least he gave them a quick death</a>. He was Diabolik's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">father figure</a>.
</li><li> Late kingpin of crime in Clerville Natasha Morgan was polite and nice to her men, if a bit forceful and with no exhitation in putting them in danger. This pays off when, after she retires, her bodyguards die to give her a chance to escape King's men (who, being King's men, kill the last one and kidnap her before she can escape);
</li><li> One-shot characters can be easily recognized as jerks when they aren't nice to subordinates and inferiors. This applies to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">criminals</a></em> too, and those criminals who are nice have a better survival rate (that is, Diabolik won't go out of his way to kill them, so they have a small chance of surviving).
</li></ul></li><li> In #26 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendsForever">My Little Pony: Friends Forever</a></em>, Prince Blueblood is shown to follow this kind of thinking, with his diplomatic arsenal including tricks like "befriend the little people around the guy you want to impress, so you'll look good and they'll say good things about you when you're not around." This goes contrary to his fandom perception, which is that of an entitled jerk. Of course, whether he's nice to waiters because he's genuinely nice or just because he wants to look good... is a matter of speculation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich">Richie Rich</a> and his parents are the world's richest people and are nice to the people working for them.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em>, Calvin always gives a rather flattering compliment to his barber no matter how much he dislikes his haircut. ("Never argue with a guy holding a razor," he says.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em>, this is where most of the characters are complete and absolute <em>dicks</em>.
<ul><li> Roger has no concept of an appropriate tip, instead tipping the paperboy with a Shiny New Nickel and then wondering why the paper always ends up on the roof or in the rosebushes. (This is sort of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> for him.)
</li><li> Peter is worse. In one strip, he makes a complex order for a coffee (basically stating one cappuccino without any ingredients), and then pays $5.00 and tells the clerk to keep the change (the amount was $4.97). Peter admits to Jason that he was being annoying, explaining that this was the reason he tipped him. Cue the three pennies being thrown towards Peter's head offscreen.
</li><li> Peter is actually <em>extra</em> mean to his "best friend" Steve when he eats at the pizza place. In one strip, he asks for a pizza that's 499/1000ths pepperoni and 501/1000ths mushroom, and when Steve - who's already busy - brings him a pizza that's exactly half, demands it fixed. (When Jason says Steve is going to spit on it, Pete says, "Steve? No Way! We're buddies!")
</li><li> Jason should talk. He once ordered pizza and requested one with 17/31th cheese, 109/327th sausage, and 86499328/259497984th mushroom. (Roger, who had to pick it up, was given his change all in pennies, and it is implied he will <em>never</em> let Jason order it again.)
</li><li> On the other hand, Paige is such a loyal customer for the ice cream man, <em>he</em> comes when <em>she</em> rings a bell.

</li><li> Many of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Retail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Retail">Retail</a></em> are like this since, being retail workers themselves, they know what it's like to deal with horrific customers.

Sympathetic characters like Flash Sentry or Princess Celestia exhibit it, with helping his butler with chores and forgiving a major social faux pas respectively, while antagonistic characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">Captain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Ironhoof</a> do the opposite.

Flemeth refers to her as "the young lady Warden with the polite tongue in her head." As Alistair notes when talking to Zevran, "it's probably saved our lives more than once." Eventually he learns that this is literally true; Morrigan reveals near the end of the story that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's the only reason Flemeth ever gave for saving Elissa from the burning Tower of Ishal back in Ostagar. She rescued Alistair because he would be needed for the dark ritual, but allegedly, she rescued Elissa purely because the young woman had been polite and respectful to her on their first meeting.</span>
</li><li> Naruto in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10623866/4/">Sekirei?

One bellhop even notes that her tip was more than she makes in a month.
<ul><li> Funny enough, this is part of why the bellhops become convinced he's running a sex slave ring: he's clearly buying them off so they won't tell the police.

As he told Lois Lane, a waitress having a hundred dollars stolen from her might mean she can't make rent or put food on the table, whereas losing twenty million dollars would only irritate Oliver Queen. As such, he mostly sticks to muggings.
</li><li> Harry Potter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ForLoveOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ForLoveOfMagic">For Love of Magic</a></em> might be wildly different from canon, but he's still unfailingly polite to his House Elves and at one point uses one as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> when Narcissa comes to beg his help.
<ul><li> The Malfoys not following this rule comes back to bite them later. In a rage over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his father being killed in a duel</span>, Draco beats their House Elf to death, which Narcissa merely views as unfortunate - since neither of them has any skill at housework. Even when Narcissa secures Harry's support, he refuses to allow them to buy a new House Elf as he won't knowingly put one through such a situation.
</li></ul></li><li> As in the above, Harry Potter/Thorson is always considerate of House Elves and servants in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a>,</em> implied to be partially because of his own abuse at the hands of the Dursleys and partially because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">just that kind of a person.</a>

Lady Tremaine tries to dismiss her as "just an imaginative child", but the normally beleaguered Duke firmly responds, "My orders are <em>every</em> maiden." He then graciously invites Cinderella to sit on a chair and try the slipper.

<ul><li> Unsurprisingly, "Big Daddy" and Charlotte are actually based off of what the Uptown folks were like in New Orleans. Historically speaking, a notable number of them loved the people in the French Quarters (which were slums at the time and not the tourist destination they would become, because of all this) because of how "useful" and hard-working they were. It also helped that they cooked extremely well, and many of these Uptowners would eat in their restaurants, not just because they were cheap, but because they served good French, Italian, and Creole food.

</li><li> The trope runs in both directions in the <em>The Whole [X] Yards</em> films:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWholeNineYards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWholeNineYards">The Whole Nine Yards</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis">Bruce Willis</a>'s hitman with a heart of gold threatened to violently murder the waitress who took his hamburger order down wrong.

</li><li> In the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWholeTenYards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWholeTenYards">The Whole Ten Yards</a></em>, he beats a man senseless for berating his waitress in a restaurant (after, surprisingly, he tries talking to the guy about it calmly), then tells the man's kid to always be kind to people serving you food, and to eat his vegetables.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bullitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bullitt">Bullitt</a></em> features a scene without audible dialogue where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveMcQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveMcQueen">Steve McQueen</a> as Bullitt takes his girlfriend to a Chinese restaurant.

<ul><li> From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricFlint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricFlint">Eric Flint</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo">1633</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's pointed out that, despite having previously been a very negatively portrayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Straw Character</a>  at least before he got handed a navy and a whacking great dose of character development  John Simpson and his wife are greatly respected by the working class people of Magdeburg because of their treatment of their underlings. Despite being a bit of a snob, Mary Simpson is commonly referred to as "The American Lady" because she is unfailingly courteous to her servants, where most 17th century nobles would ignore them completely.
</li><li> Likewise, in the beginning of the same novel, Cardinal Richelieu is noted to be very polite to his servants, repaying loyalty <em>from</em> them with loyalty in return. (Note that series creator Eric Flint said that Richelieu could easily have been an <em>ally</em> of the USE, but he needed someone fiendishly smart to serve as his primary antagonist and Richelieu fit the bill.)
</li></ul></li><li> Mr. Weston doesn't treat Agnes like she's invisible just because she's a governess in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgnesGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgnesGrey">Agnes Grey</a></em>, which is strange for the time and proves his kind character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AncillaryMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AncillaryMercy">Ancillary Mercy</a></em> and the following two books of the trilogy have this trope in spades. Justice of Toren knows what it is like to be treated like a thing instead of a person (strictly speaking, she <em>is</em> a spaceship AI and thus not a person), and treats everyone with respect even though she manages to pass as wealthy (human) foreigner.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AscendanceTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AscendanceTrilogy">Ascendance Trilogy</a></em>, Sage tries to build a rapport with his personal attendant by encouraging him to call him Sage instead of sir and insisting on dressing himself, but only succeeds in making him uncomfortable.
</li><li> In <em>Beastly</em>, one of the signs that Kyle is becoming a better person is that he sees his maid and his tutor as his best friends. Also, the girl he falls in love with worked the ticket booth at prom at the beginning of the book (though he didn't think well of her at the time).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries">Belisarius Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> Weapons designer John of Rhodes is the sort of man who's only rude to his social equals or superiors. There's also Kungas, whose character is revealed to Raghunath Rao when he walks into a room, swiftly assesses where he'll need to post guards, curtly gives his soldiers the orders to post those guards, and then leads them <em>slowly</em> and carefully across the room so they won't scuff the floor a servant was polishing just then. Possibly based on the Prince Albert story in the "Real Life" folder below.
</li><li> When Eon is being evaluated for the position of Emperor by the Axumite chiefs and warriors one of the most important things they ask is how he treated the servant girls. They all knew he was a notorious ladies man and didn't mind terribly; but what they wanted to know is if he had abused them or unduly pressured them because that was considered a sign of how he would treat his people. Eon passed with flying colors; he was intemperate with his servants but not unkind and that was what they wanted to know.
</li><li> When Rana Sanga stormed the Malwa capital, his son Rajiv felt pity on a company of hapless mooks about to be cut up and trampled so he rushed out, announced himself and got them to surrender and swear themselves to his service; and had them all lined up safely out of the way when his father came thundering through the gate. Dad feels both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou">great pride</a> and great amusement.
</li></ul></li><li> In the historical novel <em>Betsy and the Emperor</em>, a British teenager is surprised to note that Napoleon Bonaparte, who is, as far as she's concerned, the scourge of Europe, is fair and decent towards slaves, allowing them to take a rest break before a noble prisoner is allowed the same privilege.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackCrown">Black Crown</a> short story <em>Solace</em>, King Flavius clearly doesn't hold a grudge against the working class; despite referring to the peasants in <em>Schism</em> as 'the mob' and 'stallions to be broken'.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>, one of the signs that Keifer Porter was evil was that he could "barely be civil" with his younger wives, who had no power over him, but always acted sweet with the elder sisters, whom he could easily charm with his beauty. Jerin Whistler being nice to the children is considered proof of his good personality.

<div class="indent"><em>I don't for a moment doubt but that he has his spies among the palace servants, or even the guard. You know the old fox has always made it a point to curry favor with the common soldiers. When he was minister of war he treated them better than he did his officers.</em>

<div class="indent"><em>He was a fine old man, but looked sadly ill and worn. "A crust of bread is what I crave!" he repeated. "A single crust, and a little water!" <br/>"Here's some water, drink this!" Uggug bellowed, emptying a jug of water over his head. <br/>"Well done, my boy!" cried the Vice-Warden.</em>

</li><li> And, in Carroll's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em>, Alice is kind and polite to everyone she meets. This is in contrast to the White Rabbit, who apparently is upper-class enough for a servant, and whom we see speaking rudely to said "servant" (he mistook Alice for her) and later boot-licking the Queen of Hearts.
</li><li> This is taken to extremes in <em>Through the Looking Glass</em>, where the White and Red Queen expect the newly-queened Alice to be so polite as to formally introduce herself to the dishes at her coronation banquet. She obliges for the first few, but eventually refuses on the grounds that they won't let her eat anything she knows personally and she's very hungry.

</li><li> Interestingly conversed and partially averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a>'s <em>Taken at the Flood.</em> An aristocratic wife manages to treat her servants distantly, though politely - she is dependent on them to take care of her, but never pretends to relate to them. Her maids don't hate her for it, though - in fact they're somewhat fascinated by her glamour and difference.
<ul><li> Played straight in Christie's <em>The Secret of Chimneys</em> in which the heroine is established as a good person, despite her somewhat flippant manner, when she asks her chauffeur about his wife's health and offers to pay for a trip to the country if the doctors think it will help her.

</li><li> The Pevensies are kings and queens who treat all of the other beings with respect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy">The Horse and His Boy</a></em>, when Shasta and Bree find Hwin and Aravis, Bree and Hwin talk. Aravis demands to know why he's talking to her horse, not her. Bree points out that as Talking Horse, Hwin has as much right to speak of Aravis as her human. Aravis finds this unsettling.
<ul><li> Similarly, Aravis gets karmic punishment for her lack of concern over a servant: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the servant got a whipping for letting Aravis escape, so Aslan scores Aravis' back with his claws</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Various Calormene nobles are unpleasant to the lower classes, starting with the one who wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">buy Shasta</a>. Archenland's and Narnia's nobles and royalty do much better.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>King Lune:</strong> Never taunt a man save when he is stronger than you; then, as you please.
</div><ul><li> Frank, the first king of Narnia, treated his horse as if it were a close friend. When Aslan made the horse intelligent and able to talk, Frank was thrilled, seeing it as proof that the horse was as smart (and well-bred) as he thought. Then again, Frank was not exactly posh himself, being a London cabbie before his ascension to royalty.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals">Unseen Academicals</a></em>, both Ridcully and Lord Vetinari listen to Glenda, a Night Kitchen cook, reminding us that none of these characters fit any stereotype perfectly. The former is partially because wizards like their food, though he didn't know that she was the one making the incredible pies until about halfway through the conversation. Lord Vetinari talks to her <em>because</em> she's a cook—she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">Sugarbean</a>.
</li><li> It's noticeable that Ridcully tends to be a lot nicer to the serving staff than he is to his fellow professors, possibly because he grew up in the Ramtops (at least, he spent a good many summers in Lancre). People in Lancre don't accept notions of class and rank meaning you can be rude to people.
<ul><li> It's probably also a commentary on the fact that he was originally appointed Archchancellor because after he finished school he went to live in the country, and they were expecting a bucolic halfwit who wouldn't make waves; he has shown a tendency to repay respect in kind, on both sides of the scale.
</li></ul></li><li> Taken in an interesting direction with the Duchess in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IShallWearMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IShallWearMidnight">I Shall Wear Midnight</a></em>. She may be rude or even contemptuous to her servants, but she takes care of them. She considers it a matter of pride that no one who works for her will ever have to beg for food, and in fact, the reason she has so many servants is because a fair number of them are needed to take care of the servants too old to work.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em>. The villain of the story is Reacher Gilt, and our hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Moist</a> notes that impersonating him in a letter to a maître d' is a surefire way to get himself a table; Reacher's entire public image is an act, and part of the persona he presents involves tipping like a drunken sailor, even though he's a murderous bastard underneath. Moist on the other hand is a good guy (or at least a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">less evil guy</a>) who cannot afford the expensive meal, and implicitly intends to scam his way out of paying (before Reacher offers to buy it for him).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff">Snuff</a></em>, Vimes learns that the previous Lady Ramkin had a policy that the housemaids may not even <em>look</em> at a man while on the job, and must turn to face the wall when one comes by (or flee if addressed). He considers this to be classist bullshit until his wife explains the reasoning; it's to protect the maids. They aren't especially worldly or well educated, and young aristocratic males have a tendency to take advantage of them, so preventing any contact while they are on the job is wise. The maids are otherwise well treated, well paid, and thanks to this policy "have no shame about wearing white on their wedding days".
<ul><li> Snuff also reveals that the late Lord Ramkin was this; he was a drunken old sot, but also a very <em>jolly</em> one who had no qualms about throwing money around and drinking with the servants as equals. Another holder of the title <em>tried</em> to avert this by tossing red hot pennies to the gate guards for a laugh, but was usually so drunk that he'd do it with dollars instead, so the servants actually miss the practice.
</li></ul></li><li> Young Vetinari is nice to the Assassins' Guild porter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em>, although apparently mostly for cynical reasons: being friendly with the porter gives him opportunities to snoop. It seems to be a bit of a strategy of his to get on good terms with the sort of people others don't respect, as when most of the guilds decide they've got an ax to grind with him the Beggars, Seamstresses, and so on are still on his side.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, the hero Ward is nice to everyone. Including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">immortal slave he inherited and cannot set free</a>.
</li><li> The protagonist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a>, Harry Dresden, can be counted on to be as nice to the waiter as he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu">snarky</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Queens of Fairy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyEmbracedFiend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyEmbracedFiend">vampires</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">fallen angels</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Duumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Duumvirate">Duumvirate</a></em> uses this trope constantly. Being on good terms with your servants is a mark of competence as a master. The titular characters even use it to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> decide who to let live</span> at the end of the book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles">Enchanted Forest Chronicles</a></em>: In <em>Dealing With Dragons</em>, Cimorene is technically hired help for Kazul, but the relationship between the two is very much that of close friends. This is notable considering that pretty much all the other dragons ignore their princesses and don't expect much out of them (Kazul even says that princesses are generally only kept as a "minor" mark of social status) while the princesses don't actually do any work and run off with whatever prince comes to rescue them.
<ul><li> While King Mendabar isn't very fond of his elven servant, Willin, he is still shown to be a sympathetic character. This is because while Willin means well, he tends to bother Mendabar about stuff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance">the king doesn't need him fussing with</a>. Mendabar does treat his subjects as kindly as he can, which is impressive considering that his kingdom is full of magical creatures who constantly are bickering and enchanting each other and getting into trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> An inversion occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersShadow">Ender's Shadow</a></em> novels, where John Paul warns his son Peter that Achilles is undermining Peter's leadership because Achilles is always kind and friendly with the staff, while Peter tends to ignore them. In this case, though, Peter is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> and Achilles is a murderous psychopath (albeit one who is very good at lying when he needs to).
</li><li> A subversion of sorts from Thomas Dixon's <em>Fall of a Nation</em>: The heroine's family servant thinks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is a swell fellow because he tips generously. As it turns out, this is all part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a>'s plan to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>.

Chesterton</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FatherBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FatherBrown">Father Brown</a></em> stories, Father Brown explains why he didn't trust the villainess:
<div class="indent"><em>If you want to know what a lady is really like, don't look at her; for she may be too clever for you. Don't look at the men round her, for they may be too silly about her. But look at some other woman who is always near to her, and especially one who is under her. You will see in that mirror her real face, and the face mirrored in Mrs. Sands was very ugly.</em>
</div><ul><li> In another one, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Denouement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Denouement">Dénouement</a> hinges on the fact that Father Brown talks to the secretary, whereas the employer knows nothing about him besides his name.
</li><li> In yet another one, the villain's deception only works because his victims don't pay any attention to the waiters serving them. Chesterton was slightly fond of this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> In Sara Paretsky's <em>Fire Sale</em>, readers are clued in fairly early that Billy, the youngest of the family that turns out to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> (they own a Walmart-like corporation), is different from the rest of his family by how he treats the workers kindly and they all are happy to see him.

Fran's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> is foreshadowed by her telling Amber not to bother thanking Hannah, a mere Level 57 Law Enforcement Office Cleaner.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em>, the good officers/aristocrats are always very polite to subordinates and make sure they get lots of credit for their work, whereas evil ones belittle and tyrannize their underlings and treat servants as air that brings them things.

<ul><li> This is what makes Bertie worthy of having Jeeves as a valet: although he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a> who's always carrying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroBall">Hero Ball</a>, Bertie's a really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> and an ideal employer.
</li><li> Bertie realizes that Florence Craye truly is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> when he learns how mean she is to servants. According to a comment from Jeeves in the TV version, her downstairs nickname is "Lady <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Caligula</a>". Both she and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">Honoriah Glossop</a> have stated their dislike of Jeeves, and Bertie's Aunt Agatha (probably the most class-conscious character around) routinely criticizes Bertie for consulting Jeeves on personal matters.
</li><li> All of Bertie's friends respect Jeeves' competence and intelligence: Bingo Little regularly relies on Jeeves for help with his romantic problems (often involving women of a lower social class as an added bonus), and Bertie's Aunt Dahlia invites Bertie to stay just to have access to Jeeves for her schemes. Bertie is (usually) the first to recommend Jeeves' advice and opinion, openly admitting that Jeeves is the brains of the pair - "the man practically lives on fish!"

</li><li> In <em>The Kadin</em>, Lady Janet not only treats her own people well, but when she hires crafters to build her new hall, she makes sure the craftmasters pay their workers as soon as she pays them, something a few of them aren't happy about. Janet also gets regularly called out for being nice to her serfs and servants, not that she cares. Their love for her encourages them to do their best, and her demesne is very prosperous.

<ul><li> In <em>Have His Carcase</em>, Harriet Vane is cleared of suspicion because the police asked her charwoman about her associates; they have found this a reliable way of finding them out.
</li><li> Also, part of the signal that the murder victim in <em>Whose Body?</em> is a good guy is that he was well-liked by his servants, not just because of this, but also in a more classist way, because he was a "natural gentleman" despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a>- one point in solving the mystery was that he would always neatly fold his clothing before going to bed.

Percy noticed a little girl stoking the hearth on his first day at Camp Half-Blood, but gave it no other thought. She later reveals herself to be the goddess Hestia, saying that very few people ever stop to speak with her  but Nico did. Later, when they fight the Titan Iapetus and erase his memory (renaming him Bob), Percy never gives him a second thought after Persephone says he'll be taken care of. But Nico visited him periodically and talked to him, and it's Nico putting in a good word for him that causes Bob to save Percy and Annabeth's lives later. Percy is by no means unkind, but he also doesn't go out of his way to help people beyond monster slaying and demigod heroics. When he tells Nico this, Nico tells him it's dangerous not to give people a second thought.
</li><li> Subverted in an anecdote from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan">Perry Rhodan</a></em>, which has a noble Arkonide acting conspicuously polite towards a mere gardener (of an "inferior" species, at that) who has greeted him in the same way <em>not</em> out of any particular respect or appreciation, but simply to demonstrate that just like everything else his grasp of <em>manners</em> is naturally also superior to that of "such a creature".
</li><li> This trope is ubiquitous in all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a>'s novels. Heroes and their allies are good nobles, who are kind to peasants and servants and care for their needs, while villains are frequently cruel to commoners as well as to animals, abusing their authority over both.
<ul><li> Subverted by the Rogue of Port Caynn, Pearl, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Bloodhound</a></em>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">likes dogs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">threatens people who hurt them</a>. Bekka knows she has no other redeeming characteristics, but this still makes it harder than it was before.
</li><li> Inversion: The Emperor of Carthak had Daine, the most famous wildmage in Tortall, travel to his palace <em>just to heal his pet birds</em>  yet he can "send armies to their deaths without batting an eye." This is the first clue as to how messed-up he is.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Potterverse</a>, the Wizarding World's treatment of sentient non-humans (especially house-elves, who are by nature vulnerable to exploitation) is both an overtly political issue and a sign of personal values, though we only ever get to see Wizarding Britain's stances on it:
<ul><li> Hermione and Harry play this trope straight from the beginning, both being raised in the Muggle world (though Harry was a bit slow to catch on regarding the elves, only realizing the consequences in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Half-Blood Prince</a></em>, and Hermione may have played it too straight due to naivete in the beginning). Ron is a bit more difficult to categorize. He is a good person like his friends, but he hasn't gotten as much chance to interact. The only hesitance he has shown is a wariness toward giants (which, to be frank, is understandable given their size and history of violence, to which Hagrid can attest). He also acts as a bit of a foil toward Hermione about house-elves, but has nothing against them. However, he seems to be even more unaware than Harry of the potential consequences of the isolating behavior. He does earn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss">something special</a> from Hermione when he advises that they order the House-Elves to retreat, finding the idea of ordering the elves to die for them abhorrent.
</li><li> Hogwarts has the largest population of house-elves in the world, but they all wear clean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">pillowcases</a> with the Hogwarts seal stamped on them, as opposed to the filthy rags other house elves are shown wearing, and Dumbledore allows Dobby to work as hired help rather than an indentured servant and encourages Dobby to insult him in private. His starting offer of wages and vacation days is actually <em>too generous</em> for Dobby, who demands a lower one. Helga Hufflepuff, one of the founders of Hogwarts, gathered house-elves to the school so that they would have steady work (which elves thrive on) and not run the risk of being abused by harsh masters out in the wizarding world.
</li><li> Sirius Black, source of the page quote, was (according to Dumbledore) kind to house-elves in general but couldn't stand his own house elf Kreacher when stuck trapped in the same house for a year while hiding in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, while his evil-aligned family were kind to Kreacher. Sirius is the second type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHeroToHisValet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHeroToHisValet">No Hero to His Valet</a>: he <em>is</em> good, but he views Kreacher as an embodiment of everything he loathed about his childhood and family traditions, resulting in a very negative relationship (not to mention the implications he and Kreacher never got along even back when Sirius was a child). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This proves to be Sirius' undoing.</span>
</li><li> As Hermione points out, house-elves tend to absorb and reflect the beliefs of those who are kind to them, so for most of the story Kreacher is racist, classist, and nasty... until Harry and Hermione are kind to him and he begins taking on the beliefs of his new master, albeit quite late in the series.
</li><li> Ironically, the quote comes from Sirius commenting on Barty Crouch's bad treatment of his house-elf Winky, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is arguably just Crouch desperate to stop the investigation and protect his son.</span>
</li><li> Dumbledore warns Harry at one point that, at a national level, wizards and witches are being too arrogant and patronizing in dealing with "inferior species" (goblins, house-elves, centaurs, etc), and if they don't start treating them fairly, they are going to make unnecessary enemies at a time when they can ill-afford to do so. There are repeated instances of non-humans being genuinely surprised that Harry and his friends treat them with respect, or becoming increasingly alienated by the Ministry's insensitive behavior.
<ul><li> Umbridge refers to the centaurs of the Forbidden Forest as "filthy half-breeds" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">to their faces.</a> Their reaction leaves her with a permanent fear of clopping hooves.
</li><li> Dumbledore's prediction comes fully true in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Voldemort grants special treatment to a few particularly violent non-human species that he finds useful as weapons, but the rest suffer even more abuse at the hands of the Death Eaters than they did under the Ministry, and rise against him in outright revolt after Harry's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span>.
</li><li> Beautifully shown in <em>The Deathly Hallows</em>. After the house-elf <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dobby's</span> death, Harry, Ron and Dean dig his grave by hand to show the depths of their gratitude and grief. The goblin Griphook notices this and remarks to Harry that goblins and house-elves are not used to being given this sort of respect from wizards, and it helps him decide to aid Harry in his quest. Without him, it would have failed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>, one of the signs that Mr. Darcy isn't as bad as Elizabeth had initially believed is that his servants speak glowingly of him to strangers.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma">Emma</a></em>, this trope is abundant with Emma and her father, who have earned the devotion of their servants - it's particularly true of Serle, the cook, who patiently puts up with Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and contributes to the security of the household as well as cooking things <em>exactly</em> the way he wants them made. Mr. Knightley is also highly regarded by those who work for him. Conversely, the stuck-up Eltons are shown in one scene to actually be quite rude to Mr. Knightley's maid.
</li></ul></li><li> In L. Jagi Lamplighter's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProsperosDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProsperosDaughter">Prospero Lost</a></em>, Miranda does, in the opening scenes, sacrifice valuable artifacts to save a servant, though she is conflicted over it. Later, after she learns that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a> may be magically induced, and is told that her aerial servants love her, she consciously decides to use persuasion rather than force to get Boreaus to not harm humans, and then instead of flatly refusing to free them, tells the air spirits that she would need them to swear to keep the air spirits from causing harm. They concede that this would be difficult but start thinking about how they could pull it off, grateful for even the chance. Also, when her brother complains of one of her employees speaking his mind, she backs up the employee.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretGarden">The Secret Garden</a></em>, Mary's mother wanted her out of the way, and the servants would just try to keep Mary quiet. As a consequence, she quickly learned that tantrums and hitting would get her what she wanted. Her uncle's servants do not treat her with deference, which helps in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a>.
<ul><li> Mary also quickly takes a liking to Martha, Dickon, and their family, along with the gardener. Mostly this is because those are the people who are consistently around, while her uncle is never there. Even when she befriends Colin, she chooses to spend the day with Dickon instead of him at one point.
</li><li> Conversely Sara Crewe, heroine of the same author's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess">A Little Princess</a></em>, treats the servants at Miss Minchin's with courtesy. When she's the school's "show pupil", she is kind to scullery maid Becky, realizing out loud, "We are just the same — I am only a little girl like you. It's just an accident that I am not you, and you are not me." And later when she's relegated to the status of servant herself, even when the other servants verbally abuse her she responds with "a quaint civility":
<div class="indent">"She's got more airs and graces than if she come from Buckingham Palace, that young one," said the cook, chuckling a little sometimes. "I lose my temper with her often enough, but I will say she never forgets her manners. 'If you please, cook'; 'Will you be so kind, cook?' 'I beg your pardon, cook'; 'May I trouble you, cook?' She drops 'em about the kitchen as if they was nothing."
</div></li><li> In one of the adaptations, even when she's a servant and starving, Sara gives her last bit of food to a starving family.
<ul><li> She also, in the book, buys herself a dozen sweet rolls with some money she finds in the street  but gives all but one of them to a homeless waif who's even hungrier than she is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end she learns that this act inspires the baker, who witnesses it, to adopt the waif in question, giving her both a home and a job.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the Cuaron adaptation, Sara also promises to return and rescue Becky when she escapes from the boarding house. And she does.
</li></ul></li><li> In "The Secret Sin of Septimus Brope", by Saki, there is the following exchange:
<div class="indent">"Is your maid called Florence?" <br/>"Her name is Florinda." <br/>"What an extraordinary name to give a maid!" <br/>"I did not give it to her; she arrived in my service already christened." <br/>"What I mean is," said Mrs. Riversedge, "that when I get maids with unsuitable names <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMisnaming">I call them Jane</a>; they soon get used to it." <br/>"An excellent plan," said the aunt of Clovis coldly; "unfortunately I have got used to being called Jane myself. It happens to be my name."
</div></li><li> In <em>The Problem of Thor Bridge</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> benefits from this trope when one of his wealthy client's employees comes at the outset to warn him about the client's vindictive nature. Holmes even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> it when he points out the insights one can get into a man's character when you see what his employees think of him.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephaSherman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephaSherman">Josepha Sherman</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShiningFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShiningFalcon">The Shining Falcon</a></em>, Ljuba is quite frustrated at how Finist is so concerned with the welfare of the peasants and other commoners.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>:
<ul><li> Eddard Stark is always polite and respectful with his servants. He regularly invites one of his household members to dine with him for a night  ranging from the steward to the blacksmith to the old servant woman  to better understand the needs of his smallfolk.
</li><li> Arya Stark, Eddard's younger daughter has inherited this from him, as she was very close to the household servants growing up  to the point they called her "Arya Underfoot"  and befriends and regards the smallfolk as equals. She also becomes fiercely protective of the downtrodden after witnessing the abuse of commoners during the war.
</li><li> Catelyn Stark also treats the commoners well. After promising a ship's crew a bonus if they made good time, she paid each oarsman personally rather than give the money to their captain, who would have kept it all for himself.
</li><li> Edmure Tully was the only noble to allow his peasants to take refuge in his castle during the war, a move which the others saw as foolish and soft-hearted. This is a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License  History</a> combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a>; the whole point of having a castle with a large courtyard and big sturdy walls is to protect the commoners during a siege. After all, if they all get killed by the enemy, who's going to take care of your land afterwards?
</li><li> Daenerys Targaryen frees slaves, treats her servants with respect, and thinks of all of her followers as her children. Harming them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">a surefire way</a> to make her very, <em>very</em> angry.

This is likely an extension of his being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a>. He even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">ships them</a>, and invites a poor raped girl into his household because he can.
</li><li> Tyrion Lannister starts off this way, treating the prostitutes he sleeps with respectfully and even teaching one how to read; but as the books go forward he becomes more callous, and by the fifth book he treats them like garbage.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce">Spaceforce</a></em> novels, society in the Taysan Empire is strictly stratified along caste and class lines. In the first book Jay is, at considerable personal risk, masquerading as swordbearer caste when he is in fact of lowly origins. When he treats a servant with unnecessary politeness and consideration, it's enough to draw attention to himself.

The mechanic is a Verpine, and there are stories about Verpine mechanics tinkering with craft and forgetting that most pilots don't count in base six or have vision that lets them see microscopic detail. But none of the stories are substantiated.

Wedge blinks and gives him those days, apparently completely ignorant of the fact that X-Wings have no extruder valve. He wanders around for a bit, making the mechanics uneasy and meaning that they can't go on break for fear of being written up; they retaliate by loudly telling each other about catastrophic mechanical failures in X-Wings and the resultant loss of life. After he finally leaves, they fix the minor problems and play sabacc. Overestimating the time makes them look good.

</li><li> <em>Boiling Point</em> (the 2005 MTV show): They secretly set up people to see how long they could remain civil to people who were being unreasonable with them. An episode tested which of three college-age customers could remain at least civil with the waiter for fourteen minutes during which MTV would call the customer before he or she had started eating, have the server clear the table in his or her absence, have the plate brought back with bits of garbage stuck to it, and insist the customer pay full price anyway. This particular bit was notorious because the only one of the three who <em>failed</em> was a certain (then-unknown) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Stefani Germanotta</a>.

Keep in mind that it was a free meal to begin with, and he didn't even eat it because he was only there for a deal. This is meant to imply the radical changes Walt goes through over the course of the time difference... as well as the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he knows he doesn't have long to live.</span>

</li><li> And when it <em>doesn't</em> happen, it's noteworthy enough to be called out: see the late 10th Doctor episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight">"Midnight"</a> and the stewardess of the tour shuttle he and several strangers are on.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em>. Every person of nobility is considered decent if they treat their servants well. The Granthams tend to go above and beyond what many employers of the time would have done: paying for their cook to get eye surgery, as opposed to firing and replacing her as many would have, and Lady Mary rushing her maid Anna to a London doctor in the middle of the night to keep her from miscarrying, among other things. Mary can be quite nasty, especially to her sister Edith, but she's always polite to Anna and takes very good care of her; Anna is one of a very few people whose opinion Mary actually values, and whose advice she will seek when she's uncertain. In the movie, she explicitly calls Anna a good friend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Endgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Endgame">Endgame</a></em>: Arkady Balagan despises the upper management of the Huxley Hotel, and they would really like to shift him out of the penthouse suite he's occupying, but he is generally nice to the staff.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EnemyAtTheDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EnemyAtTheDoor">Enemy at the Door</a></em>: Von Bulow, the title character of "The Prussian Officer", appears at first to be a gentleman, but is rude to the waiter, treats his valet terribly, and is basically a dick to anyone he considers a social inferior. He's such an awful person he makes the SS officer look like a human being.
</li><li> Subverted in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>. Niles praises Daphne for <em>not</em> being nice to the waiter (or the electrician, in this case).
<ul><li> Frasier himself zig-zags on this. While he will <em>initially</em> make every effort to be polite and genial, if the slightest thing throws him off, he often goes straight to totally insufferable. The problem is exacerbated when you realize that much of what does throw him off is stuff that most working class people wouldn't know. For example, he once insulted a waitress when she didn't know the difference between two vintages of the same wine. That said, once his boorishness is pointed out to him, he does usually apologize and try to make up for his behavior.
</li></ul></li><li> The Banks family (and Will) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a></em> treat Geoffrey, the butler, with varying degrees of niceness versus taking him for granted.
<ul><li> Philip generally tries to keep his relationship with Geoffrey professional, but sometimes takes him for granted or talks over him, and pays him less than he'd like. On the other hand, he's been very generous to him on occasion; he paid his mother's medical bills, and in the final episode, upgraded his airline ticket to first-class <em>and</em> gave him his spring bonus.
</li><li> Vivian and Ashley are undoubtedly the nicest. In fact, any time Geoffrey has extra time off, it's usually thanks to Vivian.
</li><li> Carlton and Hilary take Geoffrey completely for granted, <em>especially</em> Hilary, who makes demands of him nonstop. Nicky can be a bit of this, too, but he's also only five.
</li><li> Will often takes Geoffrey for granted. However, when Geoffrey has personal problems, Will is the first person to have his back. It reflects in how Geoffrey treats them as well: he is insulting towards Phil, kind towards Ashley and Vivian, is dismissive of Carlton and Hilary, and generally tries to take Will under his wing and treats him almost as a wayward son.
</li></ul></li><li> During a stint in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> where Joey worked at the coffee shop as a waiter, one of the tips he gets from Rachel was that if a customer's ever rude to you, you spit in his muffin. When Ross (who during all this has been repeatedly asking Joey to take his order) loses his patience, Joey tells him that he'll throw in a free muffin along with his coffee.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tywin Lannister has a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments with Arya Stark and treats her with a surprising amount of respect, largely because he is amused by her and obviously enjoys the company of a bright youngster more than that of his rather pedestrian retainers and warlords, though he does warn her to "be careful" when she steps over the line. Of course, this doesn't stop him casually giving her over to the monstrous Gregor Clegane once he has to leave.
</li><li> Daenerys Targaryen treats her servants with a great deal of respect.
</li><li> King Renly Baratheon shows concern for the lowborn soldiers in his army, making the effort to remember their names (Gerald in the episode) and the nature of their injury if they have one.
</li><li> In a flashback, Lyanna is shown to be kinder to Hodor (then Wyllis) than Ned was at the time, giving the boy some tips on how to spar with Benjen.
</li><li> Robb is even nice to enemy soldiers outside of combat. As far as Robb's concerned, being King is no excuse for being a dick.
</li><li> What separates Arya from Sansa is her visible lack of snobbery and kindness to everyone regardless of their class. She remembers the violence committed on the poor like Mycah and Lommy Greenhands long after most people have forgotten them. It also hurts her when Gendry gives her a reality check that if they were to return to safety, Arya would go back to being a highborn daughter while Gendry will be a mere commoner again and they would not enjoy the close friendship they had known until then.
</li><li> Tytos Lannister had his kennelmaster (the grandfather of Gregor and Sandor), knighted for saving his life from a lioness  thus making the latter the forebear of House Clegane. Though typical for the series, this one act of kindness led to killing machines Ser Gregor Clegane and Sandor Clegane when they enter the Lannister service as loyal hitmen.
</li><li> Even though her mother despises Ser Davos, Shireen considers him her friend, and resolves to teach him to read.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostWhisperer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostWhisperer">Ghost Whisperer</a></em>, Delia declines a second date with a guy who completely freaks out and berates a waiter for spilling something on Delia (far more than the poor guy deserves). The date was otherwise perfect, but she explains that her mother always told her never to date a man who was rude to waiters.
</li><li> Played with on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em>  Emily is never outright rude to her servants, but has ridiculously high standards and changes maids every couple of weeks for reasons that Lorelai finds absurd.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeatOfTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeatOfTheSun">Heat Of The Sun</a></em>, set in colonial Kenya, the hero (played by Trevor Eve), a detective, stands up for the indigenous Africans, shakes hands with black servants, etc., while his boss, a colonialist jerk, looks down on them.
</li><li> Gregory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a>, while <em>giving a eulogy at his father's funeral,</em> professes his belief that the test of a man's character is how he treats those over whom he has total power. He notes his complete lack of surprise that all the military officers present are his father's rank or higher, and tells the audience that his father failed the test, and that maybe if he had been a better father, House would have been a better son.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first sign that a woman Ted briefly dates is awful is her yelling at a waiter and demanding a free appetizer.
</li><li> The gang is always nice to Wendy the waitress, who works in their favourite pub.
</li><li> Barney is shown to usually be nice to his servers (he inevitably learns the names of his cabbies and converses with them like friends). He does a variety of less-nice things like yelling at a receptionist until she cries, however. Basically, whether anyone in the gang is nice to the waiter depends on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>.
</li><li> Lily is referring to a server by the wrong name after he told her his correct name. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> in that episode.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle">Hustle</a></em>, the marks are invariably rude to waiters, the hired help, their own employees and anyone else lower than them on the social pecking order. In one episode, Albert is watching a potential mark at a restaurant. One of the other people at the table leaves a generous tip for the waiter which the mark then pockets for himself when the others leave. At this point, Albert decides that he is definitely their next target.
<ul><li> In "Big Daddy", a pit boss gets fired as a result of failing to stop the crew ripping off the casino. When he opens his locker to clean it out, he discovers the crew have left a huge pile of cash for him as compensation.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares">Kitchen Nightmares</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay">Gordon Ramsay</a> is always nice to the staff that doesn't deserve to be yelled at, who in turn are typically the most honest in regards to the restaurant's problems. A good example is the "Oceania" episode, where he's almost apologetic to have to send the waitress back with the food. In "Amy's Baking Company", he is duly appalled when he learns that one of the owners takes all of the tips given to the waiters/waitresses and when a waitress is summarily fired for asking a simple question. He makes sure to tip the waitress directly and tries to stand up for them by telling the customers about their tips being stolen and how they deserve those tips.

<ul><li> Played with when Joan makes it a point to be exceptionally nice to the phone line operators, to the point of bringing them flowers and presents. It's made clear that this is not out of kindness, but because being on an operator's bad side will make it impossible for you to do your job.
</li><li> Roger needs to have his shoes shined but the man who shines shoes in their office building is absent so he offhandedly asks his secretary to inquire what happened to the man. His dutiful secretary calls up the man's home and finds out that he died. The man's family is extremely touched that Roger seemed to care so much about the well being of the man who shined his shoes that they send him the dead man's shoe shining kit as a keepsake. Roger is amused by the misunderstanding but it gives him an epiphany and it helps him deal with his mother's recent death.

While he clearly assumes he's the superior and constantly insults and berates Merlin while Merlin's trying to do his job, he has shown that he cares about the common people and occasionally shows Merlin some measure of affection and respect. He's also willing to risk his life to protect or save Merlin without a second's thought.

<ul><li> Fran Fine grew up in a working-class family, so it's expected, but it deserves special mention since it's frequently contrasted with the snooty blue-bloods she usually deals with. In fact, the first person from the Sheffield household to truly accept her was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJeeves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJeeves">the butler Niles</a>, with whom she becomes close friends throughout the series. During "The Strike", she explicitly refuses to cross a picket line of striking busboys and had to be forcibly dragged by Maxwell, spinning into a scandal by the paparazzi. In another episode, "Personal Business", when she dates an obnoxious soap star, she addressed the driver by name whereas her date only called him "Driver."
</li><li> In "The Butler, the Husband, the Wife and Her Mother", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FawltyTowersPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FawltyTowersPlot">Niles has to pretend he's Maxwell Sheffield and married to Fran as an attempt for Fran's mother Sylvia to one-up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche">her brother-in-law Jack and his daughter Marsha</a>, which goes well until Maxwell and the Sheffield children comes back... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">and then the Butler's Association arrives to judge Niles's performance</a>. Once the scheme backfires and the representatives are ready to give Niles a horrible appraisal, Maxwell points out that if a family is willing put on that kind of performance for their butler, he must be a truly spectacular butler indeed and that Niles is, basically, family. Also, after learning that Fran's the nanny for the Sheffields, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Marsha</a> starts gloating about Fran "only" being the nanny, till <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">the usually timid Maggie</a> says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/TheNanny">Who asked you anyway, you big green cow!?</a>", and Sylvia, whose ego started this mess, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumblePie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumblePie">finally says</a> "At least she's got a job. I wouldn't trade my Fran for all the Marshas in Miami.".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">C.C. Babcock</a> is in no way nice to Niles, and she pays dearly for it. Some of the things that are seen or mentioned during the show: swapping out her lip balm for glue stick, putting dishwater in her coffee, switching some labels on breath spray and pepper spray, leaving her trapped in a malfunctioning wheelchair spinning out of control, squirting lemon juice into her eye, handing her a scalding hot teapot, and in general, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrankster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrankster">Niles plays hacky-sack with her mental and physical health the entire series</a>. And she is especially ill-mannered towards Fran, who she sees as a rival for Maxwell's affections. C.C. is very condescending to Fran, undermines her and tries to manipulate her in one way or another, but Fran usually has the last laugh.

This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">serves him well</a>, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">those people usually end up being the most helpful</a>.

</li><li> Like Sara in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALittlePrincess">A Little Princess</a></em>, the Japanese drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShokojoSeira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShokojoSeira">Shōkōjo Seira</a></em> has the main character Seira being very kind and friendly with everyone around her, whether they are the same rank as her or not. Back in India, she treats all her servants amiably and they in return love her very much. She approaches Kaito (Becky's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Spear Counterpart</a>) when no one else does and drops off books for him to read. Even when she loses her fortune and everyone is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">out to make her life miserable</a>, Seira still smiles and bows politely to them.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, the team finds a village where they use creatures called Unas as slave labour. While attempting to barter for one Unas in particular, resident nice guy Daniel thanks an Unas who serves them drinks. The trader they're bartering with expresses surprise at this and Daniel, in an attempt to keep up appearances as a slave trader, claims that he's merely using positive reinforcement to better train the Unas.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Suits">Suits</a></em>, Daniel Hardman made the mistake of badly tipping the staff at a hotel where he was having clandestine rendezvous with his mistress. More than five years later, they still remember him and are willing to testify about the affair. Within the law firm of Pearson-Hardman being rude to the secretaries and paralegals is pretty much career suicide to anyone who is not already a senior partner. And even <em>they</em> respect Donna.
</li><li> Played both ways in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt">The Thick of It</a></em>. The ministers in charge treat their subordinates horribly, and PR enforcers Malcolm and Jamie have no problem hurling truckloads of abuse at politicians and civil servants, but the Caledonian Mafiosos are both markedly more patient with- as well as friendly and polite to- "normal people" like cleaners and drivers. They seem to reserve their ire for those who make it clear they're only in it for themselves and arguably deserve it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Trust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Trust">Trust</a></em>, Little Paul is the only member of the Getty family who treats the elder Getty's butler Jahangir like a human being. The others can't even be bothered to learn his name; they all call him Bullimore, which was the name of Paul Getty's first butler God knows how many years earlier.
</li><li> One of the reasons for President Jed Bartlet's popularity with viewers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> was most likely this trope, as Bartlet was consistently shown to be a kindly, supportive and genuinely caring person with those who worked for him. It was particularly apparent in his fatherly relationship with his personal aide Charlie. He didn't always remember their names, but he never failed to treat them well. This is also true of all of his senior staff with the notable exception of Toby, who hates working with anybody who can't write up to his standards or annoys him in the slightest, and wants everyone to know it. He is, however, very protective of the ones who manage to stick it out. And interestingly, most of the baddies on the show seem to have very loyal staffs of their own.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em> had Will on a date with an arrogant man. At the end of the date, they began to argue over which of them should pay the bill. Will gets the waiter to give <em>him</em> the bill with the promise that "I'll tip you."
<ul><li> Previously, Will mentions playing the "Be Nice To Waiters" game. He says, "If you win, you get to not go to hell."

<ul><li> Thomas Cromwell treats most people with decency and respect until they give him reason not to; he pulls up a chair for the near-fainting Princess Mary when her mother tells her to stand out of courtesy and is kind to his subordinates. He is still, however, the man who orchestrated the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> and execution of Anne Boleyn and her purported lovers.
</li><li> Anne Boleyn's habit of <em>not</em> doing this plays a major role in her downfall. She's irritable and insulting to her ladies-in-waiting and goes so far as to strike Lady Rochford in the face. Rochford exacts revenge by telling Cromwell that Anne and her brother George Boleyn are sleeping together.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> uses this trope a lot:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, it's shown that the dwarves have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Fantastic Caste System</a>, and two opponents fight to become the next king. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince">The Evil Prince</a> Bhelen, who poisoned his father (the last king), killed his eldest brother, made the middle sibling into the fall guy, and wants to be king simply because he wants to rule, is for expanding rights for the lower castes and casteless and supports economic reforms for expanding surface trade rights for the merchants. He even marries a casteless woman for love. His opponent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> Harrowmont, was the former king's best friend who is running to honour his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastRequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastRequest">Last Request</a>, and fought to maintain the innocence of the Dwarf Noble if you picked that origin. He is also a traditionalist who supports the current caste system, favours the nobles and soldier castes, and dislikes caste-less.
<ul><li> The Dwarf Noble can have this relationship with Gorim, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">second</a>, even demanding that their elder brother Trian apologise after he insulted Gorim for being from an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">inferior caste</a>". The Female Dwarf Noble and Gorim can even have a secret relationship on the side, though it can't be made official as the other nobles would skin Gorim alive for dallying above his station.
</li><li> During the Dwarf Noble origin, they can also invoke this by choosing dialogue options that make them come across as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWisePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWisePrince">Wise Prince/Princess</a> (and avoiding those which act like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a>). This includes defending a scribe who has earned the ire of a fellow noble by writing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartsAndAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartsAndAll">unflattering (but true)</a> book about his Paragon ancestor, showing kindness towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl">Rica</a> when she assumed they were Bhelen coming to meet her in his bedchamber, and rebuking Gorim several times for being rude towards the various merchants in the Diamond Quarter.
</li><li> The Human Noble has a chance to do this during his/her origin as well, when interacting with Nan, the head of the kitchen in Castle Cousland, and also with some soldiers who are playing cards while guarding the treasury. It's also implied that the characters' parents are this way toward servants, soldiers, and commoners, which is a big part of why the people of Highever are so loyal to the Cousland family.
</li></ul></li><li> In a similar vein, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> Hawke has several opportunities when dealing with various people, including bartenders, quarrymen, prostitutes, and the servants in his/her own noble household.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, it's revealed that there's an entire spy network built on this principle. Servants in noble households who are treated badly by their employers will frequently tip off the Friends of Red Jenny about those same employers' less-than-savory behavior, and the Jennies use this information to make life more difficult for those nobles. The nobles who treat their employees well are generally not subjected to retaliation by the Jennies, since their servants have fewer complaints. Sera, a companion of the Inquisitor who belongs to this group, often reminds the player character not to "punch down" on the people supporting them from underneath.

<ul><li> Both Mallory and Sterling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a> treat their hired help at ISIS like crap, though Mallory treats Sterling just as bad (if not worse) as the rest of her ISIS employees, not to mention is far more sympathetic towards Woodhouse (Sterling's manservant and male nanny) than her son is. Mallory summed it up quite well when she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist">Mistaken for Racist</a>.

</div><ul><li> Sterling, meanwhile, is marginally nicer to the staff, though he tends to behave like a bullying jock toward most of them. But his behavior toward Woodhouse blows right past bullying and into outright torture, including forcing Woodhouse to do odd things like eat bowls of spider-webs and have his brother sent to prison. On the other hand, flashbacks have shown that while Woodhouse was Sterling's nanny, he often left the kid alone in a run-down apartment while he locked himself in the bathroom and got high (even on Sterling's birthday), so perhaps this is Sterling's idea of payback.

Sure, Zuko comes off as a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> at first, but he does save the life of one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirts</a> in "The Storm." Azula's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>, meanwhile, includes threatening to throw her ship's captain overboard and let him drown because he's reluctant to bring the ship in to shore during a period of dangerous tides. (To be fair he later proved himself an idiot, so maybe she had some reason to treat him that way. At least that time.)
<ul><li> Further driven home in the third season, where we see Zuko and Azula interacting with their respective servants. Zuko is unfailingly polite to his servants and they seem happy to work for him. In contrast, Azula's servants are terrified of her (rightfully so) and the first sign of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> is when she <em>banishes one of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">for leaving a pit in her cherries</a>.</em> This is also implied to be an act of mercy by Azula, so no telling what she has done to servants who have screwed up in the past.
</li><li> The events surrounding the Agni Kai that left Zuko scarred and banished worked as both a straight use and a inversion of this trope. Zuko protested a plan that would have led to the pointless deaths of many loyal soldiers, but by doing so, he ticked off his father and was forced to duel. The inversion comes from the Fire Lord: if he was willing to brutally scar his own flesh and blood just to show everyone who's boss, he certainly wasn't going to be a good tipper. And considering Iroh's own habits <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (including befriending his own prison guard, and making sure she was not present during his escape)</span>, we know where Zuko learned a lot of it.

Capping that off, he's dismissive of his employees and doesn't care what they have to say. The only man under him he seems to care about his Hank (who's the only reason Strickland Propane isn't bankrupt), but even then he blows off many of his warnings and has him do his dirty work. In one episode, we see Buck's idea of tipping his pool boy is throwing large bills into the pool and laughing as he swims for them.

<ul><li> Twilight Sparkle, upon her arrival in Ponyville, <em>politely</em> and <em>sincerely</em> thanks the Royal Guardsponies that had been pulling her chariot, even calling them "sirs" (to which they react very positively). This is despite the fact that Twilight is currently in a <em>very</em> sour mood over being sent to Ponyville in the first place. Until this moment, viewers could be forgiven for assuming that Twilight is an asocial, self-centered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> (especially in light of her earlier treatment of Spike), but her being nice to ponies who are nothing more than temporarily-assigned servants proves that she is a good pony at heart - if a bit obsessive and thoughtless at times.
</li><li> Likewise with Twilight Sparkle's treatment of Spike, where she frequently does callous acts like slamming doors in his face, dropping heavy books on him, hurling him around via magic, or throwing things at him. It firmly establishes her as being <em>scatterbrained</em> rather than malicious, as she tends to not realize it's happening, and when she's not otherwise distracted she treats him very well.
</li><li> Princess Cadance is shown to be this as well, showing concern about her hairdresser calling in sick.
</li><li> In the season 4 episode "Rarity Takes Manehattan", Rarity establishes herself as this; she tips generously and helps strangers in need without a single thought to getting anything in return. Conversely, the antagonist of the day, Suri Polomare, routinely mistreats her assistant and takes advantage of others for her own gain. Needless to say, at the end both Rarity and Suri get what they deserve.

He's pretty cordial with his secretary Sheila, and regards his barber Alfonso as a confidant, even taking his advice to hire bounty hunters to find the <em>Millennium Falcon</em>.
</li><li> One of the ultimate examples of this trope is Mr. Burns on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. He frequently mistreats and abuses his employees to almost comical degrees, such as laughing maniacally when a window washer's platform collapses right outside his window. He abuses no one more than Smithers, who turns a blind eye to it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Smithers:</strong> Oh my God, Mr Burns is dead! Why must the good always die so young?

<ul><li> Greg Universe. As a humble musician who's lived in a literal van for the majority of his life, he's sympathetic to people who similarly don't have a lot of money. When he unexpectedly strikes it rich, and treats Steven and Pearl to an impromptu stay at an expensive hotel, he's very nice to all the staff and gives them handsome tips.
</li><li> Pink Diamond is likewise very kind to the Gems beneath her, treating her servants as close personal friends, wants to pal around with Amethysts, and even took the time to thank the Pebbles who tend to act in secret serving their masters. Recognizing this behavior is why the Pebbles conclude <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Steven is Pink Diamond</span>. However, we eventually see a darker side to this behavior, as Pink Diamond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">could act harmfully even toward the servants she considered friends</a>, usually because she didn't appreciate the (both physical and social) power she had over them.

Come Season 4, she's forcing her underlings to work three shifts back-to-back without a break, refusing to come rescue them when they're trapped in an acid storm, telling them to "figure it out" and get back to work, not telling them <em>anything</em> about what's going on or why she's having them do certain things, and lashing out at anyone who even attempts to question anything she does. She even berates and mistreats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEnamoredUnderling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEnamoredUnderling">Scorpia</a>, who has been nothing but kind and supportive since day one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This comes back to bite her, <em>hard</em>.

This is exactly the form that former Raytheon CEO Bill Swanson wrote in his booklet <em>Swanson's Unwritten Rules of Management</em>. Swanson says that the Waiter Rule is the only one that never fails. The way that someone treats service personnel is more often than not a very accurate look into how they will treat the people under them as a manager.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2dqpb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2dqpb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2dqpb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> "Such behavior is an accurate predictor of character because it isn't easily learned or unlearned but rather speaks to how people were raised, says Siki Giunta, CEO of U.S. technology company Managed Objects."</span>
<ul><li> A corollary to this is how people treat their helpers and compatriots, particularly teammates and group members. Watch for how often candidates discuss their teammates and watch the kind of language they use to describe them. If someone is trying to impress you and shows you nothing but reverence, but show minimal consideration to their cohorts, they aren't really a good person. Watch out for excessive talk about them, what they do, how great they are, how impressive are their accomplishments, and generally behave as if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">It's All About Me</a>. They are not good leaders, team members, representatives, or agents.

<ul><li> One thing it would seem to illustrate is G.K. Chesterton's contention that those who are most extreme in their opinions are commonly the most pleasant in personal relationships. During his tenure, Jesse Helms had an excellent reputation for treating his staff well. Ted Kennedy had one too.

</li><li> Likewise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> was a good boss to his personal servants and bodyguards - but kind of a colossal dick to pretty much everybody else. He took a certain joy out of bullying people such as forcing them to drink until they were sick/falling-over drunk, or calling them to watch movies with him at three in the morning. This was made possible by his ability to get whoever was head of the NKVD/NKGB at the time (he rotated people through the position at pretty regular intervals) to get pretty much anyone imprisoned, tortured, and even executed on trumped-up charges. Then he was idiot enough to fire a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Vlasik">bodyguard chief<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who faithfully served him for over twenty years, so no one dared to enter his room when he suffered a fatal stroke (the new bodyguard chief was in the hospital with appendicitis). Despite being a good boss to them, his personal servants would later admit that all of them hated him, and were glad he died in agony.
</li><li> Aversion: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a>. He had approval ratings of between 70 and 90 per cent throughout the war, had excellent political connections, was a masterful manipulator of public opinion, could sometimes be persuaded out of schemes that had a high risk of failing disastrously (e.g. invading Greece in 1943), and at least had a minimum acceptable level of competence among his lackeys and his subordinates even if he valued their loyalty and usefulness to him above all else - but he was simply <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">dreadful</a></em> to his secretarial staff, and not just because they were working-class. On the other hand, he was genuinely affectionate to his childhood nanny.
</li><li> Inversion: Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Nazi ambassador to England, and later Foreign Minister, liked to summon the most expensive tailors in London to the German embassy, making them wait all day, then sending them home without ever meeting with them. As the tailors counted among their clients people like cabinet ministers, industrialists and peers, news of what a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> Ribbentrop was quickly spread among London's elite and crippled his attempts to get an alliance between Britain and the Third Reich. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Well, that and the fact he was convinced true political power lay with the King and hereditary nobility rather than the Commons.</a>
</li><li> Prince Albert, husband of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a>, was gracious to everybody he met. There is one biography of the Queen which notes that the palace servants all loved Prince Albert; if he walked into a room where the maids were scrubbing the floor, he would take off his hat and smile and apologize for disturbing them.
</li><li> King George III, during his sane periods, was beloved by many commoners, especially compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">his son</a> (a total prick to waiters). He had a reputation of touring the villages on his estates and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>. Indeed, the popular American view of him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">dissolute tyrant</a> comes more from offloading hatred of various relatively obscure British ministers and MPs onto the more easily identifiable King.

It got so bad that her husband, who was actually the one getting ticketed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance">basically shouted at her to shut up</a>.

The idea is that when a person starts dating an abuser, said abuser will treat the waitress, store clerks, and other such people the way that they will treat the person in six months' time. Go on any website listing common dating dealbreakers, whether silly or serious in nature, and "was a dick to the waiter" will, without fail, be one of them.

The note with it read: "To the finest gentleman who ever walked through these halls. He made a porter feel like a king."
</li><li> "Queen of Mean" Leona Helmsley was well known for cruelty to her employees. She once refused to pay a $13,000 invoice from a contractor with six children, claiming that "If he kept his pants on, he wouldn't need the money" and made a waiter beg for his job after a drop of liquid fell from a saucer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumblePie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumblePie">A stint in prison and the loss of her hotel empire softened her up a little toward the end, though.</a>

</li></ul></li><li> It is in purely practical terms a very good idea to be nice to people who serve food. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeIsADishBestServed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeIsADishBestServed">If they handle what you eat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">it's not a good idea to make them mad</a>.
</li><li> On a similar note, if your pizza delivery guy is prompt and polite, tip him more than 50 cents. Delivery drivers tend to move even FASTER when they know they'll get a good tip, whereas if they know you'll stiff them, they might make a stopover on the way to your house to get an oil change, do some grocery shopping, maybe solve world hunger so that you never order from them again, <em>you cheap bastard.</em> Also, they will tell their colleagues, and the entire store will drag their feet when your address comes up. As a result of this, a number of pizza chains in the US have started including the delivery tip in the overall bill.

</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeanuReeves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeanuReeves">Keanu Reeves</a> is known to be incredibly friendly towards crew members. Reeves is legendary for being on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">First-Name Basis</a> with all the crew members and has publicly credited his stuntmen by name in interviews and talk show appearances.

<ul><li> <em>Reloaded</em> is where he met stuntman Tiger Chen, and became friends. Reeves later created and directed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfTaiChi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfTaiChi">Man of Tai Chi</a></em> as a vehicle for Chen.
</li><li> Chad Stahelski was Reeves' stunt double on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> and they remained close friends ever since. It was Reeves who lobbied for Stahelski to direct <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick">John Wick</a></em>, believing it to be the perfect film for his friend to make his debut as a cinematic director.

</li><li> Similar to the above example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> was famous for tipping valets and porters in excess of $100. This was at a time when someone working a job like that might make that much in a couple of <em>weeks</em>. A famous anecdote holds that he once asked the kid who brought his car around what the biggest tip he'd ever got was, and the kid responded "$100." Sinatra promptly tipped him <em>$200</em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">asked offhand who had given him the $100 tip.</a> The kid replied, "You did, sir, last week."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> is extremely personable and gracious to waitstaff, as many in the DFW area can attest. If stories are true, the worst he ever demanded of them was keeping up with him on his runs. Those who managed to keep up for three miles in 100 degree weather got a t-shirt. Literally. He likely learned it from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">his father</a>, who was also a very friendly man, especially post-retirement.
</li><li> Military officers in general tend to try and maintain a positive relationship with their soldiers, at least within the US Armed Forces. Lack of rapport with one's troops can ruin a career in pretty short order, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1969602,00.html">here's a case-in-point<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> The more an officer's well being and career is dependent on his enlisted subordinates, the nicer he is to them. This is especially true for pilots, who only at most get the aircraft for just a single hour compared to the many many, often dozens of hours the crew has to spend working on it. Put it this way, being good to people makes them likely to remember you positively and therefore want to repay you for your beneficence. Given the sheer amount of work that ground crews have to do on aircraft, they're only prone to remembering you and therefore your bird if you stand out as being especially nice or especially mean. Being nice might mean that they'll give your plane extra attention, put a bit more effort into it to make it run as best they can, and be more likely to put in reports if something doesn't look all 100% right. Now, if they don't like you, well, sometimes things just don't seem worth fussing over...
</li><li> In addition, people who rely on tips can generally attest that military personnel, particularly officers, tend to be extremely good tippers, whether in or out of uniform. Wait staff often relate stories that when a group of officers are dining together, one will pick up the tab while the rest often throw in enough individually that the total tip will come to more than the meal. If there are busboys, another officer can be expected to specifically leave a tip for them. Among officers, failure to tip properly is regarded as being in extremely poor taste.
</li></ul></li><li> Until about a century ago, the word 'condescending' actually meant this trope. Only later did it pick up the meaning of putting on a <em>facade</em> of being nice, while making it clear that you consider yourself to be bending over backwards to extend undeserved generosity to your inferiors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHiddleston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHiddleston">Tom Hiddleston</a>, renowned as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>, has said his first job was working as a waiter at a country club. After being disgusted by how rude people could be, he has since always made an effort to be polite, especially to "people kind enough to be serving me food".
</li><li> A sort-of-inversion with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudeLaw">Jude Law</a>. While dining out in New York with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicoleKidman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicoleKidman">Nicole Kidman</a>, their waiter waited until after they had finished their meal before approaching them for an autograph. A grateful Law tipped the man a generous $300, saying, "You have waited until our meal was over before asking for that; you are a gentleman."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewCarey">Drew Carey</a> has a reputation for being every waiter's dream customer, and in particular is known for leaving tips well over 100%. This is rather fitting for a guy whose day job is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">giving away furniture, appliances, and the occasional car</a>, and who used to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow">a sitcom</a> about working class life.
</li><li> Shaquille O´Neal is known to tip <em>more than his meal costs</em> as long as the service is decent and to be wonderful around serving staff.
</li><li> A man named Adam Smith also learned about this the hard way in 2012. During the controversy that resulted when the CEO of Chick-Fil-A donated to an anti-gay-marriage organization, Smith recorded himself harassing a drive-thru employee about working for a "bigoted" company. He uploaded the video himself, causing people from both sides of the debate to at least agree on one thing: that Adam Smith was a jerk. He ended up losing his job, and recorded an apology video not long afterwards.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury">Freddie Mercury</a> was remembered fondly by his crew (i.e. roadies, assistants, drivers, etc.), even though most of them acknowledged he did have some tantrums and was in general quite demanding ('he wanted everything done by yesterday'). However, he was still friendly, polite and massively generous — even to other people's staff (e.g., he bought his bandmate's technician a very expensive Christmas present in May just because he thought that particular gift would suit him well) — to the point where everyone was willing to overlook his diva moments. Tea-boys and tea-ladies at the studios where he recorded have also told stories about how nice he was. The rest of the band had a great reputation too.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/lesson-mitt-romneys-47-percent-video-nice-wait-043805916--abc-news-politics.html">This trope may have cost Mitt Romney the 2012 US presidential election.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> A bartender at a fundraising gala had hoped to get a handshake from, or even a picture with, the candidate but Romney ignored the staff completely and made a joke about how the place settings should be cleared faster. The bartender used the digital camera he'd brought with him for pictures to film Romney's infamous 47% remark instead, and eventually gave the footage to <em>Mother Jones</em>. Why had the bartender expected there'd be a photo op for the catering crew? Because he had worked an event where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a> was the keynote speaker, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/12/how-bill-clinton-47-percent-filmmaker_n_2864711.html">Clinton (whose parents both worked low-paid service jobs) ALWAYS makes a point of going back to the kitchens to chat with the staff, thank them for their work, and offer pictures and autographs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Something of an inversion, but in Britain, tipping is slightly less common, especially in low-cost and self-service restaurants — and the percentage of a tip is still more likely to be at the 10% than the 20% end of the scale. You're still expected to be polite, though. This reflects a cultural difference between Britain (and many other places in Europe) and America; unlike America, where the waitstaff heavily depend on tips as part of their income, British waitstaff are usually paid a standard minimum wage which makes tipping slightly more of a bonus than a requirement for the employee in question. (In other countries again, waiting in good restaurants is seen as a downright well-regarded lifetime career and paid accordingly, lending a different tone again to customer-staff relations.)
<ul><li> However, when new minimum wage rules were recently introduced in Britain, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/zizzi-restaurant-cuts-staff-perks-benefits-tips-national-living-wage">some chain restaurants<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/tipping-point-the-restaurants-taking-money-off-their-staff-10441915.html">were reported to be cutting back on staff perks and freebies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to compensate for the hit to their income. This has become something of a minor vexed political topic.
</li><li> To show the disparity of the cultural difference, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenFry">Stephen Fry</a> (who has a reputation for being a lovely gentleman) first dined in America, he didn't tip purely because he didn't know it was required. In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI">QI</a></em> he says he stopped when one day a waiter chased him down after he left, explaining he'd forgotten to tip.
</li></ul></li><li> When she's travelling round the Country, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">Queen Elizabeth II</a> will often insist on being given an opportunity to meet the catering and serving staff to thank them personally for their efforts.
</li><li> Varied customs across countries when it comes to tipping can cause mistaken instances of being mean to waitstaff if you're not aware of it. Most U.S. states, with some of the notable exceptions being California, Nevada, and Washington state, allow for tipped employees to be paid less than the minimum wage provided that wage and tips combined equal or exceed the minimum wage for that jurisdiction. This is commonly known as a "tip credit". In some other cultures, notably in Japan, it's actually considered rude to tip — if you want to show your appreciation to the staff there, buy more food. When travelling to other countries, it's important to keep the local custom in mind — <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Tipping#/media/File:Restaurant_Tipping_Gratuity_World_Map.svg">here's a map guide<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to what's considered standard for a given country.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a> was known to tip well at restaurants. It was said to have done so and quoted as saying "To you its just a couple of bucks. To them, its whether they make rent or not."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://wrestlingdog.tumblr.com/post/97053993139/creaturesandpokemon-reblogger-ocelot">According to Tumblr<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnclePennybags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnclePennybags">Bill Gates</a> once <em>paid off a golf caddy's student loans</em> as a tip. That's probably $10 grand <em>at minimum.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NineteenKidsAndCounting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NineteenKidsAndCounting">Jim Bob Duggar</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://defamer.gawker.com/jim-bobs-punishment-for-masturbators-crazy-duggar-tale-1707675683">has been said to ignore waitresses at restaurants (even shooting some nasty looks), he'd relay his orders to his wife and she'd deliver them to the waitress in question. He also tips 5% after asking for the gratuity to be removed from the bill<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> A blog titled "<a class="urllink" href="http://sundaysaretheworst.com">Sundays Are The Worst<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" is chock full of submissions from waitstaff detailing how badly they've been treated by churchgoers—rudeness, bad tips, religious tracts in lieu of tips, and sanctimonious criticism—"I give the Lord 10%, why should I give you 15?", "You shouldn't be working on God's day.", etc. The founder of the website is a minister who did so to allow these people to vent. He announced his intentions to write personal letters of apology to <em>everyone</em> who posted, and to send them gift cards to help with expenses.
</li><li> A waitress at one of Mario Batali's restaurants was fired after revealing (using somewhat unflattering pseudonyms) how one night the chef's friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">Michael Stipe</a> finally finished his meal at 5 a.m. and left without tipping.
</li><li> The "Ladies/Lords" trend from Mexico, it has become a meme when (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy">sometimes intoxicated</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">upper-class people</a> are caught on a video, which then becomes viral, insulting, berating or shouting at waiters, valets or staff.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieGleason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieGleason">Jackie Gleason</a> had this reputation among the Pullman Porters; he'd tip them a hundred dollars each, turn the whole trip into one big party and actually call them by their names instead of just calling them all George like most people did.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> was famously a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>. The only time he ever punished a child who was in his care was when the boy insulted the maid and declared that it didn't matter because "she's only a servant."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToshiroMifune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToshiroMifune">Toshiro Mifune</a> was famous for his spectacularly volatile temper, and could lash out at co-stars, directors, friends and film company executives at the drop of a hat. However, no crewmember on any film he worked on ever described him as anything other than unfailingly kind, polite and generous. That Toshiro started his film career as a roustabout and knew exactly how rough life at the bottom of the pecking order was helped shape his attitude.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis">Bruce Willis</a> has regularly been named on "Best Celebrity Tippers" lists over the years. This is largely due to his early struggling waiter/bartender days.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCandy">John Candy</a> was loved by just about everyone he worked with. On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NothingButTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NothingButTrouble">Nothing but Trouble</a></em>, he gave the crew personalised gifts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp">Johnny Depp</a> was known for being a very generous tipper. Also, while filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnStrangerTides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnStrangerTides">Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</a></em>, he bought new water proof jackets for five hundred crew members on the set, to protect them from the cold weather, spending a total of 64,200 dollars from his own pocket.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobHoskins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobHoskins">Bob Hoskins</a> bought beer for three hundred plus extras on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook">Hook</a></em> after a lengthy and complicated scene was cut.
</li><li> Mister X of <a class="urllink" href="https://geekjuicemedia.com/">Geek Juice Media<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has often recalled how he was at a party at a con with numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChannelAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChannelAwesome">Channel Awesome</a> producers where the drinks were free and he was the only one who tipped the waitress.
</li><li> Anne of Cleves, fourth wife of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a>. She was noted by contemporary sources to be a particularly kind, generous, and easy-going mistress by her servants. She provided for them in her will, and asked her stepdaughters, Mary and Elizabeth, to employ them in their households after her death.
</li><li> The verbal abuse towards essential workers during the Covid-19 outbreak created the "Karen" meme and its male equivilant "Ken" meme. In the United States and other English-speaking countries, it's a term for a someone perceived as entitled or demanding beyond the scope of what is appropriate or necessary.
