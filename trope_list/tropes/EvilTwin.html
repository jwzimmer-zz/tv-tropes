Typically done with literal twins, these characters are of the same generation, but may have been raised as "cousins", or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth">completely separated from one another</a>. It's especially popular in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a>, where they can use an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalTwinMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalTwinMistake">Identical Twin Mistake</a> to wreak havoc with their Good Twin's life.
</p><p>Typically the evil twin will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo">portrayed by the same actor</a> as the regular character. It's worth noting that in the overwhelming majority of cases the twin is evil; only rarely does an evil character suddenly find themselves contending with a good twin, and in those cases the good version is often simpleminded or purely comic. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsImpotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsImpotent">Good Is Impotent</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpersonatingTheEvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpersonatingTheEvilTwin">Impersonating the Evil Twin</a>.

This often ends with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Match</a> as neither one will be able to convince the other of their ideology. After the fight, their allies will usually need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter">Spot the Imposter</a> to figure out who won.

Even Beerus remarks when watching them fight that despite similar appearances, Black clearly <em>feels</em> different from Goku. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The reason is because Goku Black is the end result after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">one alternate version of</a> the Kaioshin-in-training <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zamasu</a> used the Super Dragon Balls to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">switch bodies with an alternate Goku</a> and killed him</span>.

When one of her assistants is killed in a way that she can't prevent, she discovers the existence of her "sister" Veronica, built to serve as Madaraki's bodyguard. Unlike Fran, who will not condone a person's death if it can be prevented, Veronica will quite enthusiastically kill someone if it benefits her. Fran very quickly shoves a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">Restraining Bolt</a> into Veronica's brain, and she settles into being a devil's advocate for her sister.
<ul><li> Slightly subverted in that "evil" assassin Veronica also believes in giving people quick and merciful deaths (she <em>is</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Cold Sniper</a>) while the "good" Fran will keep people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">alive at any cost,</a> whether she has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">reduce a human being to a head attached to a hand by cramming as many organs as she can into their skull or connect an entire family (that Victoria blew up in the first place) into one giant organism.</a>
</li><li> It is even more subverted if you realize that Veronica isn't that evil - her problem is that she has a very twisted sense of morality. Not entirely her fault since she was created to be an assassin bodyguard in the first place.
</li><li> Gavrill seems to be older than Fran, but in appearance she's Fran gone the path of killing, drugs, crime and cannibalism, with only the clothes, a different hair cut and fangs making the two of them different. Different from her sister, she's a punk Tomboy who roams about the world, killing and stealing. Also, she is a shapeshifter, able to turn herself into a giant wolf-like creature. In recent manga, she's shown to have a soft spot for Amatsuka, so...

(And the only people that <em>didn't</em> buy into that nonsense, namely their parents, died.) This led to their being manipulated into accepting their roles as Seiryuu Seishi.

Extremely bi-polar (which is putting it kindly as she switches constantly back and forth between cutesy, loving little child and homicidal psychopath personalities), and bat-shit insane. Created at the very instant that Hikaru and her fellow Knights were transported back to earth at the end of the first story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nova is actually a small portion of Hikaru's soul given a separate existence and consciousness of its own. Hikaru couldn't cope with all the crushing negative emotions and thoughts brought on by the trauma induced by the first story's ending, and thus her body expelled them all along with a bit of her being, which was given a life of its own via Cefiro's "willpower=reality" system of existence. In the end she accepts her restrained feelings and confronts Nova, which leads them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge">become one person again</a>.</span>

The plan was to have the Mobile Fighter defeat Domon and force him to become its "pilot" (he'd be stuck in it - the AI would do all the fighting) after he ended up nailing four draws in a row.

The Black Saints not only shares the same armor as the protagonists except theirs is black but for unexplained reasons also share the exact same physical appearance as their good counterparts. This is all the most jarring in the case of the Black Phoenix mooks that come in mass and all look exactly the same, that is to say like the main Phoenix. All the attacks of the evil counterparts also are reminiscent of the good ones albeit more evil. For example the attack of Black Pegasus, Ankoku Ryu Sei Ken, is similar to the Ryu Sei Ken of the main Pegasus except it slowly contaminates its victims eventually making them suffocate to death. Likewise, the Black Andromeda's attack has its chains turning into snakes feeding on the victim's blood.

A villain uses an enchanted mirror to create dark duplicates of his victims, including main characters Lina and Naga. The clones are supposed to be the "reverse" of the originals - which, to the bad guy's surprise, means the copies are meek, modest and peaceful, not evil.
</li><li> Takaya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a></em> quite literally has an evil twin.

Apparently, being a guy who's the hero's evil twin means being a genocidal psycho and having a brother complex the size of the Empire State Building. Knives, Cain and Aion are anime's unholy trinity of Evil Twins. The three of them are practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expies</a> of whomever came first. Roshel/Rociel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary">Angel Sanctuary</a></em> is very much like them too, with the difference that Alexiel is female and his non-identical twin.

He later crossed over to a parallel universe, where his brother had become an incredibly powerful and celebrated magus.
<ul><li> When John meets his ancestor Johanna Constantine in her miniseries, it's hinted that it's the Laughing Magician entity that reincarnates in their bloodline that causes them to kill his/her twin in the womb. Later the trope is played straight when his demonic half appears in the comic.

After several battles with the clone, Gina realizes that the reason the clone is trying to kill them is because the curse is inhabiting the clone, motivating its irrational desire to kill them. Her father, an arch-mage, happens to show up in time to dispel the curse, and the clone is invited to join the family and given the name <em>Brianna</em> (a portmanteau of <em>Brittany</em> and <em>Gina</em>). Later on, the Djinn Madrid uses magics to disguise herself as Gina so well she can fool empaths. This backfires though, erasing her original form, and since then, Madrid has been slowly overwritten by Gina, to the point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that a future version of herself traveled to the edge of existence and beyond to save her 'baby sister'</span>

Their leader was Anti-Sonic, the evil twin of Sonic himself, who proved to be very inept - despite helping Alicia (the evil Sally) depose of her father, he hadn't won a single fight since. Amongst his failures were accidentally giving the Sonic Underground Robotnik the Bio Borg instead of Robo-Robotnik and getting struck down by Antoine <em>by accident</em>. Compare this to Anti-Antione (later known as Patch), Antione's evil twin, who successfully replaced Antoine, nearly ruined his relationship with Bunnie, poisoned King Acorn, killed Antoine's father and nearly took the throne before Sonic stepped in. Thankfully, Anti-Sonic got better after he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a> by becoming Scourge.
<ul><li> The Anti-Freedom Fighters got better afterwards when Anti-Sonic became Scourge. After Sonic gives him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>, he decides to apply himself to what he wants to do and undergoes a form of rebirth, to where he no longer resembles Sonic (he turned green from the Master Emerald and got some scars on his chest). He then proceeds <em>conquer</em> Moebius, becoming king and reforming his gang into the Suppression Squad, with all of them taking new names as a result. They attempt a takeover of Mobius, but only get as far as taking over Freedom HQ temporarily. However, their shipshape turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a> as Miles, Tails' Evil Twin, conspires to overthrow Scourge and successfully takes over the Squad. Scourge now leads the Destructix.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash">The Flash</a> (Barry Allen version) had an Evil Twin in the form of Eobard Thawne, who had plastic surgery to resemble him, and then traveled back from the 25th century to become Professor Zoom, the Reverse-Flash. A later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> would reveal that Zoom was descended from Malcolm Thawne, aka Cobalt Blue, who really <em>was</em> Barry's estranged twin brother, but had completely different powers (taught by his adoptive grandmother.)
<ul><li> In the 30th century Eobard's descendant created Inertia, a clone of Barry's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">and his own</a>) grandson Impulse, and sent him back in time to fight his counterpart.
</li><li> For a while after he reformed, Dr. Alchemy (Albert Desmond) seemed to have a psychic twin named Alvin who took up his tools and identity, only becoming the evil twin after Albert became the good one. "Alvin" turned out to be the Philosopher's Stone's physical manifestation of his subconscious desire to continue a life of crime.

Among the more notable examples...
<ul><li> Madelyne Pryor was a clone of the at-the-time deceased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> who was thought to be a normal human who simply had a strong resemblance to Jean (and, in fact, this was the original plan for her), but went insane and discovered her latent telepathic and telekinetic powers when Jean turned up alive and Madelyne discovered her origins.
</li><li> Beast's evil twin from an alternate dimension, known as the Dark Beast, made his way into the mainstream universe and has been a recurring villain since the 1990s. Beast also had at least two other Evil Twins, but they didn't last.
</li><li> Gambit has New Sun, a version of himself from another universe who never got his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a> fixed by Mr Sinister and became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a> as a result. What's more New Sun has actually been killing all alternate versions of himself <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOne">The One</a></em>-style until he was stopped by 616 Gambit.
</li><li> Joseph was a much younger 'copy' of Magneto. Since at the time Magneto was villainous and Joseph was an X-Man, he counts as a <em>Good</em> Twin.
</li><li> At one point half the team was replaced by the shape-shifting aliens known as Skrulls (this was back before everyone was doing it). While most of them remained in captivity while their doubles were running around making trouble, the story culminated in Professor X handing a simultaneous physical and mental beatdown to his double. While naked.
</li><li> Professor X has an actual evil twin, Cassandra Nova. It's later explained that <em>everyone</em> has an evil twin, a psychic construct the Shi'ar call the <em>mummudrai</em> that they face off with before birth. Xavier killed Nova in the womb, but, because she was the Evil Twin of an extremely powerful psychic, she managed to survive as a mass of miscarried fetal tissue and reconstruct herself to the point where she could enact revenge.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cable">Cable</a> and Stryfe, although Cable seems to be the Good Twin. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">It's confusing.</a>

<ul><li> It had a few interesting moments in the 'crossover' issues; one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> had the Human Torch being pursued by doppelgangers of several X-Men, as well as his own 'twin'; Once Torch found out that not a single one of them was human, or even truly alive, he started flash-frying them like popcorn. He ended up missing his own twin, who merely looked at him and said he had no more intention of trying to absorb him, because as he put it before he left, "You're already worse than anything I could ever make you." Thing even later yelled at him that "You ain't no flaming version of the Punisher!" The irony of this is that Torch was one of the few that ended up not being defeated by the doppelgangers in the final issue, whereas the Thing was defeated not even a few minutes later by the dark version of Invisible Woman.
</li><li> Rage of the New Warriors ended up inadvertently absorbing his own twin, which had very little effect on him, surprisingly enough.
</li><li> Most of the Doppelgangers disappeared when the Magus was defeated, but a few survived the crossover and continued to fight their counterparts, including include Spider-Doppelganger (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>), Moonshade (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MoonKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MoonKnight">Moon Knight</a>) and Hellspawn (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersForever">Avengers Forever</a></em> series ends with a no punches pulled battle between every good Avenger that can exist, and every evil Avenger that can exist.

Hauptmann Englande was a cold and ruthless Nazi darling, Meggan had this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness">Baroness</a> thing going on, and Nightcrawler was a rapist; but the most chilling reflection was Jewish Shadowcat, who was a bald, emaciated slave to the regime.
</li><li> Inverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> comic series <em>Kobra</em>, whose eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> <em>was</em> the Evil Twin. His wicked schemes were always foiled by his Good Twin, from whom he'd been separated at birth. Shortly after the series was canceled, Kobra killed off his twin. Recently, however, Kobra himself was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> by a rogue superhero, and his minions have resurrected the good twin, brainwashed him to become evil, and made him the new Kobra.
</li><li> In the final issue of the latest <em>Arkham Asylum</em> miniseries, Jeremiah Arkham meets the Jester. It transpires that the "Jester" is just a projection of what Jeremiah imagines himself to be, under influence of a psychotropic drug given to him by... the Joker.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jester</strong>: Think of me as the Joker's evil twin. <br/><strong>Arkham</strong>: The <em>Joker's</em> evil twin? <br/><strong>Jester</strong>: Scary, ain't it?

Gray Greedy is selfishly hungry for food, eating whatever normal Greedy is eating right out of his hands. Gray Jokey has nastier pranks than normal Jokey. Gray Handy doesn't seem to care about the quality of his work. Gray Smurfette is rather cold and snide towards her normal counterpart. About the only one who doesn't have an issue with his Gray Smurf counterpart is Brainy, who seems to admire how ruthless his other self is in catching Smurfs shirking off on their duties.

(Incidentally, the main characters fail to call Woody on his fake identity when "Rosco" bungles simple facts about his friends but remembers facts about the expected bank shipment in exact detail.)

<ul><li> Vampire Willow and Vampire Xander in "The Wish". Vampire Willow returned in "Doppelgangland" and actually met her good counterpart, making her a better example.
</li><li> The trope was later subverted in <em>The Replacement</em>. A demon's spell, meant for Buffy, hits Xander instead, splitting him in two. He spends the rest of the episode tracking his twin while the twin interacts with his friends and makes various changes to his life. At the end it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that the blast doesn't split you into Good/Bad but only into Strong/Weak. The Xander that the audience thought was the "Good" Xander was actually the "Weak" one and the "Strong" one wasn't doing anything harmful to his life and was actually improving it. The demon's plot hinged on the fact that if one of the twins was killed, both would die. He'd planned to split Buffy into a Slayer powered version and a valley girl version, then kill the latter.</span> In this case, the special effects crew had an easy time getting both Xanders in the same shot. Xander's twin was played by Nicholas Brendon's identical twin brother, Kelly Donovan (who may or may not be evil).

Played straight; Lanie double checks the fingerprints and immediately rules Castle's theory out. While the twins were very different, <em>both</em> were good guys who lacked stage presence.

</li><li> Spock's "evil twin" was terrifyingly cold and ruthless; however, apart from the beard, he actually was identical to his regular universe counterpart, and was simply behaving logically for someone living in an evil empire. When he realizes what's happening, he helps Kirk return to his original universe so he can get his (evil) captain back. Kirk is even able to persuade him to rebel from the empire on moral grounds.
</li><li> In the original show, Spock detects mirror-Kirk almost immediately and confines him, whereas Kirk is able to blend in without arousing suspicion. Spock later speculates that a civilized man can masquerade as a barbarian by simply reverting, but that a barbarian has no core of civilization to draw on.
</li><li> As well as having a double in the Mirror Universe, Kirk also had an android duplicate (<em>What Are Little Girls Made Of?</em>) and an evil double created by a transporter accident (<em>The Enemy Within</em>). The transporter double was an interesting case, as it actually split Kirk into a "Good" <em>and</em> "Evil" version of himself. The good Kirk lacked the strength of purpose to command, while the evil Kirk, while violent, ultimately lacked the moral courage to face the situation. While hating each other, both finally realize they need each other to survive.

</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FantasyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FantasyIsland">Fantasy Island</a></em> once revealed that Mr. Roarke and Tattoo had their own evil (non-identical) twins, who wore black suits with white ties, and had British Accents. Perhaps ironically, the 1998 reboot of <em>Fantasy Island</em> starred British actor Malcolm McDowell, complete with a black suit, as Mr. Roarke. In a seperate episode of the original series called "Look Alikes", a guest (Ken Berry) wishes to meet and exchange places with his (non related) twin (Ken Berry) who he has never met, and who of course turns out to be wanted by some bad guys.
</li><li> The 1970s science fiction parody series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Quark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Quark">Quark</a></em> also hit this trope in an episode called "The Good, The Bad, and the Ficus". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock">Spock-like</a> Ficus, being a plant, had no morality to invert when the crew of the ship was duplicated.

The character of his that fits right in this trope is Evil Jay who appears at every full moon. Years before that, Jay Leno satirized the entire 'evil twin' trope when a guest on Johnny Carson's <em>Tonight Show</em>. Leno had a marked-up <em>TV Guide</em> and showed what seemed like a dozen 'evil twin' themed shows for that one week. There was one on <em>Hawaii Five-O</em>. The bit wrapped with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dynasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dynasty">Dynasty</a></em>, which had Crystal replaced with her 'scheming lookalike', with Jay shouting, "Scheming lookalike?

Unsurprisingly, the process results in a serious Evie and a reckless Evie. The serious Evie is portrayed as the "real" one, at least until Serious-Evie tries to give her speech and discovers that she's now <em>in favor</em> of the dress code.

Reese then recruits Dewey to do a lot of bad things and get the other kid blamed, but by the end of the episode, Dewey tells the other kid's older brother on what's going on and gets Reese beaten up.

</li><li> The renewed series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> had its own unique take on this, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">Latex Perfection</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em> once had an interesting take on this. There was once a character named Grant Putnam who was revealed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> for the Soviet Union. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> redeems him and after helping to dispense with his comrades, continues his life. Eventually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> real Grant Putnam recovers from amnesia. At first it seems he's evil due to the trauma of nearly dying and spending years in an asylum, but it's revealed that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a> and had originally murdered his brother in order to have his brother's fiancé, who's now married to the Russian.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive">One Life to Live</a></em> had an aversion with Mortimer Bern, the good twin to crime lord Carlo Hesser. However, he didn't stay good once Carlo's lover Alex propped him up to take over Carlo's criminal empire (although he did get better)...
</li><li> Another well-known American soap opera example is Andre DiMera from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a>.</em> Andre was given plastic surgery to make him look like his cousin Tony at the contrivance of the man Tony grew up believing was his father, crime lord/practical supervillain Stefano DiMera. At Stefano's behest and while Tony was kept secretly imprisoned, Andre while impersonating Tony became a serial killer just to frame an enemy of Stefano's, although Stefano ended up betraying him once Andre's killing spree included Stefano's own daughter (although that didn't stop Stefano many years later getting Andre to pretend to be Tony <em>again</em>!).
</li><li> The short lived TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Two" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Two">2</a></em> was based on this concept.

Whether or not they're evil is up to debate.
<ul><li> Interestingly, there is one prominent alternate universe character who did not have a counterpart in "our" universe for the longest time. Finally, a "good" version (who looks a little nerdy in glasses) shows up... for a single episode. He returns as a regular in the following season.
</li><li> In a more straight version of this trope, there's a season 4 episode where the Fringe Divisions from both universes are working together to catch a serial killer in the alt-universe, with the help of his counterpart from the prime-universe, who thanks to a woman he met in his childhood, becomes able to contain his psychotic urges and avoid the crime path, such luck his alternate did not have.

Galina is a patient in a Minsk mental institution and is prone to violent outbursts. Russian government officials (presumably, with permission from the Belarus authorities) take her to a secret location and turn her into a look-alike for Olga, the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist">Hot Scientist</a> on the show.

Namely Parker, who spends many episodes unsuccessfully trying to get Olga into bed suddenly finds her trying to jump him.
<ul><li> A more conventional version was also done in this series.

There are also inversions: criminals from Earth-1 have heroic or neutral-aligned versions in Earth-2.

As with Earth-2, there are exceptions: Leonard Snart is morally ambiguous in Earth-1, but his counterpart in Earth-X is a clearly heroic character.

</li><li> During the mid-2006, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> was embroiled in a feud with an "Imposter Kane" to coincide with a <em>May 19th</em> angle that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">set Kane off if anyone mentioned the date to him</a>, (as well as the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SeeNoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SeeNoEvil">See No Evil</a></em>). No one knew a thing about the Imposter except that he had a history of sorts with Kane that made him fear him. Ultimately because of how much it confused fans (and after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">Kane lost in a squash match between the two at a PPV</a>), the feud was scrapped and Kane promptly disposed of the Imposter on an episode of RAW and the angle was never mentioned again.
</li><li> The first women's champion of Pro Championship Wrestling Chicago, Super J, had an evil twin in Fallan, who resented the fact she was born without superpowers. Super J wasn't <em>completely</em> good though, as she openly admitted the PCW Women's title was the one thing she'd compromise her moral values to regain.

Normally Brie would be the face and Nikki would be the heel. Particularly noticeable on NXT when Nikki kept trying to make Brie pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch">Twin Switch</a> against her will. In 2012 going into <em>WrestleMania 28</em> this time Brie was the Evil Twin, supporting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">John Laurinitis</a> while Nikki supported Teddy Long.

Once Sin Cara got better, WWE worked the replacement into a storyline where he was the imposter and was getting back at Sin Cara for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Mistico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Mistico">stealing his identity</a>". The Trope came to a head when the Imposter started doning a black suit similar to the Original Sin Cara, giving himself the alias of "<em>Sin Cara Negro</em>".

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ScarredLands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ScarredLands">Scarred Lands</a></em>, the goddesses of Good and Evil are twins.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>, Evil Twin is a disadvantage a character can take for additional points. The disadvantage makes the PC have to take the fall for things his evil twin does, as well as other characters thinking that the PC is crazy, or has a split personality. Interestingly, the Evil Twin has this disadvantage as well, and occasionally the Evil Twin will be blamed for something the PC did. And if you play an evil character with this disadvantage, you have to worry about getting the credit for your "Good" Twin doing things like saving orphanages.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has a variation: There's an entire <em>race</em> called dopplegangers, who can shapeshift into any similarly sized humanoid-including other people.
</li><li> <em>D&amp;D</em> loves this trope. It also had the Mirror of Opposition, which spawned an Evil Twin of anyone who looked at it (the twin then immediately tried to kill and replace the original), the spell Simulacrum (a physically identical but less-powerful duplicate of the target, absolutely loyal to the caster) and its big brother Ice Assassin, and at least two different takes on the "magically created copy of you trying to kill you" in monster form, the nastier of which had the horrifying combination of being more powerful than the original and <em>totally invulnerable to anyone else's attacks</em>.
</li><li> One of the most horrific ways to create one is via the corrupt spell Searing Seed, found in the 300th issue of Dragon Magazine. It actually impregnates the victim, causing said victim to bring an unholy infant to term within minutes, inflicting a great deal of damage due to the incredibly fast pregnancy and birth. (It can be cast on a male victim, and if so, he takes even more damage, as a male body is not made for such a thing. The half-fiend infant grows to adulthood within minutes and becomes a duplicate of its "parent", its primary goal from then on being to kill the parent. (Assuming the victim survived, of course.)
</li><li> Skulks are a similar race who are far more malicious, doing it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">frame innocent people for evil deeds</a> then watching with sadistic delight as the victim they impersonated faces the punishment for whatever they did.
</li><li> Hextor, the god of Tyranny and War, is the Evil Twin of Heironeous, the god of Chivalry and Justice. Not exactly a straight example, as they look nothing alike.

(It can also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">switch the souls of two victims into each others' bodies</a>, or worst of all, combine two souls into <em>one</em> body; the idea of having to share a body with your rival or hated enemy could well be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>.)

All Fetches are incomplete, though, meaning they lack <em>something</em> of the original. When that something is empathy or a sense of right and wrong, then you've got an Evil Twin. Things get more complicated if they merely lack your alcoholism or bitterness, though. It works both ways. Fetches don't know they're not the original person, so when someone shows up who looks like a monsterous version of them (and nobody else can see the monsterous things, and thinks it looks <em>exactly</em> like them, but a different age), who hates their guts and has strange magical powers, they are perfectly justified to think they are the victim of this trope.

<ul><li> The machine change is justified: The scientists that cloned Falcon realized Blood would have no chance against the Captain if they had identical machines: Captain Falcon is just way too skilled with his vehicle.

Because of this, the Evil Twin in this case has more attitude and is much more badass much of the time. Of course, he does have the drawback of being compulsively evil for its own sake and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first segment of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E1TreehouseOfHorrorVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E1TreehouseOfHorrorVII">Treehouse of Horror VII</a>", Bart and Lisa discover an evil twin of Bart, named Hugo, living in the attic and obsessed with "reuniting". Their parents and Dr. Hibbert admit that the boys were born <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConjoinedTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConjoinedTwins">conjoined</a>, but were separated at birth and Hugo was locked away after they realized he was evil. However, it's subverted when Hibbert looks at their scars and realizes that Bart is, and always has been, the evil one ("Oh, don't look so shocked"). The segment ends with their situation reversed, Hugo being accepted into the family while Bart is locked in the attic and fed nothing but fish heads.
</li><li> Mr. Burns also fits the trope, even if the only thing known about his twin (who never appeared in the series) is that he/she died from being shot. It's heavily implied Burns was behind his twin's death (and the deaths of all their other siblings) to inherit his parents' whole fortune as he told the tales of their demises to Bart Simpson, who was masquerading as Simon Woosterfield as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceAndPauper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceAndPauper">Prince and Pauper</a> plot.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em> has Sofia creating a clone of herself in a pink dress to play with a visitor while she goes to a hootenanny, but the clone turns out to be this. Clover finds out that Sofia did something wrong when he takes a bite out of an apple she cloned and finds that it's rotten.
</li><li> This was effectively parodied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Spookyfish", in which Cartman's Evil Twin was soft spoken, considerate, and generous, so Stan and Kyle try to send the "real" Cartman back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> instead.
<ul><li> Another episode had Stan cloned. Despite having one arm longer than the other, a giant head, and only saying, "Me Stan, bah-chewy-chomp, bah-chewy-chomp, bah-chewy-chomp," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HughMann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HughMann">everyone thought it was him when it escaped and went on a rampage.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In the cartoon version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceAce">Space Ace</a></em>, besides Hexter in the games, Dexter has a <em>second</em> evil clone named Baby Face Nerks, who looks like Dexter, but does not energize, and also wears a cowboy hat and wears a bandana around his neck. He appears in "Wanter Dexter!".
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhost">Space Ghost</a></em> series had a straight example of this, with the evil "Space Spectre" crossing over for one episode from a parallel universe. No evil twins of Space Ghost's friends, however, since Space Spectre works alone, a fact pointed out by Space Ghost as the reason he was able to defeat Spectre.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast">Space Ghost Coast to Coast</a></em> episode "Switcheroo" (the one in season 3, not 4) introduces Space Ghost's Evil Twin brother Chad... who, of course, has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil">goatee</a>.
</li><li> Spider-Carnage of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaTestBaddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaTestBaddie">Beta Test Baddie</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> par excellence. "I'm more you than you'll ever admit!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StuntDawgs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StuntDawgs">Stunt Dawgs</a></em> villain Richard P. Fungus and his insane twin brother R. Peter Fungus.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)</a></em>: The episode "Donatello's Duplicate" has Donatello make a duplicate of himself to help with his labwork so he can have some more time to relax. Unfortunately for him, the twin is an egotistical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, who eventually sides with a gangster who wants to rule the city, so the twin builds a second duplicator to create copies of rats to swarm the city. The Turtles eventually confront the evil Donatello during the climax, who uses the duplicator on the rest of the team to make evil duplicates of them as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">The Tick</a></em> has Mucus Tick, an evil clone created by inter-dimensional horror Thrakkazog from a tissue, or rather Kleenex, sample taken from The Tick when he had a cold. Mucus Tick was, appropriately, green and amorphous. The sample was taken from a clone of Arthur, which among its most telling features is that it could only say, "I Arthur." The Tick considered that a rather compelling argument when it came time to determine which one was real.
<ul><li> Furthermore, Arthur seems to have an entire race of evil clones in an alien species called the Hey that coincidentally dresses exactly like him, has a language consisting entirely of the word "Hey," and literally worship nothing to the point of wanting to destroy everything.
</li><li> Hey propaganda is patently hilarious to hear, because to the human ear it sounds less like inspiring prose and more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses">jaded, cynical hogwash</a>. "Nothing is worth living for. Nothing is worth fighting for. Nothing is beautiful." You get the idea.
</li><li> Arguably, Tick also has "Barry Tick," who is similar only in theme and they wind up fighting each other over who gets to use their name.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em> had a black version of Optimus Prime appear when they briefly jumped dimensions for...some reason. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Actually it was Sideways, but still an evil twin.</span>
<ul><li> In a number of canons, "Scourge" and "Nemesis Prime" are an evil, black repaint of Optimus Prime.
</li><li> A Botcon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> comic features the Stunticons, destructive Decepticon clones from miscellaneous Autobots (and Lockdown, who's <em>already</em> pretty slaggin' evil.) Toxitron, the one based on Optimus, is a pastiche of Bizarro.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, Dr. Venture himself can be considered the evil twin to his brother Jonas Jr., whom he consumed in the womb. While Jonas Jr. is meant to be the true heir to Jonas Sr. and is the superior scientist, Rusty is a failed scientist who has shown himself to be amoral, having created a Joy Can out of an orphan's heart and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster">Frankenstein's Monster</a> out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> that his bodyguard killed as well as being generally a horrid father who seems to show mostly disdain for his own sons (though this might be related to the fact that they are shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> at times).
<ul><li> He even tries and fails to kill a successful, non bald doppelganger of himself from an alternate reality.
</li><li> Though it does seem to rattle Dr. Venture when Henry Killinger (and his magic murder bag) assume he'd make a good supervillain/arch-nemesis for his brother. He turns it down when he realizes it, despite that his compound is so much more efficient that way.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WidgetTheWorldWatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WidgetTheWorldWatcher">Widget the World Watcher</a></em> had an evil twin from another dimension, Ratchet the World Trasher.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wishfart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wishfart">Wishfart</a></em> parodies this in a manner similar to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> example above. When a wishing accident causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> versions of Dez, Puffin, and Akiko to enter their universe, Dez and his friends initially assume them to be their evil twins. However, Alternate!Puffin points out that it's pretty evil of them to make such a nasty assumption so quickly.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dez:</strong> You're right. Id say we look just as evil, if not more evil, than these evil doppelgangers.
</div></li><li> Not actually evil, per se, but Will and Yan Lin gain twins thanks to Nerissa during the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>. Will's fights back when she realizes that the real Will is trying to reabsorb her (due to the fact that she's a projection from the Heart of Candracar given sentience), but ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a> when Nerissa attacks, willingly allowing Will to reabsorb her. Yan Lin's goes rogue when Nerissa threatens to take away her sentience if she didn't join her. Unlike Will's, Yan Lin's lives on and the real Yan Lin passes her duplicate off as her never-before-seen twin sister.
</li><li> Ranger Smith of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear">Yogi Bear</a></em> fame had a literal twin known as Slippery Smith. Being a fugitive for unspecified crimes (probably mostly theft) was bad enough, but forcibly swapping clothes with his brother and throwing him out to the cops was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>. Thankfully (if unsurprisingly), Slippery Smith did not appear in more than one episode.
