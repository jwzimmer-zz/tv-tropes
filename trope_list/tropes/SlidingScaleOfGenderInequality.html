<p>This scale examines how the relationships between men and women are portrayed in fiction. The common positions on the scale vary by culture in time, distance, and medium.
</p><p>True equality, which is near the center of the scale, is rare. The edges are taken by positions where the opposite sex doesn't exist or exists in only a contemptible form. Note that Level 1 is not the exact reverse of Level 9, as there are far fewer works in which the writer simply fails to include male characters, or in which a setting is intentionally created as a female-free paradise.

<p></p><h1>There Are No Women</h1>
There are no female characters in the story, or there are very few, but they serve as nothing more than background for the male character and don't do anything of note. None of them are more than a minor character. There may be nothing sexist about it—there can be a legitimate reason for the lack of women, such as stories being set in places where women are not allowed (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">men's prison</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DasBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DasBoot">WWII-era military submarine</a>, etc.) This is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromosomeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromosomeCasting">Chromosome Casting</a>.

</p><ul><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi">Ai no Kusabi</a></em> to justify its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay">Cast Full of Gay</a>.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Crows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Crows">Crows</a></em> and <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Worst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Worst">Worst</a></em> by Hiroshi Takahashi feature no females whomsoever aside from occasional mentions (one of the main characters has no less than 6 girlfriends). This is a seinen manga about inter-school fighting and manly friendship and, despite the premise, even the most rabid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Yaoi Fangirl</a> would be hard-pressed to get any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> out of it.
</li><li> Likewise, the satirical manga and anime series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool">Cromartie High School</a></em>. The mother of one character is seen in at least one episode... And "she" looks <em>exactly</em> like her son but with a skirt and longer hair.
</li><li> There's not a female character in site in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubLove">Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubHappyKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubHappyKiss">Cute High Earth Defense Club Happy Kiss!</a></em>, which is ironic since they have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> vibe going on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji">Kaiji</a></em>. There is one woman on the show, but she only appears in a single scene in one episode and says no more than two lines. Averted in the movie adaptations, in which a handful of female characters are featured.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi">Akagi</a></em> has zero women onscreen in the entire show.

</p><ul><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a></em> books feature no significant female characters and in the series as a whole only Bianca Castafiore can be considered an important female; and she's relevant to the plot in only a few of the stories.
</li><li> Similarly, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlakeAndMortimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlakeAndMortimer">Blake and Mortimer</a></em> stories written by their original author E.P Jacobs feature a grand total of one female character who got more than a few lines—and she was a literal medieval <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> episode, who appeared during one-third of the story. Authors who took over the series after Jacobs' death have been adding more female characters to the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> had a hundred main characters, none of them female, at first. While Gargamel created the Smurfette early on (third book or so, meaning the seventh adventure overall), she wasn't a regular character, just appearing as a guest character or being name-dropped in a few books. This was eventually dropped by "The Smurf Olympics" when the Smurfette moved to the Smurf Village by the end of the story and Sassette was created two books later, thus turning the book into the namer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">The Smurfette Principle</a>.

</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamcatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamcatcher">Dreamcatcher</a></em>: A stranger in the street early on and numerous extras in the military camp are the only women in the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></em> has precisely one female in the movie, a secretary, who is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a> centrefold.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gettysburg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gettysburg">Gettysburg</a></em>: There is talk of wives left behind, but the only women that actually appear in the film are either waving to the troops or tending the wounded in the background.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GlengarryGlenRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GlengarryGlenRoss">Glengarry Glen Ross</a></em> depicts salesmen in a company with all male employees.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></em>: A prostitute appearing in a single scene is the most important female character and the only one given a name. Every last woman in the film besides her is someone's wife, and all their appearances are within the first hour of the nearly 3-hour film. Rape, incidentally, is on Tuco's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList">Long List</a> of prior offenses, which is entirely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> (and is one of the crimes he may or may not have made up, anyway). In any case, it is mentioned offhand that the bandido <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Gets Around</a> and has been married at least once.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForAFewDollarsMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForAFewDollarsMore">For a Few Dollars More</a></em> has one credited woman who only appears in two brief scenes, and one girl who only appears in a flashback and has no lines
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DuckYouSucker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DuckYouSucker">Duck, You Sucker!</a></em> has one woman who appears in flashback with no lines, and the only other woman is an annoying racist who is out of the picture in the first 15 minutes.
</li><li> The British monster movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gorgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gorgo">Gorgo</a></em> is mocked for this by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">MST3K</a> crew. The only woman who appears is in the background of a crowd scene.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em>. Famously used as an example of why failing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBechdelTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBechdelTest">The Bechdel Test</a> doesn't automatically makes a movie misogynistic since it takes place during a military campaign in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MasterAndCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MasterAndCommander">Master and Commander</a></em>, the only women that appear in the film are part of a party of native traders that resupply HMS Surprise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em>. There are three women in the movie: the waitress who doesn't meet Pink's tipping standards (who is never seen), the girl that Mr. Pink pulls out of the car while running from the cops, and the driver of the hijacked car that shoots (and is immediately killed by) Orange.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em>, being set in a men's prison, has only Andy's barely-glimpsed murdered wife, from whom he was estranged anyway, and a few extras when Brooks and Red are paroled. A good case could be made that the poster and film clips of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RitaHayworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RitaHayworth">Rita Hayworth</a> are the film's strongest female presence; an even better case could be made that this is why it flopped, despite nigh-universal critical acclaim.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter">John Carpenter</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing1982">The Thing (1982)</a></em>. No women among the main cast and the only female presences are a chess computer that's out of commission 30 seconds after the introductory scene of R.J. MacReady, and a 10-second glimpse of a female contestant in some game show the two mechanics are watching. This may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, however; there aren't many women stationed in Antarctica.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveAngryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveAngryMen">12 Angry Men</a></em>. The only characters are the members of an all-male jury. Some modern versions try to correct this by making the judge a woman. Others simply opt to retitle the play "Twelve Angry Jurors" just so that some of the jury can be women.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyDinnerWithAndre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyDinnerWithAndre">My Dinner with Andre</a></em> is a very minimalist film with only two main characters: both men. A wife is mentioned and women are seen in the restaurant but it focuses on the two male leads.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em> is a very male-dominated movie. We do see women working in space, though largely as stewardesses, secretaries, and other stereotypically female professions. Dr. Floyd does speak to two female scientists, but the group conducting the lunar expedition as well as the <em>Discovery</em> crew are both made up entirely of men. Arthur C. Clarke's sequel novels, especially <em>2010: Odyssey Two</em>, incorporate more strong female characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan">Saving Private Ryan</a></em> has only a brief scene where the group encounters a French family and the final scene with Ryan and his wife. The plot is also kicked off by a nameless woman typing up the condolence letters, and Ryan's mother appears briefly.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape">The Great Escape</a></em> has an all-male main cast. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a>, as it is set in a WWII POW camp, where there generally were not many women. There were talks about including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> in the cast, but it never happened.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagnificentSeven1960" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagnificentSeven1960">The Magnificent Seven</a></em>: all the titular seven are males, the villain is male and most of the supporting cast are male. Petra, Chico's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance">Token Romance</a>, is the only female with a speaking part. Surprisingly when it was remade as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMagnificentSeven1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMagnificentSeven1998">TV series</a>, they didn't give one of the seven a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> but instead included a female journalist as a significant character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dunkirk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a></em> focuses on the evacuation of the male soldiers from the eponymous city, as well as the (also entirely male) civilians and fighter pilots who come to their aid.

This hurdle doesn't stop you from including women in motion-captured cutscenes and the like, so many developers partially avert this by having female characters in prominent supporting roles (e.g. Cortana, Anya, and the female helicopter pilot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a> 4</em>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyAdvancedWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyAdvancedWarfare">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a></em> features the first female squadmate who runs around with you on the ground since <em>Call Of Duty: Finest Hour</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">although she's the only woman</a> who does that in the entire game, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyGhosts">two </a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyAdvancedWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyAdvancedWarfare">games </a> in the franchise allow you to play as a female soldier in multiplayer.

Men hold nearly all the positions of authority, and the few women that have any authority are either useless or psychotic.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Machete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Machete">Machete</a></em> is guilty to the extreme of this trope, border lining on the Level 2 above.

The Westerosi society is patriarchal and sexist (except Dorne, see below) which had several incompetent, evil, and insane men leading their houses sidelining their more stable female relatives behind. This is brought by the ancient civil war, Dance of the Dragons, where Rhaenyra Targaryen's defeat by her brother Aegon II, led to stricter laws of agnetic-cognetic succession despite that she is her father's chosen heir. There are female leaders such as Cersei Lannister and Daenarys Targaryen; however, they were still looked down upon by their sex. For Cersei's case, her rule in the fourth book <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after her father's death</span> made things worse which got herself arrest for adultery and forced to walk on the streets naked as punishment. Dany may be the last Targaryen heiress but many men attempted to woo her because of her looks, her dragons, or both. Action girls such as Brienne of Tarth and Asha Greyjoy are looked down which is also seen in the backstory where one girl went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Sweet Polly Oliver</a> to join the Night's Watch; but since it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores">Army of Thieves and Whores</a>, she got a horrible ending. Of course, there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a> tactic deployed by Tywin Lannister and Ser Gregor Clegane during the War of the Five Kings. In essence, it's a story set in a world where women are meant to know their place, but a narrative that very much depicts them as equals.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em>, this is the general view in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Northern Confederation</a> and among its allies. The collapse of the decadent and corrupt United States and its Godless liberalism put an end to the illusions of political correctness and female equality, and in the new, Godly order, women are expected to know their place. This attitude is also influenced by the fact that their worst enemy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">Lady Land</a>.

The writers defended this decision as being a story that could only be told with the gender disparity, but that justification has only fueled further debate. Further controversy came about when the story revealed that most of the female cast are either inactive non-combatants, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">damsels-in-distress</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">fanservice</a>, or a combination of the three, and the sole playable female character (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aranea</span>) is only playable for a brief time and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">disappears from the story entirely during the final act, as we're only told of what she'd been doing in the interim</span>.

Almost every bandit, thug, henchman, and soldier Geralt encounters is male, the vast majority of important women are young and beautiful while most important men are tough and weathered. Most heads of state are men, and that continues all the way down to local barons and village ealdormen.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze">Texhnolyze</a></em> may belong here. There are only two female characters in major plot roles, Doc and Ran. And while they are perfectly good at the jobs they perform (and Doc is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>, which is an unusual role for a woman), both of them answer to men.

You can't justify it by male dogs being bigger and stronger than females because Weed, the protagonist of the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed">Ginga Densetsu Weed</a>,</em> is small and not even fully grown, certainly far smaller than an average fully-grown adult female, but is portrayed as being one of the best fighters nonetheless. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lqyk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1lqyk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lqyk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The narrative makes it's obvious this is all due to the author's sexism; we get a line from Cross saying that she loves babies because she's female followed by her diving off a cliff to save a random unrelated puppy (this would have been fine if any of the males would have been willing to do the same thing), a male dog about to become a father admitting to preferring having a son and being backed up by other males, and almost all of the few females shown all end up being damsels in distress, including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">random female "warrior"</a> who gets captured the very next scene after being introduced just because the plot needed someone to cause the fight to go wrong. </span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a> winds up here. Women like Melk the Second and Rin are shown to be quite capable at their own jobs (neither of which is typical feminine work), and a few other competent women are sprinkled here and there, but they all get very little screentime compared to the main male cast.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan">Bakugan</a> is an odd case. It originally started off as Level 5, with a balanced main cast of males and females and both genders participating in the plot. However, starting with the second season (<em>New Vestroia</em>), all the major female characters were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>, and the new cast became more male-dominated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">The Smurfette Principle</a> mostly in effect, causing the show to slide back into Level 4.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> tends to zig-zag between this and Almost Perfect Equality. While there are relatively fewer female characters of any prominence, women are shown to be all over the place, ranging from submissive ladies in waiting to skillful bureaucrats. It also depends on the faction, with the FPA tending towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject">Gender Is No Object</a>, though even the more patriarchal Empire has a number of formidable women. Essentially it's the opposite of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, showing a galaxy where gender is treated quite equally but narratively there's little more than one or two token females on any given side (with a cast that's the poster boy for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em>, Zoe/Izumi is the only female member out of the 6 spirit warriors, and she loses in every fight against her male opponents (even when she gets her spirit evolution, she still has to be saved by Takuya) and only winning against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight">lone female enemy</a> Ranamon. A massive step back compared to the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">three</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">animes</a> before it, where there are more female characters and they are just as competent and characterized as the males.
<ul><li> Another issue besides her satellite "nice girl" personality is that she is treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a>, not only in appearance but also the series as well where every single male is attracted to her. When it overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">Faux Action Girl</a>, it creates a really awkward combination that leaves her an unpopular character.

</p><ul><li> Many manly action movies such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir">Con Air</a></em>, which had two women with supporting roles: they were the protagonist's wife and the female prison guard.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> movies where the Bond Girl is his professional equal, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouOnlyLiveTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouOnlyLiveTwice">You Only Live Twice</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpyWhoLovedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpyWhoLovedMe">The Spy Who Loved Me</a></em>, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies">Tomorrow Never Dies</a></em>. They might still need rescuing in the climax, but they're not constant damsels in distress. However, Aki in <em>You Only Live Twice</em> is never shown fighting and is mostly viewed as a pretty piece of scenery, and while Kissy is shown to be physically capable, she spends most of the climax cowering behind Tiger Tanaka.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> (the original trilogy, anyway) Princess Leia had a less active role than the major male characters and only played a major combat role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>. Even there, Han rather than her led the Endor strike force even though she'd been with the Rebellion a lot longer and was among its top leaders. All the fighter pilots in all three movies were male, and the only other female character, Mon Mothma, was in a leadership but non-combat role (though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> reveals she is the leader of the Rebellion, former Senator representing her homeworld, etc.)
</li><li> Lynn Redgrave's character in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern">Spaghetti Western</a> <em>Viva la muerte... tua!</em> is a perfectly capable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> reporter who saves the men's lives multiple times, yet sadly doesn't get the respect she deserves in the end.

</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> may fit here: although most of the characters are men, the few female characters that exist are very strong personalities and in Galadriel's case, quite powerful. This probably explains why Arwen is written to be significantly more badass in the first film, although she suffers from Chickification later on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CourtshipRite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CourtshipRite">Courtship Rite</a></em> has a society much like ours in this respect (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">very different in others</a>). Some clans are blatantly sexist, while others profess a more egalitarian view. Still, even in the more open-minded clans, it seems like it's <em>mainly</em> men in positions of power and mainly men who do the fighting.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em>, the battle school seems to have no problems recruiting kids of either gender, but it's stated that boys tend to get accepted more often than girls. That said, the one girl we do see is treated more or less as equal, at least by Ender.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy">Kushiel's Legacy</a></em> zigzags back and forth from Whores, Whores, Whores to this. From a Watsonian perspective, most of the female characters such as Phedre and Melisandre are skilled at manipulation, diplomacy, espionage, and politics. Terre d'Ange has a Queen and they don't discriminate between genders since it's a land of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalSexualFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalSexualFreedom">Eternal Sexual Freedom</a> and prostitution is treated with respect. But from a Doylist perspective, they're not exactly equal in gender since most of the D'Angeline female characters we've encountered are good at sex, implying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful">All Women Are Lustful</a>, and there's a lack of female warriors. Phedre is a courtesan whose only job is to spy and seduce regardless of gender and there are several times when she was raped and tortured. Outside of Terre d'Ange, the women weren't treated very well and prostitutes are treated like second-class citizens. It gets worse when Imriel becomes the POV character and several major female characters including Phedre are demoted to secondary characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle">The Kingkiller Chronicle</a></em> lands squarely here. Women are not disparaged or overtly forced into roles, but they tend to be in traditional or support positions while men do all the real work. There are no female public figures, traders, crafters, or instructors, but several barmaids and artists. A common criticism of the first book, <em>The Name of the Wind</em>, is that all of the women the protagonist encounters are attractive, and so some attempts were made to rectify this in the sequel, <em>The Wise Man's Fear</em>, which makes some clear attempts to create females to directly equal and occasionally exceed male counterparts, and also some that aren't described as physically attractive. Nevertheless, the males are always more powerful and prominent in the end.

</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> is here. The vast majority of the important characters are male, and one of the select prominent female ones is sometimes known as a "sex kitten". Others include the first lady's Chief of Staff who's then director of legislative affairs, the president's executive secretary, the deputy chief of staff who's Josh's love interest, and a prominent one as press secretary. But at the end of the day, it's the men who are the leaders who most of the action is around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>.

Of the three women in the main cast at the start of the series, the only one in a combat role was quickly written out when her actress decided to leave the show, unhappy with the way her character was being written. The other two, while influential and highly respected crew members, are both medical professionals who rarely see action, and Counselor Troi is widely considered to be one of the more useless officers.
<ul><li> Note that the combat woman was not written as sexist, but more as a one-note character.

All the Knights are male, like in the traditional legends, Arthur himself voices some sexist views, and a good chunk of the women met throughout the show are damsels in distress. However, the two female leads, Morgana and Guinevere, are both shown to be capable. Guinevere in particular (who's probably the best and most consistent example of female empowerment here) joins Merlin and Arthur's adventures on many occasions. Morgana's competence goes in and out, but there are still episodes where she can put on a good showing. We also meet other women, like Morgouse and Isolde, who are established warriors, and there's plenty of female villains.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> is at this level. Almost all Kamen Riders are male, while the female characters tend to be either battle support or emotional support to the male heroes. Even if a female has fighting capabilities, they don't manage to have much impact on a battle. There are a handful of female Kamen Riders, who mostly only appear for one movie or episode, during which they either lose their powers or die.

Detective Lilly Rush is the only female member in the main team but it was stated several times that she was the only female detective in Philadelphia. Or at least, the only female <em>homicide</em> detective in Philadelphia.

The eighth episode focuses on their relationship which, in turn, also shows John's death in Iwo Jima near the end.

Space Marines, the Primarchs, the Emperor, and at least 3 of the Chaos Gods are male. Most factions employ men for combat. On the other hand, the Adeptus Sororitas are all-female and the Imperial Guard features equal amounts of men and women (not that one would notice from the official minis though). Xenos races are usually more equal and have more visibly female models. When it comes to background, however, women are much more favourably positioned in general, bordering on true equality (sexism is still an issue, but usually presented as something bad that has to be fixed).

Most important NPCs are male even then. It's also worth pointing out that two of the three female party members have storylines revolving around their feelings for Cloud, and the third has a more neutral story but has a crush on Cloud too. There is a really terrifying female villain but she is literally used as body parts by the male villain, who dismembers her and can act his will through those parts of her body.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully">Bully</a></em> has the males dominating the plot of the game, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">lone females</a> of each cliques being treated as mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> for the lead male, and unable to even put up any fight when they are being attacked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a></em>: In contrast to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Sengoku Basara</a></em>, <em>Warriors</em> has <em>fourteen</em> female playable characters as of <em>Samurai Warriors: The Spirit of Sanada</em> and the recent games have individual storylines for some of them (such as Koshosho, Lady Hayakawa and Gracia Hosokawa). Unlike <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>, several female characters do make contributions in the battlefield and they have female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> who are guarding them. However, in history, the women of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuPeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuPeriod">Sengoku Period</a> rarely played significant roles except a few (such as Kai, Ii Naotora, Gracia among others) which is why their storylines in the games are mostly fictional.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SagaFrontier2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SagaFrontier2">Saga Frontier 2</a></em> is set in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a>. Among the nobility, women are pretty much marriage pawns. The only woman to do <em>anything</em> political on her own steam is the villainous Nicolette, and she's largely an ineffective schemer who started a war because of a petty grudge. There <em>are</em> women in the national armies in large numbers, but no noblewomen (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess">Rebellious Princess</a> Primiera, who left home to become a digger) warriors are seen. There's much more equality among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">diggers</a>, and the main character of the third generation is Virginia Knights, but even then, both female diggers we see getting married or pregnant settle down to become full-time mothers.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored">Dishonored</a></em> has a handful of female characters, most of whom do very little; The women allied to you don't participate in planning, most neutral women are maids, and the one villainess there is merely providing funding to the villains. The empress is killed in the first 5 minutes and her daughter does little else than getting kidnapped. The DLC is a bit better, as the main villain faction consists only of witches and Daud's second-in-command is a woman. Interestingly, the developers realized after the games' release how awkward their representation of women was, and the games' two sequels both have female protagonists, and <em>2</em> in particular has plenty of female characters as allies, mooks, and villains, moving it to the "almost equal" tier.

<p></p><h1>Almost Perfect Equality</h1>
Stories that portray both sexes as an equal or are at least trying to balance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>. Both men and women may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a>. It's almost impossible to achieve a perfect balance of both sexes, especially in stories aimed for one specific audience (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic">Shonen</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic">Shoujo</a>)—sometimes girls don't get full respect only because the story is just too focused on boys and vice versa. That's why many of the examples here are works that, while it is still impossible to tell whether they portray both sexes as completely equal, are just more balanced than Level 4 or 6.

ARC-V</a></em> has brought back many fans to the franchise, one of the main reasons has been is how well handled girls are in the series. To summarize you get a main girl who not just gets as much development as the protagonist, she is a pivotal part of the plot, and she has a number <em><strong>non fillers</strong></em> duels won under her sleeve, a rival for the main girl with <em><strong>more</strong></em> focus than her school duelist comrades, a mother who supports, inspires and duels sense into his son, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a> for the main girl who develops a bond with her and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> defects the enemy's side</span> because of it, <em><strong>and</strong></em> there seems to be another two girls with promising potential as well, even better while their duels did start up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight">Designated Girl Fight</a> on play, even this has been averted from some time now, with them dueling mostly other male characters as well, <em><strong>and</strong></em> winning. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately, this fell short in the later arcs as all the girls were quickly set aside due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsofCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsofCharacters">a lot of new characters introduced every episode</a>. Then they all turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> for nearly the latter half. Rin and Ruri were quickly cast aside after all the hype they got, much to the fanbase's anger.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean</a></em>: The protagonist and two of her closest allies are female (and <em>tough</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">even by JoJo standards</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. Although the two most important characters in the show are male, there are female heroes that manage to be just as cool and competent as them, or even moreso. There are also females in every major group and organization in the story (Ashford Academy; the Brittanian royal family, the Britanian army, the Black Knights, three of the story's four engineers, etc.) whom everyone accepts and who seem to be equal to their male counterparts in plot importance and what they do, or sometimes even better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> has a 2:2 ratio between male and female main characters for most of its run, though it varies from arc to arc. In every version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>—the novels, manga, TV series, movies, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation">OVAs</a>—the protagonist is an extraordinarily powerful young woman. No one seems to think it odd for a woman to have adventures within the setting, either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> has both males and females working with NERV and the other organizations. There are also both male and female Eva pilots, and Shinji's mother was a great scientist. Likewise, each and every character, regardless of gender, had plenty of personal issues in their lives which showed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">how screwed up they are</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> fits here, tentatively. There are many more male characters than females, but the female characters you do see in the various ensembles (especially Yoko and Nia, and Adiane on the villains' side) are perfectly independent and capable—with a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">Faux Action Girl</a> exceptions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> has a pretty well-rounded cast of both male and female. The female characters (both meisters and weapons) are just as capable as their male counterparts on the battlefield. All the main characters have had their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>, despite being a gangster anime set primarily in the 1930s, actually seems to treat its female characters very well—female characters are allowed in roles about as diverse as the male characters, and some are very capable fighters, who can and do stand up to the men.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> ensures a fairly stable gender equality ratio, as men and women are frequently shown to be equally competent in terms of tactical and physical fighting skill. For every badass State Alchemist like Roy Mustang, there's an equally skilled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> like Riza Hawkeye.
<ul><li> Making it more complex: out of the whole cast in which 20+ alchemists are seen there are a grand total of two female alchemists and neither of them are State Alchemists. That said, they're not state alchemists because they don't want to be; they would be eagerly welcomed if they chose to join the military and one of them is, in fact, scouted by Bradly himself and turned him down.
</li><li> Still more so: Izumi Curtis will, loud and proud, declare herself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseWife">House Wife</a> while beating the fuck out of a Homunculus to save her student, the male protagonist.
</li></ul></li><li> The vast majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s works treat female characters as equal to their male counterparts, if not superior in one way or another. This is quite intentional on the part of Miyazaki, an avowed feminist. To Miyazaki's credit, when there <em>is</em> any clear superiority of female over male (for example, it's heavily implied that only females can perform magic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></em>), it's never treated as a failing on anyone's part; that's just the way it is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> fits this category, having quite a lot of female pilots, most of which can fight just as well as any male. If any woman is defeated in combat, it's more than likely due to having a less than powerful mobile suit. For bonus points, one of the greatest themes of Zeta is the dissonant and controlling relationships between men and women. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">Paptimus Scirocco</a>, for example, manages to manipulate so many women that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">one actually defects from his opposition</a>. Examples of misogyny in the series cause in-universe reactions that range from outrage to the women actually turning it around on the men. Summarized aptly by Reccoa Londe:
<div class="indent"><em>"Men are perhaps born to fight each other. And women are perhaps fated to be their tools."</em>
</div><ul><li> To make things more complex: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the aforementioned woman that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">defected to the Titans</a> was Reccoa, who did it either because Scirocco manipulated her or because she didn't want to be a tool for men, even though that is essentially what she became when she turned over to the Titans. Emma calls her out on this, as she herself defected from her original faction <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">for better reasons</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>, also directed by Tomino, fits into this category as well. Women are shown to be equals with men in politics, military competence and society in general. This is more true to the advanced Moonrace, where they seemed to have taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject">Gender Is No Object</a> to heart. Though even Earth, whose inhabitants consider the notion of a woman leading a country as a novelty at best, isn't that far behind despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast">19th Century/World War I</a> atmosphere.
</li><li> Though there are relatively fewer female characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, the ones that <em>do</em> show prominently generally fall into this. Hungary is shown to be just as competent as, if not even <em>manlier</em> than the males while others such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Liechtenstein</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">Belarus</a> are by <em>no</em> means submissive pushovers. There's also an overall even-handedness to how gender is treated, even on the side of the males (case in point: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink">Finland</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Poland</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Austria</a>). The same is true for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleSixtyThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleSixtyThree">Nyotalia</a> version of the characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>: While the editorial department is entirely male, the female manga writers are not presented as inferior to their male counterparts, and are able to establish series in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a></em> and keep them running. While Mashiro and Takagi are once admonished for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">trying to take ideas from (mostly female) fan mail</a>, it's pointed out that this is because the female readers are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> that, however, wouldn't want a genre change. While Iwase is sometimes thought of as petty in-universe and among the fanbase for pursuing manga as an extension of her rivalry with Takagi, Takagi is ultimately forced to acknowledge her skill, particularly when his and Mashiro's manga <em>Tanto</em> gets outperformed by her and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Nizuma's</a> <em>+Natural</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> actually has a one-to-one gender parity among the principal cast; even the women who aren't pilots are still important to the plot, and in fact it could easily be argued that female lead Relena is more critical to the story than male lead Heero. One character does come off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeManWomanHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeManWomanHater">He-Man Woman Hater</a>, but it's due to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>, and he eventually gets over this attitude.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>. Even with the main characters for most generations having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGuysAndAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGuysAndAGirl">Two Guys and a Girl</a> ratio, the girls are shown to be just as well-developed and strong as the guys and the secondary cast also has a healthy amount of females in various roles. Yellow, Crystal, and Platinum, all girls, even get to star in their own arcs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> fits into this category, more or less. If a girl isn't a bonefied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">there is only one true action girl in the series</a>) then she is at least competent enough to not to have to depend on a guy to save her each and every time; that, and every major female character, no matter her physical strength, has contributed something to the plot or arc.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shiki">Shiki</a></em> is a rather complex case. On the one hand, the characters clearly live in a patriarchal society, given that it's a traditionalist rural village in Japan. On the other, individual examples of powerful women abound, both among the humans and vampires (and on the flip side, there's a fair amount of ineffectual men), although it is true that the <em>most</em> powerful female character is also probably the closest thing the show has to a central antagonist. Furthermore, both males and females participate in the climactic battle at the end, seemingly with no real discrepancies in gender roles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a>.</em> There are plenty of male and female characters of very diverse roles and levels of relevance.

The various Red and Mauve Shirts are also of very assorted gender, but this doesn't stop them from having equally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel And Unusual Deaths</a> at the hands of the titans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HollowFields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HollowFields">Hollow Fields</a></em>, being written for all demographics, takes special care in regarding both genders with equal capability and importance. There are more women than men in the setting, with the protagonist being a female, but this doesn't stop the male characters from playing crucial roles in the story. Almost everyone is capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">mad science</a>, and the sole exception is an artificial creation designed solely for watchkeeping (and has an ambiguous gender).

In fact two of the four Hogwarts founders were women. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, magic is an equalizer for factors that normally kept women down in society and since the global Wizarding World is so small and beholden to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>, they dont really have the option of being choosy about who is or isnt allowed to hold a high place in society. Most of the important characters are still men, although there are several strong and <em>very</em> important female characters (and two villains we love to hate-Dolores Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange). The fifth book in particular added several prominent female characters that are fan favorites, including Luna Lovegood, Tonks (who was also the first female Auror identified on page), and the aforementioned female villains. The two people outside of Harry who are most directly involved with both the downfalls of Voldemort are women as well. His mother, Lily, sacrificed herself for him which caused him to die the first go around and Narcissa Malfoy later lied to his face, knowing it would kill him, to save Draco.

Not to mention that there has never been a point in the series where there were no female leaders, all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girls</a> throughout the series, and how later deputies have been female. The only difference between toms and she-cats is that she-cats have to nurse their kits for six months, which is more a biological necessity than discrimination. On top of that, there has been an almost equal number of male and female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a>. The only real question that has come up on occasion is whether or not female cats in positions of authority should be allowed to have kits. There's no explicit rule against it, but it is not often done because it is believed that having kits will distract and incapacitate the she-cat, especially while nursing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leafstar challenges this idea in <em>SkyClan's Destiny</em>, citing the warrior code rule "The word of the Clan leader is the warrior code" as the reason: she's the leader, so she gets to say what's okay and not, and she says that it's okay for female leaders to have kits.</span> There's still a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">controversy</a> among the fans as to whether there's sexism in the series, though, with the 15:4 ratio of male to female leaders from the prequel super editions to the present often cited, or the way that the series tends to follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent">Females Are More Innocent</a>, with one female villain <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> involved being dumped by a tom</span> and another minor one who got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> to <em>many</em> male villains.

The Star Kingdom of Manticore, the (People's) Republic of Haven, and most other Honorverse societies are more or less perfectly gender-equal; even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marines</a> have many female members

As a result, the balance of power is shifted way over towards the female side, and many women are convinced of their inherent superiority (in fact, most men are inherently stronger in magic as well as physicality.) So, as noted, it arrives here not because of gender parity, but because both sexes are equally sexist. Two Wrongs Make A Balance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMillenniumTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMillenniumTrilogy">The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</a></em> depicts a lot of evil men, but Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist share time as the focus character and are both skilled.
</li><li> Megan Whalen Turners <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQueensThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQueensThief">The Queen's Thief</a></em> books are pretty even on gender equality. While the majority of the major cast is male in terms of numbers, Eddis and Attolia are both female and hands-down two of the wicked smartest characters in the series. Gen is arguably smarter than them, but he needed both of their smarts to accomplish most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitIndex">his crazy gambits</a>. Even stupidity (when it shows up, which isnt often) is distributed pretty well proportionally between male and female characters (for example: Nahuseresh and Costis, for males, and Hanaktos daughter for females). Even the important deities are evenly split between male and female, as with Moira and Eugenides. Irrespective of gender, most of the main characters in this series are pretty freakin <em>badass</em>. This is especially impressive considering the setting is based on ancient-to-medieval Greece, and even the culture within the books isnt incredibly egalitarian. The characters are defying their own universe to be gender-equal.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series is here in regards to the characters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">philosophy</a>, though most of the societies are heavily unequal in one way or another. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">House and Rahl and the Imperial Order</a> are ruled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist">straw misogynists</a>, where women are considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">breeding stock</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomenAreSafeWithUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomenAreSafeWithUs">worse</a>. The Midlands is an odd example: It's a patriarchal society where women wear their hair cut short as a sign of submission to men, but the ruling Confessors wear their hair long as a sign of defiance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">kill all of their male children at birth</a> because they don't think men have the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">unique compassion of a woman</a>" to resist abusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">their powers</a>, thereby placing them at either the far end of female domination or a kind of isolated Full Gender Separation within a non-separated society. Westland is probably the most equal, with women able to rise to the highest positions (councilors), laws in place to protect women and harshly punish rapists, and none of the obvious social restrictions that women in the Midlands live under.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> falls squarely here for the entire run of the series.

</li><li> For the most part, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gone">Gone</a></em> falls into this category. It got some accusations of a Level 4 early on, but the later books fixed it, putting it here.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em> features an unusual cross between this category and Full Gender Separation. In human society, there are very strict rules on which things men can and cannot do, and equally strict rules for women. For example, women are not allowed to be soldiers or know how to fight, but men are forbidden from learning to read or write. Both genders occupy roles absolutely essential for the function of any society and have equal importance in the plot.

Each and every story has both boys and girls embarking on important fantasy adventures together, and they all actively contribute on a fairly equal level. The main imbalance is that the girls are usually kept away from battle situations, but modern adaptations tend to fix that and there's no reason to believe that the actual Narnians don't have women fighting in their ranks. In fact, the movies blatantly show female Narnians in battle, such as a whole unit of female centaurs acting as the archers in <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> film. There's also no shortage of powerful female villains in addition to male ones.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a></em> has both men and women serving in the military in all kinds of positions, including leading armies, and for most of the story, the Malazan Empire is ruled by an Empress who made her way to the throne through skills and cunning. And even in more gender-segregated societies like that of the Tiste Edur, who have no warrior women while men are almost exclusively warriors and have more political clout, the women on the other hand have a lot more say-so in other areas starting from familial matters and going to matters of sorcery, with only the Warlock King having more sorcerous clout than the matriarchs of the noble families (even though both genders seem to be equally likely to have magical affinities). In fact, those families have both matriarchs and patriarchs. Gender equality through most—and possibly even all—cultures in the setting is, per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/2vnkyp/rfantasy_exclusive_authorial_intent_discussion/">intentional<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Men and women participate essentially equally in both government and the military (the President is a woman for most of the series, and the head of the Fleet is a man, but the Quorum of Twelve is mixed and there are high-ranking officers of both sexes).
<ul><li> In some cases, they're even more open-minded than modern society. For instance, public restrooms, at least on Galactica, are unisex. Also, in one episode Sam mentions to Apollo that Kara proposed marriage to him, and there is no indication that a woman proposing to a man is unusual in their society.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> hovers between this and Type 4.

Sometimes various series can be a borderline example, especially due to the lead character inevitably being male. However, the lead females of the franchise still fight on the front alongside their male counterparts, still will save others as well as be saved, and sometimes are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">more level headed</a> or more intelligent by comparison. And while it's more on the lower end of this part of the scale, it's still very near equality. It should be noted that males always outnumber females on ranger teams and women are rarely the focus character of the season. This can be attributed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sentai">Sentai</a> footage where the red ranger is usually treated as the series main character.

Kate Beckett does tend to have the edge over Richard Castle as both a detective and an action hero, although this can be explained both by her being more driven and focused personality-wise than his more flippant and irreverent nature and by her being a trained professional detective as opposed to him being an untrained mystery writer.

For one Snow White and Prince Charming are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a>, their daughter and grandson are prominent players, and the supporting cast is made up of a near equal group of males and females.

And while villains do get redeemed, the show avoids the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">High-HeelFace Turn</a>. Out of all villains, half of the males have been redeemed and at least two females (Tamara and Cruella) are irredeemably evil.

Some of the cases that they handle are sex-related and several of the victims are women. The show deconstructs these sort of cases where the FBI take them very seriously. However, in the middle of the show, J.J. and Emily were out of the show due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> leaving Garcia as the only female member of the team, much of the fans' frustrations.

It naturally has a lot more female characters but there are still plenty of male characters in the prison staff and families of the inmates.

It can differ according to the setting, with allowances for the fact that it's mostly medieval-level societies. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> are probably the most egalitarian, with plenty of powerful, competent women who hold the same roles men do.
<ul><li> D&amp;D has an interesting relationship with this trope. As explained in the v3.5 <em>Dungeon Master's Guide II</em>, the makers of the game have gone out of their way to ensure gender equality, both mechanically and within the (generally assumed) game universe—even when this clashes with players' initial expectations of a medieval-ish society. There is a simple and compelling reason for this: they don't want barriers for female player characters. However, since D&amp;D is possibly the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> of the fantasy genre, a lot of other fantasy works that didn't have the same practical need for egalitarianism picked it up anyway. The result is that today, completely gender-blind fantasy worlds are the norm unless this trope is actually discussed in the work. This applies even if the world is otherwise based on a medieval or otherwise non-gender-equal real-world culture.

</li><li> Applies to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em> campaign setting, since the dangers of the west means most communities need everyone they can get and can't be picky.

The game has a male <em>and</em> female protagonist in the form of twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye who run a street gang called the Rooks, which is going up against the Templar-controlled Blighters to reclaim London for the Assassin Brotherhood. Notably, both the Rooks and Blighters, as well as the more elite Templars, are composed of male and female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, averting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender">Men Are the Expendable Gender</a> trope by presenting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Would Hit a Girl</a> trope in a feminist context.
<ul><li> There is a controversial split over Evie's handling, namely in that she's playable for roughly 25% of the story missions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFavoredGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFavoredGender">compared to Jacob's 75%</a>. This is mitigated somewhat by the fact that Evie is available for literally everything else in the game. Free roam, income activities, and the vast majority of side quests can be completed by both Jacob and Evie. There is also the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jacob's actions are presented as being hasty and shortsighted, and ultimately have negative effects on London that Evie must help fix, and that it is ultimately her quest for the Shroud that finishes off the game and becomes the more important storyline</span>.
</li><li> There also turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a second female protagonist for a brief portion of the game that jumps to World War I named Lydie Frye, Jacob's grand-daughter and the active Assassin in London in 1916, thereby making it out to be that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> trio in the game is composed of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGirlsAndAGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGirlsAndAGuy">Two Girls and a Guy</a></span>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> fits right in here. The main protagonist is male more often than not, but there are quite a few women who share that role with a male lead. (Although there has yet to be a female lord who is unquestionably <em>the</em> protagonist without sharing that role with someone else, but it's not a huge loss.) Story-wise, there are as many females in positions of power as males, and functionally, the genders are equal in combat. For every uber-powered male character you run into, there's an uber-powered female somewhere (e.g., Ike and Hector are regarded as powerhouses, but so are Ayra and Titania).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> zig-zags this depending on the specifics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, it seems that most of Thedas is pretty gender-neutral, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfUniverse">Out-of-Universe</a>, some stereotypes still apply.
<ul><li> Overall, it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting">Standard Fantasy Setting</a> where women can become warriors (from common soldiers to knights to religious templars), scholars, heads of noble houses and lands, and heads of state with no in-universe detraction. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">Women Are Wiser</a> is in assumption for the Chantry, which is a gender-reversal of the restrictions of the Catholic Church, due to the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Crystal Dragon Jesus</a> herself being female. In Tevinter, their version of the Chantry has an all-male priesthood but is otherwise apparently as egalitarian as the rest of Thedas.
</li><li> That being said, almost every female character in a position of power got there either as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingTheirWayToTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingTheirWayToTheTop">Sleeping Their Way to the Top</a> or some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>. For instance, the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Crystal Dragon Jesus</a> was the wife of a king who later became the chosen bride of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaker">The Maker</a>, the story's YHWH <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>. Likewise, Queen Anora of Ferelden married the legitimate heir, King Maric, to become queen consort. Empress Celene of Orlais (by de facto, the most politically-powerful woman outside of the Chantry) had to make friends and political allies to outmaneuver her cousin (a man) in the legitimate line of succession. It's also implied that she has, or will, perform sexual favors or employ seduction as necessary to secure her power. While each of these women quickly proved that they were ruthless and/or competent enough that the position was well deserved, for the most part, they still got there in a way that's stereotypically feminine.
</li><li> Dwarves have a tradition of female warriors who fight for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Silent Sisters</a>, and women are forced to become warriors, smiths, or merchants just like the men depending on what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">caste</a> they were born into. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingTheirWayToTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingTheirWayToTheTop">Sleeping Their Way to the Top</a> still applies, as we're specifically told about a subsect of Common Dwarves called "Noble Hunters", whose main goal is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap">have a child with a noble</a> so that they and their child can be ascended into a better life. Noble hunters can be male, but the <em>vast</em> majority are female, and the player themselves can only have a sexual encounter with them if male.
</li><li> Elves in human lands are universally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">treated like shit</a> by the humans and disenfranchised as a whole, although it would appear elven women in particular face the threat of being raped by human men who have been given license to abuse them. Dalish elves are egalitarian, with female hunters and warriors being just as common as their male counterparts. The individual leader of every Dalish clan, called the Keeper, can also be male or female. However, we're only given one glimpse at how a Dalish courtship works, and that instance involves a male hunter needing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller">go out and kill something to bring back as an engagement gift</a>. Whether this would also apply if genders were reversed is unknown.
</li><li> The aforementioned Qunari have rather strict gender roles, but enforce them just as harshly on their men as well as their women. The Qunari do not view women or men as being weaker compared to the other, merely different and destined to fulfill different duties in their fiercely collectivist society. Ironically, this makes the Qunari a de facto matriarchal society since the higher administrative and political positions are occupied entirely by women, according to their custom. Individuals who transgress these gender roles aren't punished or pitied, but rather declared transgender and allowed to assume the role, and gender identity, of whatever it is they're best at.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> world it's pretty common to see women as soldiers, carrying weapons (and knowing well how to use them), in charge of units and fighting like their male counterparts, you can even see female raiders and bandits, and female <em>ghouls</em>. Looks like that, when you live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> full of mutant animals, merciless criminal gangs, radiation, enormous and scary super mutants and extremely deadly creatures like the deathclaws, sexism is a stupid and pointless thing and every human able to use a weapon must do the work.
<ul><li> Though there are only a few female Enclave soldiers (besides, they look the same as men due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, making it hard to tell them apart). Most of them are given seemingly safer jobs as scientists and leaving the dangerous wasteland duties to the men. Most likely because of their wish to preserve the human species.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> does have as one of its main factions Caesar's Legion, who are quite enthusiastic about wanting to push back the setting to Roman levels of sexual discrimination... But then, they're kinda bad guys, so it's not really surprising.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> falls here with not only the main playable cast being 3 out of 5 females, all 3 are figures of authority and just as capable as the male cast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> has a debate going over which female party member is the main character, said two female characters are the only ones who learn magic naturally, one of them used to be a general, and the plot focuses just as much on the female characters as the male ones in total... due to there being that many more male characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> uses the same trick as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>, not in both genders being stupid, but with giving the females the cool magic powers. Other than that, the various roles are split very well among the cast, with both genders shown to be equally emotionally weak. This is also the first game in the series where the main playable party is split 50/50 between the genders (disregarding temporary party members), a tradition that's been (mostly) carried on since.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> hands super powers of mass destruction and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSODs</a> to both genders equally (if you take Kuja into the consideration, if not then the girls win on the superpowerful magic side of things). There are several competent females in positions of power (including badass army general Beatrix), and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">amazon army</a> for Alexandria. The main party of heroes has Garnet, Freya, and Eiko; three strong, fleshed-out, and highly competent ladies.
</li><li> While the universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> may be less equalized, the story itself is definitively gender-balanced. With the focus of the story being on Yuna's journey instead of Tidus's achievements, and the only insignificant party member being a male one (Kimahri). And the stretch through the ruins of Zanarkand shows that the setting's past has been strewn with strong female figures just as much as males.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> gender-balances well with princess Ashe being more recognized as the main character than viewpoint character Vaan (though Basch was originally designed as the main character, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">it was decided that the game's demographic wouldn't go for a middle-aged male lead</a>). The focal point of the story is not centered so much on the characters as it is on the political climate of Ivalice as a result of the Archadian Empire's control over Ashe's rightful territory of Dalmasca (and, in the background, their struggle with the neighbouring Rozzarian Empire). The only real gender issue that is ever brought up within the game is the segregation between male and female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan">Viera</a> (of which only the females are even seen in-game); outside of this, gender roles appear to be more or less balanced. With that said, Judge Drace, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">the sole woman</a> within the ranks of the Archadian Judge Magisters, was the only one to directly call out Vayne for killing his father, Emperor Gramis, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLBGbUGryRE">was executed for it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The fact that she was the only major female character outside of the protagonist's team in the game doesn't really help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> continues on the by now-tradition of having just as many well-fleshed out female characters as male characters. It's the second in the series with a female main character and gives the females both of the more iconic recurring summons (Bahamut and Odin). The males, as a balance, get the cooler Synthesist roles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has an interesting case. Aside from the obvious situation of lacking statistical differences between the genders, all three nations are led by women, and the main contact for the second half of the story in A Realm Reborn is female as well (making roughly half of the active members of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn female, if you count Tataru; if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> is female that balance is tilted). In addition, A Realm Reborn adds playable male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan">Miq'ote</a> and female Rogaedyn, maintaining the balance of playable genders. (Although <em>Shadowbringers</em> would later tilt this again with the lithe, buxom and bunny-like Viera and the hulking, stout and felinid Wrothgar being exclusively female and male, respectively.) However, while Kan-E-Senna of Gridania and Admiral Bloefyswyn of Limsa Lominsan are strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> leaders of their nations, Sultana Nanamo of Ul'dah is a tiny Lalafell and unsuited to fighting, so the Ul'dah contact is her hulking general, Raubahn (he is often seen <em>carrying</em> her). Additionally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after defeating Titan, Minfilia, and half of the Scions (including plenty of the men, mind) are kidnapped. Fortunately the two "active" women, Yda and Y'shtola, escape and help you coordinate the rescue, but it still is a little rocky</span>. On the plus side? NPC dialogue will actually change to reflect your character's gender when speaking about you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MOTHER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MOTHER">Mother</a></em> (also known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthbound">Earthbound</a></em>) is a series that focuses on a male protagonist throughout all three games, but does tend to feature females as being fairly integral to the story throughout the series. Gameplay-wise, the female playables all suffer from being cast as relatively frail physically, though Mother 1 has a Pippi-Longstocking shoutout who joins early and is the strongest character in the game growthwise (same stat growth as Teddy, the game's physical powerhouse), and though Ana is technically optional, she gets a myriad of insanely strong offensive, defensive, and support PSI, and is arguably the most potent PSI user in the entire series; she can do nearly anything with her PSI. Mother 2/Earthbound is perhaps the worst offender of the series, with Paula being kidnapped repeatedly, despite her being the first playable character with some extremely potent offensive PSI at her disposal, and the one who is integral in bringing together all the other characters as well as the one character needed during the final battle thanks to her special ability. Mother 3 is by far the best in terms of gender equality portrayal, including dealing with androgyny and transgenderism in a positive light.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaRPG">SaGa</a></em> features relatively equal amounts of male and female characters throughout the games. The early ones had marginally different starting stats and equipment depending on if you chose male or female characters (with females actually being advantageous in several cases such as getting a Saber in the first game if you started female), but gender had no effect whatsoever on your stat growth or what skills/equipment you could use.

The Jedi Grandmaster Satale Shan is female and so was her predecessor. By end game, the Republic's Supreme Chancellor is a female Twi'lek. The Sith Empire drafts any non-Force user of age into the Imperial Military for both combat and non-combat roles. Also the Sith more concerned with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> to non-humans and non-sith purebloods than gender inequality.

</li><li> Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> is usually very good at gender equality in playable characters, the only games with a female protagonist are the games where you can choose between male or female. Even then, promotional art usually features the male character more often. There is also not many female villains in the series, either.
<ul><li> Starting from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em>, female characters are much more prominent. All of the playable characters can be male or female.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI">Dragon Quest XI</a></em> is definitely here. Although the main character is still a man, three out of the seven <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until Act 2, when another guy joins</span> party members are strong and powerful women; especially Jade, who's basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">girl power incarnate</a>. Among the supporting characters, there's a good balance between men and women, and the player sees plenty of female fighters at the coliseum. Add to that a handful of female villains, and this game does pretty well. There's even some positive LGBT representation in Sylvando; while the game never <em>states</em> that he's gay, it's quite clear that he's intended to be written as such.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceGame">otome games</a> have plot driven mainly by men with minimally written female characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfPrettyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfPrettyBoys">since that's what most people play them for</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CodeRealize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CodeRealize">Code:Realize</a></em> stands out for having a protagonist with agency in the story and having characterization and backstory just as rich as the male love interests. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">She can hold her own in a battle, too.</a> There are many other women that play major roles in the story, all of them well-written and badass to some degree.

There's also a good number of female villains. Perhaps the only imbalance was the lack of female protagonists, which has now been remedied with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Tales of Berseria</a></em>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> does this intentionally. In the beginning, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Lloyd's personality</a> is balanced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Collette's</a>. We have Raine and Kratos, both portrayed as sensible and intelligent, and when Sheena joins up, she and Genis are considerably more idealistic than Raine and Kratos, but also considerably more pragmatic than Lloyd and Collette. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kratos leaves</span>, his place is eventually taken by the equally respectable Regal. Overall, people of both genders are represented with a wide range of personalities, viewpoints, and intelligence/skill levels. In addition, the game's world seems quite egalitarian, with a healthy supporting cast of important male and female NPCs, a powerful and prominent female villain (Pronyma), and several women among the enemy organizations' ranks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia">Tales of Xillia</a></em>: Either the male or female lead can fill the role of "protagonist," while both are extremely capable, as are their companions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em> sits particularly firmly here with extremely badass heroes and villains both male (Luke, Jade, Guy, Van, Asch, Largo, Sync) and female (Tear, Natalia, Anise, Legretta, Arietta) alike, and said males and females sharing equal prominence in the story. In fact, the leading lady Tear's introduction consists of her infiltrating a mansion and performing an assassination attempt on someone <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who later is revealed to be the main villain</span>. Mind you, she's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a> and also a soldier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Tales of Berseria</a></em> is the first Tales games in which the protagonist is female, and sure enough, she's a massive badass who carries the story exceptionally well, with a great deal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> to boot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> is another good example. The main party consists of four guys, four girls, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">dog</a>. All four girls are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girls</a>, and the whole party has a wide range of different personality types, which are all treated as equally valid and respectable. They're also all extremely competent in their own way, with Yuri and Judith being the biggest badasses. There's also shown to be several women among the knights, guilds, and political positions. Perhaps the only notable imbalance is the lack of major female villains, but even that's softened a little by fighting plenty of female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> as well as male ones.
</li></ul></li><li> The first few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports">Backyard Sports</a></em> games are an extreme example of this trope. The playable characters are equally divided between boys and girls, and the commentators are a boy and a girl as well. What makes this extreme is that <em>all the NPCs</em> are equally divided between boys and girls.
</li><li> Post-Adventure <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> games rank here, as the women and men are pretty much equal, with minimal stereotyping sans designs. Unleashed onwards, however, slide the scale back to There Are No Women, as Amy and Cream are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> and Blaze and Rouge are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>.
</li><li> Most every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> game is split <em>very</em> cleanly down the middle. There's almost always a male and female protagonist each game partnering up and aside from a few slight gameplay differences (like Jill having a larger inventory in the original game), neither is really presented as better or worse than the others.
</li><li> It doesn't get much more egalitarian than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>. Not only are the hero and heroine both well-rounded and competent characters (as well as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan">relationship goals</a>), but there is a 50/50 split between men and women in the military whom you can recruit into your squad. In fact, a lot of the best soldiers in your roster are women, along with plenty of great male soldiers. The main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is a man, while his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">most important - and most ''dangerous'' - subordinate</a> is an absurdly powerful woman. Said female villain also gets her own DLC, in which you can play as her for 4 separate missions and learn more about her character. And yes, she gets to be insanely awesome in it. So yeah, this game has absolutely no shortage of strong women or men whatsoever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em> has an unusually even male-to-female ratio for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a> series, and both genders are roughly equally represented in terms of both screen time and power scale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em> has the exact same skill trees for both male and female soldiers, with both genders fighting on the front lines on equal footing, both having the same chances of developing psychic potential, and both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eligible to become the Volunteer</span>. Meanwhile at the base, (female) Dr. Vahlen and (male) Dr. Shen are your chief researcher and chief engineer, establishing gender equality in non-combat aspects of XCOM, as well.
</li><li> As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, Azeroth sports almost full equality. You will find an equal of male and female characters in almost every army. Three and 1/3 of the player faction leaders are female, and amongst the military commanders and minor faction leaders, while females are not as common as men, they are just as competent, noble, bloodthirsty, and evil, and there is extremely little dialogue that indicates the NPCs don't view them as equals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon">The Legend of Dragoon</a></em> fits here tentatively. While the official "female lead" Shana is definitely the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>, we also have Rose and Meru, two highly competent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girls</a> with every bit as much plot importance as the male characters (Rose is almost as much the leading lady as Shana). Later on, we meet Miranda, who's the general of an army. There's also a rather powerful female villain, Lenus. However, most of the equipment is notably gender-specific, Rose's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> status is sometimes treated as somewhat out of the ordinary, Lenus is the only prominent female villain, and a good many of the important NPCs are male. However, there are still a decent share of important female NPCs and three of the seven legendary heroes are female, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and one of them is none other than Rose, one of the leading ladies</span>. Overall, while there are a couple of factors holding it back a little, it is certainly not enough to situate the game in Level 4, placing it quite comfortably here.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>, the only requirement to be a playable character is to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">Badass</a>, so any female champion is automatically an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>. While the number of male characters <em>is</em> greater than the number of female characters, female champions are fairly represented in all positions and roles, and appear throughout the tier lists, just as male characters do. In the lore, there are just as many women in positions of power as there are men, especially in Ionia, the Freljord, and Piltover.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">sequel</a> featured more female Jedi and Sith than the <em>Star Wars</em> movies themselves. One of them (Bastila Shan) ended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> but she kicked ass when she got out and is well known by the Jedi for her Battle Meditation which boosts the morale of her side through the Force.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa">Danganronpa</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualEnsemble">Gender-Equal Ensemble</a> in every main game and, counting the novels, the amount of main characters male and female is roughly equal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> from a gameplay perspective has almost as many female badasses as males. In the story, which is told in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedUniverse">Extended Universe</a>, they're just as central to the plot as their male counterparts, whether they be on the side of good (Tracer, Mercy), evil (Widowmaker, Sombra), are morally ambiguous (Symmetra), or are a core part of the backstory (Ana). There's no implication that gender holds someone back at all in this universe, with the good guys accepting of both genders and even the villains being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EqualOpportunityEvil">Equal-Opportunity Evil</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KisekiSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KisekiSeries">Kiseki Series</a></em> that only recently started to become known in the west, while being very popular in Japan for the complex story, is full of this. For starters, you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">female protagonist right in the first arc</a> and the whole female cast is as competent as the male cast. This does <strong>not</strong> change in the following arcs, where every female character has the same amount of development as the men, are equally as skilled, and win fights that are plot-relevant. It got to the point that we have women in the ranks of the strongest characters in the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">main antagonist of the franchise included!</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>: Inklings and Octolings of both genders can participate in Turf Wars and ranked battles. Agents 3, 4, and 8 can be male or female and kick just as much ass regardless. Callie, Marie, Pearl, and Marina are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singers</a> by day, but double as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girls</a> when the going gets tough. The two most prominent male characters, Cap'n Cuttlefish and DJ Octavio, are highly competent strategists and military commanders (as dotty as the former seems initially). All in all, the series favors women slightly more than men but does a very good job of portraying the two as equals.

</p><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, there are a lot of well-characterized female characters that are independent of a relationship with a male (Princess Bubblegum, Marceline, Lumpy Space Princess). Both genders are also very capable of kicking ass and defending themselves as well.
<ul><li> The same principle also applies to its genderbent world of Aaa: Fionna, Cake, and Ice Queen are pretty much introduced as independent female characters who are as competent as their male counterparts, just as how Marshall and Gumball are as competent as their female counterparts.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>, male and female characters are generally portrayed at about the same level of (in)competence. Everyone is screwed up emotionally or mentally, with no overt correlation between level of competence or emotional state and gender.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, the genders are represented fairly equally.
<ul><li> To break down the main group, in the first season and part of the second, there was Aang (male/bender), Katara (female/bender), and Sokka (male/normal). In the second season they pick up Toph (female bender) and the group stays as that until the third season. Then, halfway through that season, finally finishing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, Zuko (male/bender) joins and several episodes later helps bring in Suki (female/normal). That brings it to an even representation in overall numbers and combat abilities for both sexes.
<ul><li> Azula and her all-girl team of antagonists are far more successful in general than the previous male antagonists (succeeding in their conquest of the Earth Kingdom where Zhao failed at the North Pole, and striking down the Avatar himself after Zuko failed so many times).
</li></ul></li><li> It's also a bit odd to note that the villainous Fire Nation seemed to have a more gender-equal military (or at least police) than the good guy Earth Kingdom (we only ever saw male Earth Kingdom soldiers or police/city-guards, while the Fire Nation even had mixed-gender prisons and prison guards). The Water Tribes turned out to be even more sexist; Sokka was something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeManWomanHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeManWomanHater">He-Man Woman Hater</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">at first</a>, and the waterbenders at the North Pole turned out to be a bunch of jerks—much to Katara's chagrin. This resulted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackieRobinsonStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackieRobinsonStory">Jackie Robinson Story</a>, which ultimately worked out for Katara.Theres also the fact that come the time of <em>Korra </em>, Zukos daughter is the Firelord and its not treated like a big deal and shes a calm, capable head of state.
</li><li> Of the six Avatars we know of (Korra, Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, and Yangchen), there's a perfectly even three to three gender balance. The shot of all the Avatars in <em>Korra </em> is roughly split equally between men and women.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> brings us a close-up on one of those female Avatars, series lead Korra. Her main crew are two male benders, and her Airbender master is male as well. However, joining the female members are Pema, Ikki, Jinora and especially, Chief Bei Fonga kickass earth bender who doesn't take crap from anybody, and Asami Sato, a rich girl who is perfectly capable of kicking asses without a bending ability. The bad guys, on the other hand, skew pretty heavily male, with the only female Equalists being background extras with no lines.
</li><li> The second season ups the ante a bit for both sides. The hero's side remains fairly egalitarian with the addition of Kya and Bumi, Tenzin's brother and sister, both of whom are very competent in their respective fields and get the opportunity to show it. Lin Beifong takes a back seat to keep the focus on Korra and her gang, but Jinora steps up into her place to take a significant role in the plot of the finale. The antagonists' side is still fairly male-centric, with Unalaq and Varrick being the equally villainous bosses on both sides of a civil war. However, their female sidekicks both take <em>much</em> more active roles in the story. Zhu Li, Varrick's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlFriday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlFriday">Girl Friday</a>, seems to be even more competent than Varrick at times; Eska, Unalaq's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain">daughter</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">dragon</a>, is the dominant personality of her and her brother Desna's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins">relationship</a> and not at all afraid of going against her father's orders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonWithAnAgenda">when she deems it necessary</a>.
</li><li> The third and fourth seasons make things about as equal as possibly imaginable between the genders. The third season features another male main villain (Zaheer), however two out of his three subordinates (all of whom are extremely badass) are female. It also introduces Suyin Bei Fong, the (very powerful) matriarch of a city of metalbenders. The fourth season finally introduces a female main villain (Kuvira) as well as the current Firelord (Izumi), not to mention reintroducing Toph. However, Kuriva's main (and very competent) subordinates tend to be male. All in all the series is a textbook of a show with many strong and competent characters of both genders.

Police detective Elisa Maza saves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Goliath's</a> life just as often as he saves hers, women being in positions of power (police chief, clan leader) is treated as a non-issue, and the female villains are just as interesting, well-motivated, and (on occasion) psychotic as their male counterparts.

At this level, women are always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a> and usually don't need men to fight for them. Men, while still competent (usually), are only supporters at best, accessories at worst, and can only hope to be part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance">Token Romance</a>. While cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverASelfMadeWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverASelfMadeWoman">Never a Self-Made Woman</a> can still happen, most times bloodlines, royal heritage and the like are matrilineal, and male power figures, if they exist, will always stay in the background or make just one demonstration of authority for good measure. While it's usually never stated that women are superior to men (that's more level 8), women are often shown as the only ones who can possibly make an impression in the storyline.

(There were male Claymores, but they were incapable of controlling themselves and ended up succumbing to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>.)
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> is commonly considered to belong here, since all of the male characters seem to be either evil or fairly ineffectual compared to Utena (or both). Then again, nobody in the show is without serious stains, and the gender dynamic is one of the points discussed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> fits here. The only reason that it isn't higher up is that men are clearly empowered to at least the same degree as they are in Real Life in-universe, but there are absolutely no men who are relevant to the plot, and the only ones portrayed at all are Akiyama's father, the Hana family's manservant, spectators, and the man from the Education Ministry.
</li><li> Male characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> are usually either characters who only show up in one episode, or one of the many easily-killable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>

</li><li> This trope is common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> series, most notably seen in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> anime, with Mamoru helping by just encouraging Usagi to never give up (and actually being more of a liability to the Sailor Senshi by being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">repeatedly brainwashed or kidnapped</a>), and three boys who help Sailor Senshi via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGenderBender">turning into magical girls themselves</a>.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">original manga</a>, the Sailor Starlights are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">simply cross-dressing</a> in an effort to find their princess faster. Mamoru also gets his own attack and crystal making him basically equal to the other Senshi (excluding Moon, who is on her own level) in the manga, though he's not recognized as a Senshi due to his gender.

Men are consistently shown to be either too incompetent and ineffectual, or self-important and arrogant, to figure out what is really going on in the eponymous world. Most of the females are little better; but the few that the novels actually focus on, particularly the protagonist, are far and away more competent and effective than the men.

Evil and crazy witches appeared several times, but women in the Buffyverse seemed to be <em>better</em> at magic—both in skill and ethical use. Dedicated male magicians seemed to be morally ambiguous at best. Compare Jonathan (or Andrew for that matter) to Willow and Tara. When facing Dark Willow in Season 6 Giles is explicitly empowered by a coven of <em>witches</em>. Female villains are guaranteed a pardon if they show the slightest amount of regret and are treated much more understandingly than men: the shortcut to showing that a villain is a monster is having him say "bitch", Buffy and Willow use the word "man" as an insult by the end of Season 7, the fact that Buffy reviles the shamans who created the slayer line despite the fact that they saved mankind many times over, that women in-universe are better than men at absolutely everything and of course—femininity equals good. In fact, the only <em>male</em> character who has shown any competency <em>and</em> remained good throughout the series was Giles.

Although it's not that females are explicitly <em>better</em> than males, it's that since the show's target audience is little girls, there were barely any male characters at all, and even when later seasons balanced out the cast with more recurring males it's still up to the females to do everything whether they like it or not. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, it's a type 5; on occasions when male characters do show up, it would appear that they're more or less on equal footing (hoofing?) with the females.

In the royal Butterfly family, only women can wield powerful magic, so the throne is always held by a long line of queens; the only exception was Jushtin the Uncalculated, who became the first male heir to the throne and the first male mage. But his mother, Queen Skywynne, was pressured into superseding his claim in favor of his younger sister and "rightful" heir, Solaria the Monster Carver. It is also implied in lore that men can only gain political power by marrying a Queen, and even then they're treated as glorified consorts whose only roles are to give the Queen a successor and make the Queen look good.

Meanwhile, male characters such as Lars, Greg, and Ronaldo are noticeably less skilled.

<p></p><h1>Can't Stand Men, Can't Live Without Them</h1>
Men are jerks and there's nothing good in living with them, because they only think about sex and how to get a partner under their thumbs. However, living without them is hard too—there are things that should not be the concern of women, or simply require brute strength to get accomplished. Also, there's one thing that makes males necessary—procreation. Simply, you need a man if you want to have kids, and if there's one thing they're good at, it's making kids.

The Hapan Consortium has been a matriarchy for centuries, to the point of having a female monarchy in the Queen Mother, whose son's wife will reign after, but not him. Their attitude is summed up in the saying: "Never let a man believe he is the intellectual equal of a woman. It only leads him to evil." The Witches of Dathomir, meanwhile, are a matriarchy of female Force users (women alone use the Force on this planet; they show surprise, upon meeting Luke Skywalker, that a man <em>can</em> use the Force, but this is because they weren't taught, as later books show Dathomiri men learning to use it). Men have the roles we associate with women, such as caring for their children, cooking, cleaning, etc., while being explicitly referred to and treated as slaves.

Meanwhile, women marry one another, raise children, and run every other aspect of society. By the end of the story, due to alien intervention, the sex ratio is becoming more equal and men's role is starting to be re-evaluated.

Although, since there is no (and never was a) male counterpart to the asari, it's argued that they are "genderless" (but just happen to fit all the traits of a human female). However, they are also stereotyped as the sex objects of the universe. Every species known is attracted to them, they are considered naturally beautiful and adept to sexual promiscuity, there are asari strippers everywhere, and many of the important asari characters show off skin or boobs.
