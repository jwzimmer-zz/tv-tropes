Perhaps they're spending too many hours at the office and not enough with the wife and kids, perhaps they've scheduled a business meeting at the same time as little Sally's birthday party or Tommy's athletics day, or perhaps their work is leading them into some very dark or dangerous situations. Either way, their spouse or partner isn't very happy with them, and is quick to let them know it.
</p><p>This trope is one of the key reasons why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyIsSingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyIsSingle">Everybody Is Single</a>, why many characters find it difficult to make a relationship last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">longer than a week</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">is one of the key causes of TV Divorce</a>. As such, it's a major source of angst and relationship tension. This trope usually comes in one of two forms.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><strong>The Character is a Workaholic</strong>. In some cases, this concern is justified — the character genuinely is spending too much time at work and is neglecting their other relationships and commitments, and the complaining spouse is genuinely in the right to call them out on it. This is particularly the case if the character has a career that, whilst it may be important, is not going to result in any fatalities or the Collapse of Western Civilization if they take a break now and then. In these cases, the character might be neglecting their significant others and relationships out of a genuine desire to provide the best for their families, having completely missed the point that it'd probably be better for their families in the long run if they actually spend some time with them now and again. On the other hand, they might just be too obsessed with their career and the perks, privileges and powers they have, and have forgotten what's important in life. Or because they're simply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">workaholic</a>. If it's a happy story, then the character will gradually realize that they're focusing on the wrong things and resolve to make amends and spend more time with their loved ones. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, the character will typically put in an insane amount of effort for a big promotion/raise/transfer/etc. at work, then actually get it, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">lose everyone who was important to them in the process</a> and quickly discover that whatever they wanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving">wasn't all it was cracked up to be</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><strong>The Character Performs a Job That is Just That Important</strong>. More often than not, the complaining spouse's position is a little less clear-cut and righteous. While they might have a good point about their loved one's spending too much time at work having a negative impact on their marriage/relationship, the fact is that their loved one does a job that <strong>is</strong> demanding and their partner really does need to put in all that time at work in order to effectively do their job. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, especially if the job is a profession that involves saving human lives, like a police officer, firefighter, paramedic, doctor, heart surgeon, and more, in which case people really <em>do</em> need to work long hours, be on call 24-7, and/or expose themselves to dangerous situations, and lives genuinely <em>can</em> be lost if they aren't attentive to their work to a high degree, even if this means they have to neglect their relationships or families. In these situations (whether the writer intended it or not), the complaining spouse may come across as selfish, whiny and unfairly demanding, especially if it should have been obvious from the start of the relationship that their loved one's job was going to demand a large portion of their time.
</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as a common complaint these days is that the pursuit of success in climbing the career ladder is causing more people to work longer hours with less time to spend with their loved ones.
</p><p>This is particularly common among military personnel, police detectives, secret agents and doctors. Architects also seem prone to this trope (and usually fall into the first category) for some reason.
</p><p>An interesting aspect whenever this is brought up in fiction is that nobody ever seems to direct the blame to the one thing largely responsible for this plight: mismanagement. If a character is spending too much time at their job, it usually means a mis-allocation of resources or manpower on a managerial level. Yet nobody ever approaches the supervisors and managers, even though they are the ones who might actually be able do something for the character suffering from this.

Mitsuhide even says he had never considered marriage until her position as a noble made it necessary for her to find a spouse and after thinking about it decided that he'll probably <em>never</em> get married as he wants no distractions from his job as Zen's knight and protector.</span> Kiki herself isn't very excited at the prospect of marriage and would probably prefer to remain a knight and aide but as the future head of an important noble house she can't.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em> he's so married to football that boy-and-girl relationships are the rarest element to be found around him; considering this a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shounen">Shounen</a> genre, it's not very strange. Subverted slightly when he confesses his love to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriousChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriousChildhoodFriend">Sanae</a>. Then he goes to Brazil and marries the job again, so that his girlfriend has to follow him there, love-struck and almost in tears before they finally get married for real.
</li><li> Lloyd Asplund from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a> who is wholly dedicated to the construction, maintenance, and development of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Z-01 Lancelot</a> to the point where he doesn't even acknowledge his fiancée-via-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> as a romantic interest. He certainly doesn't seem to be interested in love, and his carefree attitude suggests that it isn't by lack of time. He probably simply doesn't care.
</li><li> L from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. Because of his line of work, he is perpetually in danger and so doesn't get out very much. He also lacks charisma. Both of these factors mean that not only does L have no canon romantic relationships, but also no real friendships, either.
<ul><li> Soichiro in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathNote">the TV drama</a> is frequently away from home to his job. This puts a strain on his relationship with his son Light, who must act as a parental figure to Sayu, which is amplified by Soichiro's absence during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sachiko's death ten years prior.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Sousuke Sagara from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> is completely and totally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">socially inept</a> because of living his whole life as a soldier. One time, Kaname and Tessa hold a little bingo and concert party for soldiers to unwind, and Sousuke is shown very uncomfortable, showing disapproval of them relaxing on the job. It's only in <em>The Second Raid</em> that he even begins to consider the possibility of a life and a future with Kaname outside of the job — and that's only after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Mao</a> asks him about his plans for his future and then criticizes him sharply when his only answer is "follow orders."
<ul><li> His mentor Kalinin is implied to be as well. By reading between the lines of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">his nostalgia</a>, it is apparent his wife was rather unhappy about his sense of priorities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HatarakiMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HatarakiMan">Hataraki Man</a></em>: Hiroko dedicates almost all of her time to work, which causes the breakup between her and her boyfriend, who is also a workaholic.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KotetsuJeeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KotetsuJeeg">Kotetsu Jeeg</a></em>: Hiroshi Shiba did not know why his father was always working and barely talked to his family, and after several years, he decided he did not care about it or his father. When he learnt his reasons, he kind of forgave Prof. Shiba, but his mother still called her husband on it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LivingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LivingGame">Living Game</a></em> manga, Tokiko's husband spends all of his time at the office or away on business trips, leaving her to complain to the main characters. In fact, his devoted (male) assistant Komada is referred to at one point as a second 'wife'.
</li><li> Fate of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, whose job as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice">Enforcer</a> requires her to travel around space most of the time. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallMailSlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallMailSlot">Megami Sound Stages</a>, she laments the fact that she can't spend as much time as she wants with her adopted children Erio and Caro, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring">ViVid</a></em>, she was away so often that she was the <em>last</em> person to hear about her other adopted daughter Vivio's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAlterEgo">Adult Form</a> (Nanoha kinda forgot to mention that little detail to her).
<ul><li> The problem persists in the 2nd Mother's Day one-shot, when Vivio teases Fate about how often she is absent from her life (prompting Fate to angst that Vivio will no longer consider her one of her mothers), such as when she canceled a parental visit day for school due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice">her Enforcer duties</a> but still notes that she's her mother and dear to her.
</li><li> Subaru, in the Movie Sound stage, laments not being able to see her family very often due to her job in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyServices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyServices">rescue team</a> almost constantly having her on duty, but Teana reassures her that they're still her family, noting Fate as being close to her family in spite of where her job takes her.
</li><li> Fate's adoptive brother, Chrono, being an Admiral who commands a ship like his mother once did, is noted in the Sound Stages as being away from his children fairly often.
</li><li> Mostly averted however with Lindy. With her only son stationed on her ship, Work and Home are pretty much one and the same for her. Even so, she always tries to make time for Chrono (and later Fate after adopting her) as a mother as well as commander.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor">The Professor</a> Gennosuke Yumi spends most part of the time working in the Photonic Energy Research Laboratory or traveling to meet with other scientists. He is a widower, and his daughter Sayaka practically has to twist his arm to force him to go home and have supper. Although she never called him out on it, many times she felt neglected and regretted not only that she was motherless, but her father was too busy to be there for her when she needed him. It may be sort of justified since her Prof. Yumi was trying to save the world. Juzo Kabuto is another example: he hired a maid to take care of their grandsons because he was barely at home (due to be building Mazinger-Z).
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>: Kenzo Kabuto was even worse in that sense. He devoted several years of his life to building <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> to save the world, and training kids to pilot them. The result was his two biological children not even knowing he was alive -long story- and his adoptive son's huge issues never were addressed.

In Tenma's case it's less noticeable because he has a great social life <em>on</em> the job — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">he cares for his patients so much that he uses his spare time on them as well</a>. Lunge's obsessiveness drives his wife and daughter away, and it only gets worse when he decides to put himself into the mind of the man he's chasing (Tenma), who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> and willfully isolated himself from his family.
<ul><li> Lunge really brings it to the point of being horrific as he not only does lose his family but nearly gets fired from the very job he's married to due to his obsession.
</li><li> Criminal psychologist Dr. Gillen is another example, as his introductory scene has him explain that his wife left him because he listened more to his 20,000 tapes of observations on and quotes from criminals than he did to her.
</li><li> This is probably meant as an ironic contrast to Johann who manages to balance his job (spreading chaos and convincing Tenma the world deserves it) and forming relationships.
</li></ul></li><li> Shogun Yoshimune in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku">Ooku</a>: The Inner Chambers</em> may enjoy sex and have children, but make no mistake, she's too busy ruling a nation to bother with emotional attachments. When she's thinking about the country even during relaxing baths, hunting, and <em>childbirth</em>, it's clear she's this trope.
</li><li> Implied, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> , with pretty much all the Sailor Senshi aside for Usagi, with some making it clear:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbian">Haruka and Michiru</a> are clearly in love with each other since the start, but refused to act on it until they completed their mission against the Death Busters and they had (apparently) no reason to be Sailor Senshi anymore (when they <em>do</em> find out their mission had not ended, they graduate to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a>);
</li><li> The manga version of Rei had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFirstCutIsTheDeepest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFirstCutIsTheDeepest">already sworn off men for unrelated reasons</a>, but when tempted with the prospective of abandoning her duty and finding love she did not exitate into <em>burning down temptation and temptor</em>. She later appeared to <em>have</em> found love, but as it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Minako</a> it didn't get in the way of her duty in the slightest;
</li><li> The Sailor Star Lights make clear they value their mission to find their princess above everything else, with the anime having Yaten berating Minako (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">this series' poster child for the trope</a>) when it appeared she was about to put her dream of being an idol over her duty;
</li><li> As said above, Minako is the clearest example, as in all continuities she puts it well above her dream to be an idol and her love life: in the anime, where the element is at its lightest, an episode showing her choosing her duty over her love life and another having her placing her duty over the dream of being an idol (the above incident where Yaten berated her. Turns out, Minako not only just wanted to see if she had the ability to pull it off <em>after</em> all dangers had passed, but she <em>asked Usagi for permission before trying</em>); in the live action (the one continuity where she <em>is</em> an idol) at one point she came close to <em>reject her identity as Minako Aino</em> to better accomplish her duty (and it's hinted that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her dedication <em>literally</em> killed her, both by putting off the surgery for her terminal illness until her body couldn't take the surgery and by <em>causing it in first place</em> by working too much</span>; and in the manga, her first kill was <em>the boy she was crushing on</em> (turned out it was a youma), and later killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>her true love</em></span> upon learning he was from the Dark Kingdom, and even stated she had not need for men and that they were in the way of her duty (in a scene filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> between her and Rei, the one possible love who would <em>never</em> get in the way of her duty).

His mother-in-law, Dr. Kiriko Aoi (Anna's mother), also happens to be his boss.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em> is the reason because Rito and Mikan parents rarely make apparitions in the series. Their dad lives in his own apartment/studio where he does his work as a mangaka while their mom normally working overseas (once in a while she returns home to check up on the family).
</li><li> Both Kaiser and Asuka of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> use the "in love with dueling" line to let down attempted suitors.

The family is intentionally analogous to the family of director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>, who suffered from the same problem; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">Reality Subtext</a> of the film is an apology to his son Goro.

At some point during the time-skip between <em>Solid State Society</em> and the start of this show, he'd divorced his wife to devote more time to crime fighting.

Kurumada loves his wife very much, but eventually realizes that he puts so much priority on his work that Kumiko might be justified in leaving him. Of course, his fears are wrong.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyRhythmAuroraDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyRhythmAuroraDream">Pretty Rhythm Aurora Dream</a></em>, the main characters work their way towards the Prism Queen Cup, the most prestigious Prism Show tournament, in order to be crowned the Prism Queen. In order to enter, they must create a wedding outfit with rare wedding-related clothing earned from other tournaments and then put on a Prism Show that shows how much they love Prism Shows — basically, literally getting married to the job. A lot of this imagery is representative of Asian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> culture in general, where idols in real-life are expected to forego any romantic relationship and be devoted to their job.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingOfPrism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingOfPrism">King of Prism</a></em>, the marriage imagery happens again in the finale of <em>Shiny Seven Stars</em>, where the main characters' Prism Show is basically a wedding where the audience (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation">yes, even you</a>) gets married to them.

In a later comic, the entire superhero community teams up to pick up the slack so that Samaritan and Winged Victory can have an evening free to go on a date, without feeling duty-bound to interrupt it to save civilians or fight villains.

It's implied that Leland sometimes sleeps at his office.
</li><li> In the start of season five, Stottlemeyer does pick up a girlfriend in the form of suave realtor Linda Fusco, but it doesn't last. The first reason is that Stottlemeyer's police duties means that their dates are frequently interrupted, postponed, or cancelled completely, to the point in "Mr. Monk and His Biggest Fan," Linda has to "buy" Stottlemeyer at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BachelorAuction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BachelorAuction">Bachelor Auction</a> to secure a date with him, which of course gets interrupted by him making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a> in a murder case, forcing him to ditch her to save Monk and Marci Maven from a killer. And then Monk and Natalie expose her as a murderer.
</li><li> His third marriage, to Trudy "T.K." Jensen, doesn't seem to suffer from this trope.
</li><li> Natalie also observes this about Stottlemeyer in <em>Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu</em>. When she and Monk happen to notice Stottlemeyer sitting in his car outside Monk's apartment, Natalie notes that he's in his SFPD issue-Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor:

So you'd think that when they bought their own cars, they'd want something entirely different, something less big, boxy, and official. But no. They don't feel comfortable in "civilian" cars. They want to be cops at home, too. Which may be why divorce rates among cops are so high. Perhaps if they ditched their Crown Vics, they would less likely be ditched themselves.</em>

David Sinclair and Colby Granger seem to consider this a badge of honor, or at least an excuse why they aren't in relationships. Nikki meanwhile, while devoted, does try and date. Granted, said relationships don't work out for circumstances (a date bailed because of an unexpected connection and her romance with the sniper was put on hold when he had to serve time.)

Unlike most examples of this trope, he doesn't want this to be the <em>entire</em> case, and he has attempted to have a dating life multiple times, and in one episode ("Something in the Heir") tried to adopt a child to carry on his family business. The main problem is that his family business job, which he loves talking about and spends a great deal of time doing, is sucking sewage out of septic tanks.

</div><ul><li> In season 4, McNulty makes some effort to break this trope, demoting himself down to patrol work in the Western District (away from the rigorously demanding work of the Major Crimes Unit), cutting back on his drinking and getting into a relationship with Beadie Russell, the Port Authority cop from the Sobotka detail of season 2.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> is this trope. Mulder is obsessed with his work, so much so that he can't even fathom a relationship or even many friendships outside of it. His one goal in life is to expose the Truth and find out what happened to his sister. Scully starts off with somewhat of a personal life and even goes on a date in the first season, but eventually becomes just as entangled in the work as Mulder. This <em>is</em> somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>, however. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> cases aren't something that can easily be left in the office each night, and the line between work and personal life is obliterated. Especially when Mulder and Scully start getting abducted, their apartments are bugged, and are almost murdered several times in their own homes. Scully once acknowledges this self-destructive lifestyle in season six, asking Mulder if he ever just wanted to "get out of the damn car and live something approaching a normal life?" Mulder's reply? "This is a normal life." Also, work/personal life get even more entangled when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their son becomes the first gested human/alien hybrid, and thus all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> villians from their work would like to kidnap him and/or kill him.</span>

(before Artie himself has even realised he's gay) she tells him "It'll never work, honey, he's married to grammar" before adding as an afterthought "And actually married."

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em>, Princess Carolyn is absolutely dedicated to her job as a Hollywoo talent agent. So dedicated, in fact, that a shot in Season 2 shows her smartphone wishing her a happy 40th birthday while she's pulling an all-nighter at work. This also extends to her personal life; in a flashback to 2007, Princess Carolyn said she wanted to get married, have kids, and settle down. Later in life, she's done none of these things. Even the one seemingly-good relationship she has in Season 4 gets ruined when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has a miscarriage. Her fifth one, as she reveals to her boyfriend</span>. All of this takes a heavy toll on her emotional state.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says this is why they resisted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> to give Perry a girlfriend.

So devoted, in fact, that when he is forced to take a break in "Bummer Vacation," he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">goes <em>nuts</em></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: When Bart claims that he has a girlfriend, Groundskeeper Willy proclaims that he does too. She's a... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlfriendInCanada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlfriendInCanada">bikini model. From Sweden</a>. Yep. Right after Bart leaves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she comes out of his shack and asks him to come to bed, to which he replies that she shouldn't try to compete with his job, because she'll never win.</span>

For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">some reason</a>, Ice interprets her to mean this trope. (To be fair, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a> episode implies that that's sort of true too.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em>, Alfred has said this about Bruce on two occasions. In one episode, where Bruce has to cancel a blind date and sends Alfred to apologize, the date asks if Bruce is married. Alfred replies, "Yes... To his work." In another episode, Selina Kyle sighs and asks Alfred if Bruce Wayne is married. Alfred replies, "Only to his job, Miss Kyle."
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em> has Sam's father paying him a visit and offering to spend quality time with Sam and his friends. Unfortunately, everywhere the group goes, Sam's father is always on his cellphone conducting business calls instead of having fun with the kids, much to Sam's dismay. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Eventually</a>, Sam and his dad reconcile and decide to dedicate a day to just bonding as father and son; the next time Sam's father gets a call, he simply tosses the ringing phone in the trunk of the car and they laugh it off.

<ul><li> As shown by this <a class="urllink" href="http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/784/Another-Long-Winded-Explanation-of-Various-Things">list<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of projects, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a> definitely counts.
</li></ul><ul><li> In an unusually literal form of this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor">Queen Elizabeth I</a> declared herself 'married to the kingdom' and never married, laying claim to the moniker 'the Virgin Queen'.
</li><li> The widow of Meiji revolutionary Katsura Kogoro supposedly lamented: "I may be his wife, but Japan is his mistress."
</li><li> In Jung Chang's autobiographical novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildSwans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildSwans">Wild Swans</a></em>, it's described that in China, in the early times of the Communist regime, it was explicitly required for Party officers (like her father) to put their jobs before their families.
</li><li> Drill sergeants have markedly higher divorce rates, especially in Combat Arms OSUTs, which are much longer, more intensive and stressful than Basic Training. Due to the Uniformed Services Former Spouse Protection Act of 1982, the wife will get half of all pay, pension and benefits in the case of divorce unless found guilty of adultery, so some D.I.s who fear they'll be unable to hold onto their marriage will attempt to catch their spouse cheating, putting additional strain on the relationship.
</li><li> Renaissance-era Venice had a symbolic form of this. When a new Doge was installed, he would take part in a ritual where he would throw a wedding band into the bay. The ritual symbolized Venice's eternal link with commerce: the Doge, as representative of Venice, was wedded to the sea, which brought trade to Venice.
</li><li> Working at companies like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Google-Reviews-E9079.htm">Google<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Facebook-Reviews-E40772.htm">Facebook<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> One of the "Ten Commandments" of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> is "Always being available for Cosa Nostra is a duty — even if your wife is about to give birth."
</li><li> At least milder variants of this are widely expected in Japanese business culture, especially for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Salaryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Salaryman">Salaryman</a>. This was one of the reasons why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld">Japan Takes Over the World</a> trope was so prevalent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. It is also often pointed to as one of the main reasons for the later negative population growth in Japan.
</li><li> This also appears to be the case in American business culture, mainly due to the smaller social safety net compared to other industrialized countries making it necessary to work longer. The U.S. has no mandatory paid days off, and American workers take fewer days off compared with people in the rest of the world. Profiles of executives in the business world stress the dedication they have to the company.
</li><li> As the <em>West Wing</em> entry above noted, many White House positions see high turnover rates because the stress tends to lead to job burnout. The trope even applies to the President:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> hardly ever even saw his young daughters during his days as Senate Majority Leader, and only after he suffered a heart attack in 1955 did he begin to recognize that his life was so lopsided as to be ridiculous  [and that] there was something else besides my job.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter">Jimmy Carter</a> occasionally carved out time to play with his youngest child, Amy, he was an absentee dad to his three sons, Jack, Chip and Jeff.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/19/obamas-most-unusual-legacy-being-a-good-dad/?tid=sm_fb">Heavily averted with<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JDSalinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JDSalinger">J. D. Salinger</a>'s children report he that was much more invested in his fictional families than his actual one.
</li><li> Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU project and the free software movement, has elected to never marry or have children since he it would distract him from his work to promote software freedom.
</li><li> Though it's not quite a job per se, college students in project driven coursework (especially ones with an unhealthy fear of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBGrade">The B Grade</a>) have been known to become so obsessed over their projects as to neglect other aspects of their life. In an added bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>, this can sometimes include calling in sick at their actual jobs, if they have them, to devote even more time to said projects.
</li><li> Many religious orders require their members to be single. In the case of Christian nuns this is even expressed in terms of them being married to Christ.
</li><li> The film industry's combination of very long hours and unpredictable scheduling is devastating for marriages. The working week often leaves only enough off time for sleeping, and it's not uncommon to finish the work week at 5am on Saturday morning (called "Fraturday") with the expectation you'll be ready to work at 7am Monday, leaving only 50 hours of free time. The contract nature of film makes it hard to turn down work, as you don't know when you'll get your next job, preventing you from taking longer holidays. Relationships fare much better if both are in the industry.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> cultures in Asia reinforce the idea that singers remain celibate as long as they are still idols. While part of it is due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a>, it mostly has to do with potential backlash from their fans, whose financial loyalty influences their popularity and the longevity of their career. Because idols are now marketed as a way for fans to project their ideal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> onto, fans claim that idols being in relationships will mean that they are not devoted to their job and their fans, which is also enforced by Asian work culture mentality. Newbie and rookie idol singers are less likely to reveal their relationships publicly, if they are even dating at all to begin with. Some talent companies have rules on not having any romantic relationships written on their contracts.
