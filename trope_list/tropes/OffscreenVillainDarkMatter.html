</p><p>We know how it goes. The good guy defeats the villain. Whatever the villain stole is returned, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Doomsday Device</a> is blown up. <em>Every single time.</em>
</p><p>Yet, time after time again, the villain is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">right back at it again next week</a>, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMinions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMinions">Evil Minions</a> at the ready.

</p><p>How on earth does he fund this? Why does anyone take him seriously anymore? The only possible explanation is that there have to be scores of successful operations the villain is undertaking that we're not seeing... much like how scientists speculate that there's "dark matter" in the universe — substances that can't be directly observed, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple">must exist if our observations are correct</a>.

It is suggested that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">true leader</a> of Galactor, the alien Sousai X, somehow has the massive personal resources to keep the operation going.
</li><li> Dr. Hell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> has the resources to build over one hundred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Mechanical Beasts</a>, two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperVillainLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperVillainLair">Super Villain Lairs</a>, several -aerial or submarine- fortresses and war machines, and he has an infinite supply of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>. It was explained on a chapter of one of the manga versions Count Brocken -one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">Co-Dragons</a>- had taken over several European crime organizations long before the beginning of the manga and was using their resources to fund Hell's operation. And regarding how Hell has an endless army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>... It was justified, but the answer is pure horror: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All his subordinates are corpses he has turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Cyborgs</a> personally.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats">Samurai Pizza Cats</a></em>, the Big Cheese has a surprising amount to spend on giant killer robots. However, this gets subverted when he runs out of funding in one episode and has his Ninja Crows working at minimum wage to scrounge up funds, and in the finale, we find out he's been embezzling from the royal court, to the point where there wasn't enough left to buy an ice cream cone. The princess was mighty peeved when her check bounced.

<ul><li> It straddles a bizarre mix of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualPoverty">Perpetual Poverty</a>. Despite the fact that they're often depicted as being cut off from the rest of their organization, generally ignored and frequently starving, not even being able to afford a motor for their pedal-powered submarine, they always have money to build an insanely huge robotic contraption or some other such nonsense to capture Pikachu and/or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> with (which subsequently gets destroyed by whichever of the aforementioned two was not captured.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">You'd think they'd either start selling their mechanical prowess for profit</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">stop buying machines and start buying food, but...</a>
</li><li> They once realized they could make a lot of money just selling souvenirs for the some tournament or another, and set themselves to go into legit business doing so. They succeeded just after the tournament was over and the demand was gone, leaving them out of money, again.
</li><li> Part of the reason could also be that James' family is <em>hilariously</em> wealthy (their compound is the size of a village, one of their summer homes which they hadn't used since James was 6 was still being upkept and probably cost the real-world equivalent of 2 million dollars). Presumably, whenever Team Rocket HQ won't give them funding they get the money to buy one of their ridiculous mechs from James withdrawing from his personal account. Why they don't use that to buy food is still anyone's guess though.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> villains, except for the ones who are directly involved in organized crime and fencing (like the Penguin).
<ul><li> This trope was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in one episode of the 1990s animated series, with the Scarecrow infecting star athletes with his fear poison and then betting against them for huge sums of money. When Batman confronts him, the Scarecrow explains that chemicals and other research materials are very expensive...
</li><li> In some versions, The Riddler's goons seem to <em>like</em> their boss. In the comic book tie-in to the Animated Series, some of them were worried about him suffering a nervous breakdown if Batman solved one more of Ed's riddles (of course, it might just be that Mr. Nygma is comparatively pleasant as Gotham villains go). Similarly, one comic in which the Joker planted time-bombs in Gotham had one of his goons joking about working for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TwoFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TwoFace">Two-Face</a>, and describing Batman's oncoming fist as "quitting time".
</li><li> There have also been a couple of times we see henchmen who have worked for multiple villains in the past (one issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a> even has them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion">trying to unionize</a>), and this always leads to a certain amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> as they discuss their former bosses. Apparently the Penguin actually offers health coverage and a 401K, and Riddler is a nice enough boss who pays well and gives lots of time off. Joker's secret is just how mercurial he is; he'll throw wads of cash at you one minute (he doesn't really value money), then kill you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">for lulz</a> the next. It's a gamble, but can be a profitable one. One wonders if they look forward to getting pummeled by Batman, considering it's the easy way out.
</li><li> Brian Azzarello's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Joker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Joker">Joker</a></em> graphic novel seems to suggest that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">the Clown Prince</a> is a silent partner/co-owner of a local strip club (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016">Suicide Squad (2016)</a></em> ran with this idea), and hires Penguin as a stockbroker to ensure a steady flow of cash. While working with Joker is undoubtedly risky, it's probably also good insurance against anyone who might want to make trouble. Who's going to mess with <em>the Joker's</em> club? The story also shows that if he needs a quick boost he just has to walk up to a bank with a picture of the director's daughter.

A rare exception is the evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HYDRA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HYDRA">HYDRA</a>, which was funded with hidden Nazi assets, and (in one case) structured itself as a <em>corporation!</em> (Not openly, of course.) HYDRA also controls a small nation. Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), another terrorist group that broke off from HYDRA and became independent, also generates revenue by developing and selling deadly high-tech devices. This could arguably explain where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys">many Marvel villains get all their fancy toys.</a>

Lately we often see them more realistically broke, but they've also been seen going after Scrooge McDuck at sea or elsewhere with special equipment that should probably cost more than the amount of money they were after, when it wasn't Scrooge's entire property. An explanation might have something to do with how they're (rarely) shown as a world-wide criminal organisation family of which the Duckburg gang is just a small part, but it still wouldn't make much sense. A possible explanation comes from Italian stories showing they are actually <em>formidable</em> thieves and only Scrooge or bad luck can stop them, implying they fund their special equipment to go after Scrooge with the loot of other heists.

The money trail being big and complex is one reason it was so hard to pin anything on him for a long time.
</li><li> In the graphic novel, "Revenge of the Living Monolith", the title supervillain is the leader of a centuries-old religious cult that still worships the Pharaohs, and also possesses vast underground bases described as rivaling anything Washington or Moscow could built, fleets of high-tech vehicles that could turn half the world's dictators green with envy and the other half with fear, atomic generators enough to power a city, and consisting of thousands of agents from around the world. The comic never explains how a simple cult acquired such resources.

He also exploits any available resources that can produce raw materials and assembly for him, such as Ra Moon or the Skull Egg Zone. After the comic's take on the third game, billionaire Mr. X provides funding for Wily's plans, implying this is how Wily can afford to go until at least the seventh game.

The comics do make a much better effort at explaining where their resources come from than the animated series. Cobra is shown being involved in various legitimate, though highly corrupt businesses. They even sell military equipment they themselves designed and built to some shady government officials from small countries, presumably the kind who have little chance of making any deals with the U.S. government.

It isn't long after the Light exiles leave that the Death Eaters learn that it was regular honest Light supporters who had provided nearly all the goods and services, but by then it was too late. The specific example is given of the time when the Ministry of Magic's magical lifts began breaking down. Not only had the clerk who oversaw the maintenance left in the Exodus, so had the artificers he had previously contracted. In the end, the Death Eaters had to hire expensive goblin artificers simply because none of them had the kind of skills necessary to fix the problem.

In other words, Blofeld <em>doesn't</em> have unlimited funds of money and every time he or his organisation is defeated by James Bond he gets closer and closer to going totally broke!
</li><li> The Virtucon Corporation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">Austin Powers</a></em> is a wonderful example, and satirizes the trope when Number Two points out to Doctor Evil that the company makes more money from its legitimate activities than Dr. Evil originally wanted from his latest evil scheme.

His backstory is that he's an engineer, which explains how he can design everything, and one movie showed that Jigsaw was part of a lucrative real estate deal, which explains how he got all the buildings, plus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he has a few apprentices to help him build the traps</span>. But that does not explain how he can get all the materials for the traps (apparently with no paper trail the police could immediately investigate), some of which are really elaborate, and find the time to build them all.
<ul><li> One possible explanation is that, since this film series makes heavy use of flashbacks and has multiple movies happening concurrently, and since Jigsaw is shown to heavily plan ahead, he had already got his hand on those materials and built or at least drawn designs for many of these traps before the police even catch onto him; it is also shown in later movies that he had a <em>lot</em> of offscreen cultists / minions who help him do his dirty work. Admittedly, even this only goes so far, as some of his traps are ridiculously elaborate, especially since at least some of them were built or used by aforementioned underlings rather than Jigsaw himself, despite Jigsaw being the only engineer in his cult.

On a world that nobody can access inhabited only by his personal cult he somehow built and crewed what's explicitly stated to be the largest fleet ever assembled. And every one of those ships has a main gun that can blow up planets. The movie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Visual Dictionary</a> states that this fleet was built by several companies and organizations secretly run by his cultists across the galaxy. At least that's <em>an</em> explanation. Yet, it's impressive that all of this was kept a secret from the New Republic and other space civilizations for decades, and that these various NGOs, in secret, managed to build an explicitly larger navy than the Galactic Empire, which ruled <em>the entire flippin' galaxy and nationalized most of the major corporations.</em>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>: A handful of examples of this, but Season 4's Marwan is the biggest example. Marwan, unlike all of the other villains of the show (essentially), is the only one who is the real baddie directly squaring off against the heroes for more than roughly half a season. As a result of often having to alternate between his terror plots and how he consistently escapes arrest raids, Marwan seems to be replenishing his resources of manpower, technicians, firearms and safehouses every few episodes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AuctionKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AuctionKings">Auction Kings</a></em>, one of the recurring bidders mentions that she won the lottery. She uses this money to buy antiques. Certainly the other bidders must think of her as this trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLeftovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLeftovers">The Leftovers</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Guilty Remnant is a nihilistic cult which devotes all its resources to their goal of reminding people of the Great Departure. Its members have no apparent jobs, there's no hint of dues or entrance fees, and in general they are never shown doing anything but being annoying loiterers. Despite this, they're able to buy large amounts of property to house their membership or seemingly just to be jerks. In particular, they're able to afford a truckload of corpse dolls made up to look like Mapleton's Departed residents. Each one of these things has a $40,000 price tag, and Mapleton has 100 Departed. Even if one charitably assumes the truck only has the two dozen or so shown, that's still nearly half a million dollars they blew on a stunt.
</li><li> Holy Wayne's cult is a subversion. He initially has access to a substantial amount of cash, some of which is given to Tom, but as the season progresses it's shown that he charges exorbitant fees for his "gift" and still lives like a hobo half the time (being a wanted fugitive, his options are limited). By the end of the season, Tom has completely run out of money and Holy Wayne <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies in a bathroom of a fast food restaurant from a gunshot wound</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em> averts this. From prison in season 2, Wilson Fisk is bleeding through what limited funds that the federal government didn't seize when he was arrested, between what it's costing him to pay his three-man protection crew on the inside and what outside money is being spent manipulating/bribing FBI agents as part of his later plans to take control of that organization that will come to frutition in season 3. He's not able to secure a new source of funding until he arranges Dutton's murder at the hands of Frank Castle, then takes over Dutton's prison contraband business. It is this new revenue, which he has Felix Manning launder through Red Lion Bank, that allows him to buy the Presidential Hotel before he puts into motion his plans to trick Ray Nadeem into letting him out.
</li><li> Even harder averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016">Luke Cage (2016)</a></em>.
<ul><li> In season 1, Luke is able to take out 80% of Cottonmouth's money in the span of a day, and Cottonmouth is forced to start collecting extortion money from businesses to recuperate.
</li><li> In season 2, Mariah explicitly needs to raise $20 million to invest in a shady stock deal regarding the merger of Atreus Plastics and Glenn Industries, which for her means selling off the Stokes' guns to the Yardies in Brooklyn. Only for said Yardies to be headed by Bushmaster, who wants Mariah dead over an old score his parents had with her grandparents. Mariah is quickly crippled in a matter of days due to Bushmaster having the upper hand, with him killing her banker after forcing him to bankrupt her, and burning down her brownstone. The tide then turns in episode 9 after Luke thwarts an attempt by Bushmaster to kill Mariah at a safehouse provided by Danny Rand, which gives Mariah the chance to regroup and get the upper hand in the war as she gets her money back and has henchmen, while Bushmaster is now a solo operator since all of his henchmen have been captured.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> No matter how often we're told that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">House Lannister</a> is running out of troops or the supplies necessary to raise them, they always seem to have enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>. Even after losing 30,000 men in season 1 with Jaime, thousands more in season 2 with Tyrion at King's Landing, <em>and</em> several thousand others at Oxcross in season 3 with Stafford, they're <em>still</em> stated to have the largest army in Westeros in season 5. This may be finally averted by the end of season seven, when after losing a large number of troops at the hands of Daenerys's dragons, the Golden Company (an Essosi mercenary army) is hired using gold the Iron Bank lent the Lannisters. This is all in stark contrast to the books on which the show is based: the Lannister army is only about equal to that of the Stark, Tully, or Arryn armies, and about half the size of the Tyrell army, which is why Tywin sucks up so much to Mace and Olenna and why Renly (backed by the Tyrells) was viewed as an easy victor at the beginning of the war. By the end of book three.
</li><li> Played even worse by Euron Greyjoy, who is able to built a whole new powerful Iron Fleet even after his niece stole the best ones in a matter of months. Even if he does have the riches to pay for it (thanks to his pillaging), the Ironborns live on rocky islands with few trees. All we know is he ordered the men to cut down the wood of their own houses and use drapes for sails, and yet it results in the strongest fleet shown on-screen, and it completely demolishes both Yara's fleet when they are escorting Ellaria and the Sand Snakes to Dorne and the Dornish fleet when they attack Casterly Rock. Furthermore, even if he did have the money <em>and</em> the wood, it still would have taken years to build so many ships. Heck, even if he had the money, the wood, AND a time machine, he'd still need tens of thousands of experienced oarsmen, marines, officers, archers, and artillery crew to man the fleet, which all just seem to appear out of nowhere.

It was later revealed that he has been the head of an universe-spanning evil organization the whole time that possessed vast resources. What's more, all the nasties he had let go on the island so far weren't even the true big shots — he didn't really want to defeat the heroes, just stall them until his plan was ready to be set into motion. If not for this plan, the heroes wouldn't have lasted a day on the island.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The Chaos Marines of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> never seem to run out of supplies despite having been fighting the Imperium (and each other) for the best part of 10,000 years. This has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">justified recently</a> with "daemon forge worlds" and a much greater emphasis on Renegade Marines (recently turned to Chaos) than the Traitor Legions (ten thousand years of war against the God-Emperor).
<ul><li> Traitor Marines also often raid Imperial supplies and use Loyalist geneseed from dead Marines to make more Chaos Marines. They also don't use the technology that would require extremely high amounts of maintenance like anti-gravity vehicles and assault cannons. Being able to bind Daemons into their machines helps to keep them working, too.
</li><li> It's worth noting that the majority of Chaos Marines operate from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Eye of Terror</a>, where the laws of physics are a funny joke you tell your friends. In other words, they have <em>literal</em> Offscreen Villain Dark Matter at their disposal. The Alpha Legion, the only Traitor Legion that doesn't, are low-key guerrilla warfare specialists and seldom attack the Imperium openly in large-scale campaigns. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightLords">Night Lords</a> also often avert this as well, which is turn leaves them perpetually understaffed and under-supplied with deteriorating gear.
</li><li> In the Warp they can probably conjure up anything they desire, so long as it has a daemonic motif to it, and is probably cursed in some way.
</li><li> Warhammer 40k Novels involving the Chaos Space Marines frequently have some mention of their scavenging and raiding tactics. They steal ammunition, armor, gene-seed, ships, and vehicles from the Imperium and especially Loyalists Space Marines, meaning every successful fight makes them stronger.
</li><li> Fabius Bile is an important character that each Traitor Legion deals with because he can, depending on the author, create new organs or cloned soldiers.
</li><li> The Eldar are a perplexing example. They are apparently on the brink of extinction with only a dozen or so active Craftworlds and miniscule armed forces for a war that spans the galaxy, but neither the gameplay nor the story reflect this, repeatedly throwing away hundreds, thousands of soldiers on futile endeavors and generally having little better regard for their soldiers than the Imperium. It should be noted that the Eldar only have small numbers when compared to the other races. Each Craftworld is a planet sized ship that houses billions, which is small when you compare it to the trillions of humans.
</li><li> The Necrons mostly rely on the same numbers and resources they had back when they waged war against the Old Ones. Fortunately for them, they're built to last and are able to teleport themselves away for repairs if they are defeated.
</li><li> Da Orks' technology is crude enough that they don't really <em>need</em> much to make more of it. Numbers are not an issue either: Orks are basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomMan">giant mushrooms</a> who release spores upon death that eventually grow into new Orks. The only reason Orks haven't overrun the galaxy through sheer numbers is infighting.
</li><li> Tyranids don't need anything but biomass to remain a viable threat. They are so efficient at consuming and processing it that every victory makes them stronger.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the Chaos Warriors faction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy">Warhammer Fantasy</a></em> hails from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth">the harshest and least fertile areas</a> of the Old World and have an economy based entirely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a>, yet they somehow always seem to be able to invade Kislev and the Empire with vast hordes of men they shouldn't be able to feed, surprisingly many of whom are dressed in full plate mail and wielding advanced weapons they don't have the infrastructure to build or maintain. The lore basically chalks this up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a>, and that the Chaos Dwarves do most of the smithing for them in return for vast numbers of slaves that the Chaos Warriors take during their invasions, which implies there's a brisk business in platemail indeed considering how many chaos warriors die each time there's an invasion with nobody left to recover their equipment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em> averts this trope; despite being supernatural-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPoweredPseudoScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPoweredPseudoScience">Magic Powered Pseudo Science</a>, Geniuses aren't capable of pulling the materials and space needed to build their Wonders out of nowhere- they still need money for that.

<ul><li> Despite being clearly both evil and insane and even jailed multiple times, Doctor Wily of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a></em> is always able to build at least eight new war robots and a fortress. Well, except when he manipulates Cossack in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4">the fourth game</a> or tricks various national representatives in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6">the sixth</a>, anyway. Maybe he just uses really cheap parts; after all, he <em>did</em> make one of his robots out of wood.
<ul><li> His fortresses. Those things are huge, requiring poor ol' Mega four or even <em>five</em> stages to traverse. And there's a new one every time? How is Wily doing it? Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Sigma</a>, who apparently thinks that bigger is better, creating a <em>floating island</em> in the first game, and topping it every. Single. Time. Mainly by using other people's facilities.
</li><li> While the <em>speed</em> of setting up his fortress and robot army is never explained, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9">Mega Man 9</a></em> manages to give believable reasons to Wily's supplies: The Robot Masters are actually Dr. Light's own robots that were reprogrammed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because Wily tricked them into thinking he could make them more useful before they became expired scrap</span>, and Wily got his funding by <em>holding a telethon</em> so he could build robots to combat the berserk Light-bots (which he <em>obviously</em> did not use for the public's intended purpose). Considering the general reactions of some people in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, Wily's entire scheme in this game seems plausible.
</li><li> Perhaps he starts off with a single Sniper Joe, which he uses to steal supplies for more Joes, until he gets enough supplies to build a Robot Master, who steals supplies at a faster rate than the Joes. Exponential growth and whatnot. As for why Mega Man doesn't notice? He's really good at being stealthy. As for the fortresses, by that point, he'll have an entire army of robots to build it lightning fast.
</li><li> The series's extraneous material sometimes gives handwaves. Crystal Man from <em>5</em> was built to create crystals to sell for funds. As his stage is literally made of diamonds, it's obvious that's a main source of income, baring obvious economic issues. Junk Man, from <em>7,</em> collects spare parts on his massive electromagnets. Some of the places that Robot Masters have taken over were for the purpose of obtaining funding and materials. Descriptions of some of the rank-and-file enemies also explain that some of their weaknesses are the result of cost-cutting measures, implying that building a massive robot army every game has left him with money troubles.
</li><li> Some of the character CDs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanAndBass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanAndBass">Megaman And Bass</a></em> explain that several robots were the result of limited resources on his part. Gyro Man was built with a helicopter rather than a jetpack or levitation device to limit costs, and Frost Man was built from the leftover parts of Clown Man.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirates">the Bonne Family</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em> who constantly suffer from financial problems that hinder their operation. While they started with decent resources in the first game they were ultimately forced to steal boats to build Balcon Gelede and their ship in the end is barely cobbled together from the parts of their other machines. The massive refractor they got away with in the end funded them enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">attempt to go straight</a> but Tiesel's poor business sense saw them right back in the can and forced to resort to piracy once more. <em>The Misadventures of Tron Bonne</em> shows them to be quite successful at both digging and theft when the Blue Bomber isn't around to foil them, explaining that their "offscreen dark matter" is simply them being good at their job and at reusing or acquiring parts.
</li><li> While the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> series generally played it straight, <em>Mega Man Network Transmission</em> averted it. The Professor enacted his scheme using leftover WWW resources and spread the Zero Virus via selling fake vaccines in order to raise the money for his real plan for rebuilding the Life Virus.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>
<ul><li> The series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waves</a> this by having Dr. Eggman seemingly get the funds for his schemes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasinoPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasinoPark">Casino Night Zone</a>. Doesn't do so very well because Sonic tends to gain far more rings than he loses whenever he passes through the Zone, making it far more generous than any real-life casino. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle">Sonic Battle</a></em> also went into much more detail about this: Eggman has his robots often commit small-time thefts too petty to attract the attention of Sonic, and he also sells stripped down versions of his robots to other corporations and companies to have a steady supply of cash while keeping the real good stuff for himself.
</li><li> In addition to selling Guard Robos for extra cash in <em>Sonic Battle</em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders">Sonic Riders</a></em> series reveals that he also owns two companies, Robotnik Corp — which sells air boards — and MeteorTech, a company that develops security robots. Yet another company, Eggman Enterprises, is mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors">Sonic Colors</a></em>, although it may be the same company as Robotnik Corp.
</li><li> Beyond just "monetary" issues is the fact that Eggman's machines must require an utterly massive amount of natural resources and time to construct (not even factoring in R&amp;D time), yet he always has some new, extensive machine on the ready when his last one fails. It doesn't help that beyond all the robots he has built, he has seemingly no other sentient biological creature with any significant role in his operations.
</li><li> One of the most notable examples is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em>. The Egg Carrier, an absolutely massive aerial battleship is destroyed. Near the end of the game, Eggman reveals that he had another one.
</li><li> Even more absurd then the Egg Carrier was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Death Egg</a>, which first appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic 2</a></em>. It was a giant space station, similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">the famous Death Star</a>. How could Doctor Eggman pay for that? It was explained in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em> that he was at least trying to repair rather than replace the Death Egg, but that doesn't explain the numerous <em>extra</em> space stations he whips up in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy">Sonic Advance Trilogy</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em>, Eggman produces a fleet of <em>entirely expendable</em> space ships solely for the purpose of luring Super Sonic into attacking his hidden superweapon.
<ul><li> Ditto for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Egg Fleet and Final Fortress</a>. Hell, every ship in Final Fortress could very well be a fortress in themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> One of E-123 Omega's lines in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em> is "Worthless consumer models!," implying that Eggman produces and sells lower-quality robots for personal use. One of Vector's idle lines from the same game has him wonder how Eggman manages to afford all of this stuff, and wonders if he'll hire the Chaotix Detective Agency. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">irony</a> of that statement being Eggman <em>did</em> hire them since he's their mysterious client offering a vast payment for rescuing him while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Metal Sonic</a> is running around pretending to be him. Of course, Eggman reveals he <em>doesn't</em> have the money for them (presumably he or Metal spent it all on the fleet in question for this game) and has to leg it in the epilogue. Apparently, it never occurred to him to offer a ship or two as compensation.</span>
</li><li> Seemingly justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em>, when Dr. Eggman gets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacguffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacguffin">Phantom Ruby</a>.

Assuming he's telling the truth, and given how much the Heavy <em>uses</em> the thing in the game, that might bring his expenses almost equal to the US National Debt by this point.
</li><li> RED and BLU's income is justified as being a globally owned and controlled industrial military complex, but where in the world did Gray Mann get the spending power to build a seemingly infinite number of robots that run on <em>money</em>?

The game's plot takes place over the course of 18 days, meaning the Marine Corps and Blackwatch go through more than the <em>entire US military budget for 2010 in a little over half a month</em>. Keep in mind, this all takes place exclusively on Manhattan Island. Probably partially justified by how long they've been receiving a blank check, all those weapons and armaments were likely accumulated over a couple decades, barring the Thermobaric tanks. Also justified by the fact that, considering the circumstances, they're not going to get shut down for going over budget. As for where they're getting that money? It's the US government — we're already trillions of dollars in debt, what's a few billion more?

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>: Despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller">Basement-Dweller</a> and living on a teacher's salary, Crocker can somehow afford to build fancy, fairy-finding gadgets. Subverted in Wishology when he explains to Mark that he pilfered the school's science fund to build his lab.
</li><li> The Monarch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBros">The Venture Bros.</a></em> crashes or takes heavy damage to his Cocoon about once or twice a season, and his henchmen suffer pretty heavy casualties fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">Brock Samson</a>. His only criminal efforts are to harass Doctor Venture, and even if he ever were successful, it's unlikely he could recoup the losses. Despite this, he usually manages to rebuild very quickly. It's suggested that he has both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarilyLargeBankAccount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarilyLargeBankAccount">a very large trust fund</a> and a habit of stealing equipment from other villains, which explains this a bit. In the sixth season, though, the Cocoon ends up getting blown up along with all hands lost, his trust fund is finally overdrawn and he ends up having to relocate to his parent's old home, carrying out supervillainy with nothing but the equipment he had on hand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until he finds his late father's secret identity as the vigilante hero Blue Morpho and uses his 1960s era super science technology to arch Dr. Venture's new arches.</span>
</li><li> The Mechanic of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderbirdsAreGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderbirdsAreGo">Thunderbirds Are Go</a></em> is apparently conjuring giant digging machines, spacecraft, electricity-spewing remote-operated robotic insects, etc. out of thin air. He has no apparent source of income, but still has whatever he needs to try to get parts for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a>, break his boss out of prison, or whatever.
</li><li> Addressed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League Unlimited</a></em> episode "Flash and Substance". At the beginning of the episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Flash's enemies</a> commiserate about being so broke that they've been reduced to fairly petty crimes and might even have to get honest jobs. After Captain Boomerang tries and fails to kill Flash with a giant boomerang, he tries to get the other Rogues to chip in, an idea they dismiss out of hand.
</li><li> The Legion of Doom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends">Superfriends</a></em> were never successful, but still managed to scrape together all kinds of ridiculous schemes. A fairly infamous episode involved a planet of evil robot toys in the middle of a black hole on the other side of the galaxy, as part of a scheme to extort the UN for money. It's hard to imagine how a <em>planet of toys</em> could run you less money than anything the UN could give you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em>, considering Robotnik's claimed territory is all but one forest on an entire planet and started with a successful coup on the primary goverment, he's got a whole planet to mine for resources to justify this trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, Robotnik played it pretty straight, considering how many massive schemes he could off every Saturday morning. Interestingly, his lair is destroyed at the end of "Robo-Ninjas" and stays as such, implying Sonic had finally drained his bank account enough through his victories to prevent its reconstruction.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicUnderground">Sonic Underground</a></em>, Robotnik uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">Bread and Circuses</a> trope to keep the upper crust of Mobius in line. They keep funding him, and he keeps them living in relative peace.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>, Eggman owns a legitimate business called Eggman Industries which supplies all purpose products across the world. This is apparently what allows him to work on taking over Seaside Island and start this continuity's version of Eggman Land.
