<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a first-season episode, Nabiki gives aspirin to Ryōga in the middle of his first on-screen challenge fight with Ranma, and tells him that they're basically instant steroids. Ryōga, who is not the sharpest spoon in the drawer, believes her and upon taking them gets a psychosomatic boost to his already monstrous strength, allowing him to pull telephone poles from the ground simply because he thinks he is on steroids (which don't even work that way).
</li><li> In a much later episode, Happōsai, ticked off at Ranma interfering with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyThief">undie raids</a>, takes Kunō and offers him "Speed of Light elixir", which he claims will make him super fast.

Said "elixir" is revealed to actually be tap water and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">the scrapings from under Happosai's fingernails</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VampirePrincessMiyu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VampirePrincessMiyu">Vampire Princess Miyu</a></em> episode "The Red Shoes". The titular shoes are given to Miyu's classmate Miho (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> and aspiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a>) by her manager, and stated to magically make her an unparalleled singer. And they actually <em>do just that</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But they do so by sucking her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a>, and worse yet, once Miyu has defeated the Shinma who gave them to poor Miho, they can never be removed again. Miyu has to bite her friend and exchange blood with her in order to save her life. When last seen, Miho is physically better, but she's confined in an hospital.</span><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0nle2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0nle2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0nle2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This episode is in reference to a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://hca.gilead.org.il/red_shoe.html">The Red Shoes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, which is a semi-common reference in Japanese culture. The titular shoes are cursed and force the wearer to continue dancing forever, and cannot be removed — the dancer only stops dancing once she has a friendly knight chop off her feet — and the shoes, with the rotting feet, go dancing off into the wilderness on their own.</span>
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> when the Crests are destroyed by the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, the kids need to figure out that the traits which powered their Digimon were part of them all along and they didn't need the Crests in the first place.
</li><li> Pretty much the most awesome example ever: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, for the Luffy vs. Foxy duel, Usopp hands Luffy a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro">giant afro</a></em> to give him strength... and then the entire crowd goes wild when he appears sporting it. And when he starts to show his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve">Heroic Resolve</a>, it is apparently because "THE AFRO POWER MADE HIM GO BERSERK!". In short, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather">Magic Feather</a> that <em>everybody</em> (except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Nami</a>, but <em>including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Robin</a></em>) believe. Even more confusing is that he effectively wins <em>because</em> of the afro! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not because it is special, but just because it happens to catch a shard of a mirror that Luffy pulls out later.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GAGeijutsukaArtDesignClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GAGeijutsukaArtDesignClass">GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class</a></em>, innocent protagonist Kisaragi was conned into buying what she believed was "God's pencil" from an old lady at a stationary store. Using the pencil on her exams did help her get into the school, but that may have been more due to her practising like hell (enough to completely use up <em>20</em> of them) the day before. Either way she was still conned into buying old excess stock. Even after this fact is revealed, she still buys them, at least for sentimental value (since the granny died).
</li><li> The stuffed penguin used by Nodoka in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki">Saki</a></em> is obviously nothing but a psychological crutch to help her focus on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong">Mahjong</a> playing.
</li><li> It's revealed towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> that the head maid of the Sohma household tried to do this for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akito</span> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her father died</span>. She <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gave Akito a box</span> and said that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">it held her father's soul</a></span>. She only did it to console her (since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akito was extremely close to her father</span>), figuring that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akito</span> would eventually "grow up" and realize that the whole idea was silly. Instead, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akito</span> clings to it for a decade, even if it's only because she <em>hopes</em> it's true; considering that she grew up surrounded by people who are possessed by Zodiac spirits, it wouldn't be that big of a stretch for her to believe in something like that, anyway. It turns into a regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macguffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macguffin">Macguffin</a> before the maid finally comes out and tells the truth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">She doesn't take it</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">too well</a>.
</li><li> The lucky crystal necklace Chieri uses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheCherryProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheCherryProject">The Cherry Project</a></em> turns out to be this.
</li><li> Luke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonColleKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonColleKnights">Mon Colle Knights</a></em> once went to find an axe of bravery that would remedy his shyness around his crush. He found it and got his courage during a desperate moment, then lost it the moment the crisis was over and he learned the axe was fake, and he returned to bumbling. In the end, he instead gets over his shyness by confessing, which required a crisis as big as the world ending.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, the Sacred Water in Karin's Tower that Goku wants to drink supposedly gives one super strength, but when Taopaipai goes for it, Karin reveals that it's just regular tap water, and it was just Goku's exertion in climbing the tower and fighting Karin for the jug that made him stronger. He purposefully gives Tao the jug without any hassle <em>and</em> gives him a dark Nimbus for the trip down so that he doesn't become any stronger.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Later on, he reveals that there really <em>is</em> a magic water.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelsInTheOutfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelsInTheOutfield">Angels in the Outfield</a></em>: Both versions of the film have a Downplayed version of the trope as for most of their stories there really <em>was</em> divine intervention earlier in the season — it just wasn't there in the final games of the season.
<ul><li> The original film had the angels who were providing supernatural help in baseball games throughout the season quit because Duffy's angry outburst violates the terms of the agreement. They reveal that they had gradually been helping less as the team's morale improved, so they should be okay on their own in the playoffs.
</li><li> The 1994 remake has a couple of instances of the angels (the heavenly beings) not helping the Angels (the professional baseball team):
<ul><li> During the quick-cut montage of games showcasing the Angels' miraculous comeback from last place in the league all the way up to the top of the standings after the All-Star break, there is one instance of a game against the Yankees where George Knox (the Angels' bench manager), after seeing another outstanding defensive play, excitedly waves his arms to indicate the "angels are here" sign, only to turn and see Roger (the only one who can actually see said angels) just shake his head to say "no, there weren't angels there". Knox gives an understandably shocked, "No?!" of disbelief.
</li><li> The last game of the season against the White Sox which would decide the American League pennant because of a celestial rule — only Roger and Knox know this, though. The Angels' starting pitcher Mel Clark has been pitching the whole game and, with the Angels up 3-2 but the White Sox having the bases loaded and their massive slugger at the plate with a full count, is clearly exhausted after throwing around 200 pitches<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11i2u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11i2u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11i2u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this is already an incredibly high pitch count by early-1990's standards; with the modern-day sabermetrics emphasis on not overworking pitchers' arms throughout his career a pitcher reaching even half of that in a game almost never happens now</span>. Knox comes out to talk to Clark and has Roger give the arm-flapping gesture he used throughout the season to signal Knox of an angel's presence. Soon, his friend JP, the rest of the Angels' team, and the whole home crowd start doing the same, convincing Clark to give it one more go. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He does and gets the White Sox batter to line out to him on a diving catch for the final out, and the Angels win the pennant. It isn't until the team is in the middle of celebrating on the field that Knox tells Clark the truth — there was no angel that time, Knox having told Roger before coming onto the field to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotivationalLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotivationalLie">give a false "angel" signal</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> During the climactic battle between Dark Helmet and Lone Starr in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a></em>, Helmet manages to steal Lone Starr's magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyNames">Schwartz</a> ring and throw it down a vent.

It's more than that, when Leroy discovers that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the master Sum Dum Goy doesn't even <em>exist,</em> and that The Master he's been searching for is Leroy himself.</span>
</li><li> Jack Putter (played by Martin Short) in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Innerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Innerspace">Innerspace</a></em> believes that Tuck Pendleton (who has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot">shrunk and is inside Putter's body</a> — long story) can increase the power of his muscles during a confrontation with an evil henchman. He can't, but that doesn't stop Jack kicking his ass.
</li><li> Slight variation in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hitch">Hitch</a></em>, where the title character eventually comes to realize that he himself is a Magic Feather — he gave clients advice on how to woo their dream girls, and his success rate is very high, but ultimately his advice didn't matter and the ladies all fell for the guys because of things they did naturally, in some cases completely contrary to Hitch's advice. All Hitch really gave them was the confidence to make the first move by believing that with Hitch's help, they actually had a chance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PootieTang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PootieTang">Pootie Tang</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pootie's magical belt is eventually revealed to be a completely non-magical item purchased from a Piggly Wiggly for 95 cents.</span>

Aside from his erectile dysfunction, he also believes he cannot defeat Dr. Evil without it. However, in the end, he saves the world, defeats Dr. Evil, and wins Felicity's love without his mojo. In the end credits, Austin is confirmed to have his mojo back when he sees his past self shagging Felicity.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldLloyd">Harold Lloyd</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GrandmasBoy1922" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GrandmasBoy1922">Grandma's Boy (1922)</a></em>, his grandmother gives him an artifact of great power (complete with a flashback of his grandfather using it to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> during the Civil War). Using the artifact, he single handedly captures the big scary guy who had been terrorizing the town. Then his grandmother reveals that it was actually the handle off her umbrella.
</li><li> Played with at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenaciousDInThePickOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenaciousDInThePickOfDestiny">Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny</a></em>, when the club owner gives his "the Devil is in all of us" speech, convincing Kage and JB not to worry about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the pick breaking. Of course, immediately after we discover the club owner is actually Satan, and just wanted the pick to complete himself.</span>
</li><li> Used on a large scale in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingdomOfHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingdomOfHeaven">Kingdom of Heaven</a></em>, where, in response to the Patriarch of Jerusalem asking him how he plans on defending the city with no knights, Balian of Ibilin immediately knights every peasant and commoner within the sound of his voice.
<div class="indent"><strong>Patriarch of Jerusalem:</strong> <em>[almost crying]</em> Who do you think you are? Will you alter the world? Does making a man a knight make him a better fighter? <br/><strong>Balian of Ibelin:</strong> <em>[looks around him and notes the newly determined faces on the brand new knights]</em> Yes.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLuckOfTheIrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLuckOfTheIrish">The Luck of the Irish</a></em>, the protagonist's grandfather (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a leprechaun</span>) is watching the protagonist and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenBlackFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenBlackFriend">Token Black Friend</a> play basketball against an evil leprechaun. A large part of the plot involves the protagonist losing his lucky coin (stolen by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>), with his family suffering bad luck since then. At the game, the grandfather sees that their team is losing and throws his grandson's friend a coin, claiming it's lucky. The guy's game immediately improves. The protagonist confronts his grandfather, as he knows the coin is fake. The grandfather invokes this trope, causing the protagonist to realize that he can make his own luck without relying on some coin. Subverted in that the stolen coin is really magical (part of its powers include maintaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a>), as, before, Ryan's life was a chain of good luck, and he never had to work for anything (e.g. his basketball plays are full of Hail Marys, and his good grades are a result of him guessing on tests).
</li><li> Inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em> movie where Gadget requires a computer chip in order for his cyborg body to function. However, after the chip is taken out and smashed by Claw, it turns out that he can still operate without it.
</li><li> Jax's enhanced arms prove to be this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a></em>, and Sonya even tells him straight out that he has a confidence problem. Only by regaining his confidence and ditching the arms is he able to defeat Motaro and help Sonya against the others in the final battle.
</li><li> Played dangerously straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Crash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Crash">Crash</a></em> when a character gives his daughter (who is afraid of bullets after a stray one found its way through her bedroom window) an "impenetrable cloak given to him by a fairy". She believes it so much that she runs into his arms to shield him from a man who has him at gunpoint. But <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in an ironic and heart-touching parallel placebo-effect situation, the shooter's daughter has loaded the gun with blanks (she was afraid he'd accidentally shoot himself).</span>
</li><li> A similarly depressing version can be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodDiamond">Blood Diamond</a></em>, as Dia's identity as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldier</a>, "See-Me-No-More", is tied up in a cap given to him by Captain Poison after getting promoted. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The cap getting knocked off in the climax causes him to revert for a short time, until he sees someone killed in front of him.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TetsuoTheIronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TetsuoTheIronMan">Tetsuo II: Body Hammer</a></em>, the protagonist's transformation into a metal monster is shown to have been caused by an injection with a serum. It's later revealed that an object in his pocket prevented the serum from being injected into him. His transformation was caused by his own anger.
</li><li> Spider-Man uses this trick to save a kid in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em>. He needs the kid to climb up out of a burning car so he can get him to safety, but the kid is too scared. So Spidey unmasks and gives it to the kid, claiming it will "make him strong". It works.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMansChest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMansChest">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a></em>, Tia Dalma gives Jack an artifact after learning that the Kraken is after him. It is heavily implied that this jar of dirt does absolutely nothing, and is just a placebo for Jack to feel safer.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jack:</strong> Is the jar of dirt going to... help? <br/><strong>Tia Dalma:</strong> If you don't want it, give it back. <br/><strong>Jack:</strong> No! <em>[clutches the jar tighter]</em> <br/><strong>Tia Dalma:</strong> Then it helps.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaysOfThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DaysOfThunder">Days of Thunder</a></em>, Cole is angry after a fouled pit stop places him in poor track position. Harry tells him that during that stop they put perfectly matched and balanced tires on his race car and that it will help him overtake the leader. Cole wins the race. Then during the post-race interview Harry admits that there wasn't anything different about the tires, but he had to tell Cole something to get him to calm down and focus on driving.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BullDurham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BullDurham">Bull Durham</a></em>, there's Annie encouraging Nuke to wear garters to help him play better. Discussed by Crash later in the movie:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Crash:</strong> If you think you're winning because you're getting laid, or because you're not getting laid, or because you're wearing women's underwear, <em>then you are!</em>
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass">X-Men: First Class</a></em>, the chest blaster device helps Havok control his energy blasts, but eventually it gets damaged. He eventually gains enough control over it to aim his uncontrolled blasts effectively, clipping Angel's wings with them.
</li><li> Happens in the film <em>Uchenik Lekarya</em> (<em>The Doctor's Apprentice</em>) and the Bulgarian fairytale it was based on. The hero pretends to be deaf and mute in order to get hired as a servant by a doctor who refuses to take on pupils (he wants to become a doctor to heal the mother of the girl he loves). He is forced to speak when his master is about to make a medical mistake that could kill the King's bride <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(who happens to be the hero's beloved)</span>. The furious doctor demands that the King execute his servant. The hero offers a duel instead: the doctor may give him any poison he wants. If he survives, he can give the doctor a poison of his own. Having somehow survived, the hero comes to the palace the next day and pours a cup of something for the doctor, who drinks it and promptly dies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The cup contained pure water, since the young man didn't want his teacher to die. The doctor died because he thought it was a poison he couldn't identify and because he couldn't bear the thought of someone besting him. The poison (his own hatred and jealousy) was inside him all along.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em>, Thor's trusty hammer Mjölnir is destroyed. Eventually, he learns from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Odin's spirit</span> that while the hammer is indeed a mighty weapon, it was not the source of his lightning powers. It came from within him, and the hammer was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> to help him focus his powers.

However, late in the story it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> half the rules are ones he had made up himself and forgotten, and have no real impact on his magic except that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect">thought they did</a></span>.

The healer Malcolm sends her a '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMeteor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMeteor">stellatite</a>' stone, along with instructions for using it to defeat the hypnosis, and she manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedTheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedTheMole">trick him</a>. When she goes to give it back to Malcolm, he revealed that it was an ordinary rock all along.
</li><li> Played straight in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em>, wherein Harry tricks Ron Weasley into thinking that he (Harry) has just poured some "Felix Felicis" luck potion into Ron's drink to improve his Quidditch game (which had been suffering due to an extreme case of nerves). Hermione saw Harry do it, and warned Ron not to drink it, as it would be cheating to use a potion in a Quiddich game. Ron drinks it anyway, and his game improves hugely. Then, when Hermione confronts Harry again afterward (once Gryffindor has won with over 200 points), Harry shows both of them that he hadn't poured a drop—in fact, the bottle was still sealed. Ron mocks Hermione for saying it was the reason he played well, who tries to compliment Ron/backpedal, but fails. This leaves them even more pissed off with each other than before, to Harry's chagrin (he was counting on Ron's victory snapping him out of his touchy mood and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">friends with Hermione again</a>, instead it gets him Lavender as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girlfriend</a>).

In a crisis, he often reflects on how fortunate it is that he can't feel fear, because he should be terrified at that moment. The talisman eventually gets broken and replaced with a regular stone, but it continues to work until he realizes the replacement.

She thinks that it somes from a "don't-notice-me" charm she once purchased from a street vendor, but when High Mage Quick Ben takes a good look at the stone in question, he claims that it's just junk. Turns out Blend just has an innate talent that was brought out by her intense belief in the stone's potency.

He was quickly able to shed his fear and became remarkably efficient at slaying dragons, but also cocky. After a night of heavy drinking, he faced his fiftieth dragon, and couldn't remember the word when the time came to use it, but was still able to kill the dragon, much to his confusion. When he was told by his headmaster that the word was just a placebo, he fell back into his old nervous ways, and died trying to kill his fifty-first dragon.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> book <em>The Blob That Ate Everything</em>, Zackie thought that his reality altering powers came from a magical typewriter, only to find when he couldn't get the typewriter to work they were actually within himself.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">film version</a> provides a variation in that the Wizard instead gives Dorothy's friends various symbols of what they've achieved—a diploma that signifies the Scarecrow getting his brain, a ticking heart watch that reflects the Tin Man's kindness, and a war medal that testifies to the Cowardly Lion's courage.
</li><li> And of course, Dorothy had the slippers to get home the ENTIRE time. To invert the previous examples though, the wizard offered her... a ride home.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal">Twisted Metal</a></em> games occasionally put a dark twist on this trope.
<ul><li> In the first game, the driver of Yellow Jacket, Charlie Kane, entered the Twisted Metal contest in the hopes of finding his long-lost son. Upon winning the contest, Calypso simply informs him that his son, Needles Kane, was the driver of Sweet Tooth in the contest — meaning that he had already run across the person he was looking for, and <em>killed him</em> along the way. A despondent Charlie thinks about re-entering the competition next year so that Calypso can take away his suffering.
</li><li> In <em>Twisted Metal: Black</em>, the driver of Brimstone, a preacher who's suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a> ever since a failed exorcism that resulted in his congregation getting killed, enters the contest hoping that Calypso can exorcise the demon. Calypso grants his wish... by revealing that there was no demon at all. The preacher was just insane, and <em>he</em> had killed his congregation, so Calypso couldn't do anything to help him. The preacher kills himself once he realizes that he can't run away from his sin.

This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">Zig-Zagged</a>, however, due to the fact that the tightening of the bracelet itself acts as a cue to begin intentionally using the ability. Without it, the increased tension in the body would be much harder to notice, and thus it would be far more difficult for Apollo to know when to begin using the ability in earnest. This gives the bracelet more importance than the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather">Magic Feather</a>, even after the above is revealed.

At the recital, she does dance well, but the tremendous applause causes her to do things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallRun">Wall Run</a> and even outdance her teacher. After the recital:

</div><ul><li> In the episode "Whisky Business", Moe gets a new suit, which causes others to treat him better and directly leads to his whiskey going public. When he loses the suit, Marge tells him the magic was inside him all along, even referencing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo">Dumbo</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> itself.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> subverts this trope. Mordecai and Rigby, trying to form a rock band, are visited by their future selves who promise to make them successful. Their future selves teach their present selves about dancing and fashion, but neglect to teach them how to actually play their instruments. Right before it's time for the present M&amp;R to play their first gig, the future M&amp;R show up with magic guitar picks, and miraculously, the gig begins successfully. In the middle of the song, however, present Mordecai realizes that, while it wasn't the magic guitar picks, it wasn't their natural talent either; the microphones and electric guitars were unplugged, and the pre-recorded song was playing in the background.
</li><li> An interesting subversion occurs in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>, in which the titular heroine uses an intelligent driving computer to pass a driving test. When something goes wrong, the computer can't control the car anymore, and Kim needs to drive the car she and Ron are in out of the villain's lair, she protests she can't drive, and the computer tells her that it never did anything - it was her all along. Kim, inspired, drives the car out of the collapsing lair, whereupon the computer tells her it lied - the computer had been doing the driving before, but needed to inspire her.
<ul><li> Done a second time when Kim feels like she's lost her mojo when her signature costume gets shredded and is discontinued. However it was subverted in that it was less those specific clothes as having a distinct set of mission clothes, and with the help of some criminal fashion designers she's soon back to her ass-kicking ways.

After Adam is taken hostage by Skeletor, leaving only Orko and Cringer able to get his sword to him, Cringer seems the best one to try (seeing that, if he manages, he would have the best benefit, being able to become Battle-Cat when Adam turns into He-Man. In order to get the well-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward">Lovable Coward</a> to even try, Orko gives him a supposed magical amulet that he claims gives the wearer bravery, and it actually works, letting Cringer even get past a ghost in a dark part of the dungeons of Snake Mountain. At the end of the story, after Cringer's mission succeeds, he finds he lost the amulet, but Orko tells him it was just a piece of junk anyway.
</li><li> Used in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats1985">ThunderCats (1985)</a></em>, when the mind-controlling villain Alluro acquires an amulet in a box that is supposed to ramp up powers. He then proceeds to easily mesmerize all the heroes except for Snarf, who manages to get the box away from him, and then defeat him, even using the powers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Sword of Omens</a>, which had previously only activated for its proper wielder. At the end, naturally, Snarf realizes he never bothered to open the box to see what the amulet looked like, and when he <em>does</em> open it, it's revealed that the amulet inside has been broken for some time. Probably a good thing nobody told the bad guy.

The blacksmith explains that the duelist's sword took years to be forged and the new one took just a few hours, so Lion-O had it in himself to defeat the Duelist the whole time.
</li><li> Used several times in episodes of the children's animation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales">Dragon Tales</a></em>.

</li><li> In a slight variation on the trope, Ord is afraid of a thunder storm until given a cape, which he uses to pretend he's a super hero, causing him to no longer be afraid of the thunder.
</li><li> In another slight variation of this trope, Cassie goes to the wishing well to wish for a talent for the talent show. In order to convince the jaded wishing well to help, Cassie helps the wishing well and promises to be her friend. Then Cassie realizes that she already has a talent; helping people. A bit Anvilicious, but still cute.

Not only do Bear's basketball skills improve, but other lucky things happen to him and he think it's all due to the clover, not knowing that it's really just a regular clover with an extra leaf taped to it. As Bear's luck starts to go to his head, he starts making risky moves and Franklin decides he has to tell him the truth. As soon as he does, Bear experiences a crippling lack of confidence, until Franklin reminds him that it wasn't really a real clover, so all of his luck was his own.
</li><li> In a first season story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em>, Arthur believes that he has a "lucky pencil" that helps him do well on tests. He seems to realize eventually that he did well because he studied, though that doesn't stop him from whining loudly when D.W. tries to claim the pencil for her own. The story of the pencil became the basis for a song on the original <em>Arthur</em> music album, <em>Arthur And Friends: The First Almost Real Not Live CD</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shelldon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shelldon">Shelldon</a></em>
<ul><li> An episode featured a series of flashbacks showing Mayor Yoko giving members of the community trinkets that he claimed were magic, but were really just Magic Feathers. When the community was threatened by an impending catastrophe, Shelldon and his friends traveled to his office to try to get some of his magic, and discovered the truth.
</li><li> So nice, it was used twice. In "Magic Mojo," Shelldon becomes the mascot of the school finball team and comes to believe his mascot costume is magic after he ends up being subbed into the team and scores a game-winning goal. When the costume ends up getting shrunk in the wash, he despairs. He ends up seeking help from Doctor Shell, but when he doesn't believe Doctor Shell's advice that the mojo comes from him, Doctor Shell gives him what he claims to be a powerful mojo charm. After winning the big game, Shelldon returns it to him and he <em>eats</em> it. It turns out it was a peanut butter candy.

She promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">loses her mind</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks">Storm Hawks</a></em> plays with this concept using Junko's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Knuckle Busters</a>, which were given to him when he was younger by his aunt to make him stronger.

However, the episode shows that one would build up muscle using them anyways, anyway (since the item in question is really heavy) and that they stop your wrists from hurting after punching metal, meaning they were always meant to be a <em>complement</em> to his natural strength rather than the source like he imagined.
</li><li> A unique version was used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuzzLightyearOfStarCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuzzLightyearOfStarCommand">Buzz Lightyear of Star Command</a></em> when XR's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Black Sheep</a> brother XL attacked him and stole a component from him called an AFD, which was the only difference between them he could find in their schematics.

Overhearing this, Red Guy started hurting the other kids under the belief no superhero would stop him. Chicken then recovered the blanket and tried to use it on himself and become "Wonder Wattle" but Red easily defeated him.

He believes that he can't be useful without it, and Shankar has to do his work for him. Near the end of the episode, when Noor Jehan can't stop due to her brakes being jammed and is heading towards Shankar, Rajiv pushes Shankar out of the way just in time, which gets him to realize that he can still be useful without his crown.
</li></ul></li><li> A story arc with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomTerrific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomTerrific">Tom Terrific</a></em> has Tom helping a ragtag bunch of little kids compete in a series of athletic events against a team of bullies. Tom kits the kids out with plain tennis shoes but tells them that they're magic shoes that will help them win. The confidence boost soon kicks in as the kids defeat the bullies. Tom lets on that the shoes were just regular shoes afterwards,
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies2018">Muppet Babies (2018)</a></em> episode, "No Laughing Matter", when Fozzie loses his Great-Uncle Schnozzie's lucky joke book, he thinks he can't be funny without it. The other babies get Bunsen and Beaker to make a new lucky joke book for Fozzie, and when Fozzie sees that Rizzo borrowed the real lucky joke book, he realizes that he doesn't need it, as he still performed his funny joke show without it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries">Tangled: The Series</a></em> episode "Curses!", Rapunzel angers a gypsy by refusing to give up the telescope given to her by her father. The gypsy then declares that Rapunzel will be cursed with misfortune. After experincing all kinds of bad luck, Rapunzel is about to give up her telescope to end the curse until Eugene gives her a moose tooth that is supposed to be a good luck charm to counteract the curse. After this, Rapunzel then gains the confidence to cross a dangerous ravine. But halfway through, the tooth is revealed to have come from Shorty's mouth, and she starts to worry that the curse will prevent them from getting to safety, until Eugene tells her that luck only exists if you believe in it.
