</p><p>Heaven forbid, then, that said actor should be found engaging in perfectly legal, perfectly normal adult activities like drinking alcohol and/or having sex. And should said actor take a role in a production where they'll do things like nude scenes, using foul language and/or engaging in criminal behavior, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> will arise against that actor for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">betraying their expectations</a> or somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren">corrupting their young audience</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> got a lot of heat for this in her early stardom on account of her very sexual image and her fanbase being largely tween and teen girls. Her very first video was quite provocative with her and the backup dancers dancing in scantily clad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatholicSchoolgirlsRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatholicSchoolgirlsRule">Catholic schoolgirl uniforms</a>, and she posed for a sexually suggestive photo shoot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RollingStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RollingStone">Rolling Stone</a></em> magazine. She only got racier from there. While it died down, it still pops up occasionally, such as with her hit single, "If U Seek Amy" (say it slowly), enraging parents as they heard their tween daughters walking around the house singing F-U-C-K Me.
</li><li> Mostly averted by Britney's classic rival and fellow <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub">The Mickey Mouse Club</a></em> alum <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera">Christina Aguilera</a>, whose early material was always a little suggestive, making her later, more sexually-mature stuff easier to accept. She still took heat for it though on account of her being very popular with teen and tween girls. <em>The Jenny Jones Show</em> actually did an episode in 2003 about young girls who were imitating her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneHathaway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneHathaway">Anne Hathaway</a> was the target of an explosion of controversy when she appeared topless in the movie <em>Havoc</em>. Her previous roles: both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessDiaries">Princess Diaries</a></em> movies and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EllaEnchanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EllaEnchanted">Ella Enchanted</a></em>. Since then, she's successfully graduated into doing more adult roles with no further controversy, including playing a recovering heroin addict in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RachelGettingMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RachelGettingMarried">Rachel Getting Married</a></em> and starring in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveAndOtherDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveAndOtherDrugs">Love and Other Drugs</a></em>, which features several extended nude scenes.
</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, who owes her career to her early Disney films even more than Hathaway does. Before Lindsay was cast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em>, it was written to be a racy R-rated affair with (to quote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey">Tina Fey</a>) "wall to wall titties". As she was considered a family-friendly actress, it was changed to PG-13 and much of the racier content was cut. Lindsay also turned down an offer to pose for <em>Playboy</em> as she had a Disney film coming out and tried not to dress too skimpily in public out of fear of upsetting her younger fans. And it's precisely for this reason that her party girl antics and drug abuse was such big news.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>:
<ul><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em> was at the center of this almost from the start of her career. From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotPornItsArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotPornItsArt">"art shots"</a> taken when she was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBait">fifteen years old</a>, to leaked phone pics of her in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySoakedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySoakedShirt">wet T-shirt</a>, to a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tmz.com/2010/05/11/miley-cyrus-dirty-dancing-adam-shankman-movie-wrap-party-grind-so-you-think-you-can-dance">video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of her grinding on the (gay) producer of her film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastSong">The Last Song</a></em> when she was sixteen, to her scantily-clad performance of her song "Party in the USA" at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards (where she danced on a pole at one point), there was always a clash between her squeaky-clean Disney image and her real personality. She was forced to appear as Hannah Montana, complete with blonde wig and sparkly clothes - a far cry from her real persona.
</li><li> Eventually, she fully abandoned this trope and embraced her growing "bad girl" image. While her 2010 album <em>Can't Be Tamed</em> was a start, the true turning point was in 2013 when she cut her hair short and released the album <em>Bangerz</em>, which was heavily influenced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synthpop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synthpop">synthpop</a> and "Dirty South" hip-hop. Her videos for "We Can't Stop" and "Wrecking Ball" created mountains of controversy due to their sexuality and drug references, to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows">Todd in the Shadows</a> all but <a class="urllink" href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/tis/tpsr/40235-pop-song-reviews-qwe-cant-stopq-vs-qcome-a-get-itq">called for an intervention<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for her. Meanwhile, her <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZrHTUD7AVM">highly sexualized, tongue-wagging performance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at the 2013 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> Video Music Awards earned both outcry and mockery, quickly going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a> due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a> and bizarre imagery — even getting one of her self-professed idols to <a class="urllink" href="http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/10/02/sinead-oconnor-miley-cyrus-open-letter/">ask her to stop<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. There's no doubt that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">this is exactly what she wanted</a>, as her new image sent her from a washed-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar">Former</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol">Teen Idol</a> in the making<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0051p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0051p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0051p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Her acting career had pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarDerailingRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarDerailingRole">self-destructed</a> by this point, thanks to the one-two punch of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoUndercover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoUndercover">So Undercover</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake">American remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LOL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LOL">LOL</a></em> in 2012.</span> to one of the biggest pop stars in the world virtually overnight. She's lampshaded the change a little, saying that, under Disney, she was expected to act like an adult, and now, <em>as</em> an adult, she acts like a child. She also satirized this trope in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror">Black Mirror</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorRachelJackAndAshleyToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorRachelJackAndAshleyToo">"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"</a>, where she played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">a teen pop singer whose public image is ruthlessly controlled</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">her aunt</a>.

She keeps a low profile in the press, doesn't publicly party, drink, or go out without underwear, and keeps mostly to family-friendly roles like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ACinderellaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ACinderellaStory">A Cinderella Story</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaiseYourVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaiseYourVoice">Raise Your Voice</a></em> (saying she turned down a lot of darker roles that would upset her teen fanbase). There were some minor controversies involving her relationship with 10-years-her-senior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GoodCharlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GoodCharlotte">Joel Madden</a>, and her roles on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>, where her character was involved in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWaySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWaySex">ménage à trois</a></em> with Dan and Vanessa, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarInc">War, Inc.</a>.</em>, where she played a spoiled, slutty foreign pop star who gets the main character's attention by <em>putting a live scorpion down her pants</em>. Of course, it helped her image that, in the former case, most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>' ire was aimed at the show's writers and at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW">The CW</a> rather than at Hilary, and in the latter, that her character was a tragic <em>parody</em> of young, oversexed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">idol singers</a>, complete with a pimp who planned on having her "star" in a porn movie. In any case, all of these blew over very quickly and failed to tarnish her squeaky-clean image, so it's clear she's overall succeeded in averting this. It also helps that she married a hockey player (generally the least scandal-prone of the major sports leagues) and had her first baby, <em>within</em> wedlock, with him, at the relatively young but perfectly reasonable age of 23. She lampshaded it in an interview on <em>Chelsea Lately</em>, when they talked about how she got pregnant.
<div class="indent"> "Everybody thinks I'm a good girl, but I figured it out."
</div></li><li> It's rumoured that the reason Lalaine got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> from <em>Lizzie McGuire</em> partly because of her drug habit. Lalaine later said that she had wanted to pursue a music career, and the drugs came later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacEfron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacEfron">Zac Efron</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanessaHudgens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanessaHudgens">Vanessa Hudgens</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical">High School Musical</a></em>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceOnTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceOnTheSet">dated in real life</a>, caught a bit of flak for such terrible things as making out on the beach and letting it be known that they were *gasp* doing things of a more intimate nature. A camera catching a condom falling out of Efron's pocket as he walked the red carpet led to a short-lived outcry. Seeing as how they were pretty much a perfectly-normal couple in their mid-twenties, it was all a little ridiculous. They have both politely but firmly explained this. Repeatedly. Given the fact they remained a steady couple for over three years despite being barely out of their teens, stayed together right at the height of their media frenzy rather than taking advantage of their new fame, were obviously practicing safe sex (see the alleged condom), guarded their private relationship fiercely and even post-breakup were genuinely amicable and never used the paparazzi to turn on each other, you'd think parents might see them as <em>good</em> example for teens (especially as they came off as more mature than a lot of Hollywood relationships), but apparently they had to be as squeaky clean as their high school counterparts.
<ul><li> Hudgens' multiple nude photo scandals, however, are a far straighter example. On top of the usual outcry about a kid-friendly actress posing naked, there were also concerns about Vanessa's age when she took the pictures — while she's in her early twenties now, she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBait">about 17 or 18</a> when the first <em>High School Musical</em> film came out, which is also around when some of the photos (at least the first batch of them) are believed to have been made. Of course, the fact that the photos weren't made for public consumption is pretty much lost on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>. In addition, the leaks of said photos probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">helped Hudgens break out of her Disney type casting</a> more easily than her <em>High School Musical</em> co-stars — she's since taken roles in films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch">Sucker Punch</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpringBreakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpringBreakers">Spring Breakers</a></em> and the role of Mimi in a Hollywood Bowl production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RENT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RENT">RENT</a></em>, all of which have her dressed in provocative outfits (and in the case of <em>Spring Breakers</em>, doing nude scenes), and she's done several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExposure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExposure">sexy photo shoots</a> for fitness and fashion magazines. However she has declined offers to do nudity in films and says that the response to that is "but you've already done it" (as apparently pictures intended to be private are equivalent to a film that will be seen by the general public).
</li><li> Efron, too, has had troubles with this. He became known as a party animal after the <em>High School Musical</em> series wrapped up, with multiple short-lived stints in rehab, to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeaMichele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeaMichele">Lea Michele</a> (whose boyfriend and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> co-star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoryMonteith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoryMonteith">Cory Monteith</a> died of a heroin/alcohol overdose) <a class="urllink" href="http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/04/09/lea-michele-zac-efron-seek-help-drugs-cory-monteith-death/">begged him<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to give it up. Like Hudgens, he too has embraced his "bad boy" image, playing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyFratboyHijinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyFratboyHijinx">drunken frat boy</a> villain in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Neighbors2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Neighbors2014">Neighbors</a></em>. Although not so much purity, Efron was also asked by Disney to downplay some of his hobbies to the public, like playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, reading Manga (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a>), and generally being something of a nerd.
</li></ul></li><li> Alexa (Pena)Vega began her career with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyKids">Spy Kids</a></em> films and light fare like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sleepover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sleepover">Sleepover</a></em>, but quickly switched to darker roles such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RepoTheGeneticOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RepoTheGeneticOpera">Repo! The Genetic Opera</a></em> (where her character is fittingly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocenceLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocenceLost">Innocence Lost</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a>). She's also gone memetic for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> turn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MacheteKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MacheteKills">Machete Kills</a></em> and a cameo as a stripper in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SinCityADameToKillFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SinCityADameToKillFor">Sin City: A Dame to Kill For</a></em>. Ironically both of the latter two projects were by the man that directed her in <em>Spy Kids</em> - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRodriguez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRodriguez">Robert Rodriguez</a>. According to Alexa, she had to fight to be considered for those roles. Upon being turned down for being "just a kid", she responded that she was twenty-four and she was given the part.
</li><li> Sara Paxton exploited this when she was cast in the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastHouseOnTheLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastHouseOnTheLeft">The Last House on the Left</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that they wanted an actress with this, to prevent people from finding the eventual rape scene sexy. Ironically beforehand Paxton had starred in a family-friendly film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquamarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquamarine">Aquamarine</a></em> playing a mermaid <em>without</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeashellBra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeashellBra">Seashell Bra</a> - complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodivaHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodivaHair">Godiva Hair</a> and two implied nude scenes.
</li><li> Kiely Williams might have harpooned her career with this. Starting out in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Group</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeLW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeLW">3LW</a> (which got their start during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">sugary sweet</a> bubblegum pop era of the early 2000s) and then moving on to being in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCheetahGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCheetahGirls">The Cheetah Girls</a>, she was one of Disney's poster children for a while. Then she does a little video called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J96ujGstSUw">"Spectacular"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. To sum up the song, the girl goes out, gets really drunk (it's not hard to imagine she was possibly drugged), and has anonymous sex with a random guy. She can't remember his name, but she doesn't really care "because the sex was spectacular." Kiely tried to backpedal on this by saying it was supposed to encourage women to avoid these situations, but when it's really easy to turn the song's lyrics into essentially "I enjoyed getting date-raped," it didn't work.
</li><li> Adrienne Bailon has also been an enjoyable train wreck to watch since the Cheetah Girls group and movies ended. She hung around the Kardashians for a few years, and eventually staged a fake nude photo controversy cooked up by Bailon and a gossip blogger in an attempt to boost her career. Said controversy caused the group to back out of a planned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MacysThanksgivingDayParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MacysThanksgivingDayParade">Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> performance (to be replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MirandaCosgrove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MirandaCosgrove">Miranda Cosgrove</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickAstley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickAstley">Rick Astley</a>), and the breakup of the group not long after.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendaSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendaSong">Brenda Song</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody">The Suite Life of Zack and Cody</a></em> appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork">The Social Network</a></em>, where her character has a quickie with Andrew Garfield's character in a bathroom stall in an early scene (though no nudity is seen — it <em>is</em> a PG-13 movie, even with all the swearing). In other scenes, she is seen drinking and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">setting a scarf on fire over a Facebook relationship status</a>. However, her role in the film didn't garner any controversy, and she still appeared on <em>Suite Life On Deck</em> up to that show's finale in 2011. Rumors once circulated that she was pregnant with Trace Cyrus' baby. The two got engaged around the same time. Months later, she stated that she had never been pregnant and the engagement was called off. Many speculate that she miscarried. However, since she was no longer on Disney at this point, there wasn't much backlash, to begin with.
</li><li> <em>Suite Life</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical">High School Musical</a></em> alum <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale">Ashley Tisdale</a> posed nude (no frontal) for <em>Allure</em>. The 26-year-old Tisdale is of age (obviously), and even made it a point to say in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IReadItForTheArticles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IReadItForTheArticles">the article</a> that she's "...not the young girl everyone thinks I am; I'm actually a woman." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> doesn't seem to care about the shoot, though, since she still has a starring voice role as Candace on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>, and has reprised her role as Sharpay in a Disney Channel spinoff movie. Alongside this she also did voice work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> and played an escort in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a></em>, and it didn't stop her from doing more work with Disney.
</li><li> This happened back in the sixties to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayleyMills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayleyMills">Hayley Mills</a> (star of the 1960 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pollyanna1960" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pollyanna1960">Pollyanna</a></em> film and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheParentTrap1961" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheParentTrap1961">The Parent Trap</a></em>) when she was considered for the titular role in the 1962 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lolita">Lolita</a></em> and Disney told her to step away from the film. In fact, her first role that attempted to shake her goody-too-shoes image was <em>The Trouble with Angels</em>, her first post-Disney role, where she played a mischevious Catholic schoolgirl. However, the only truly daring thing she actually does in <em>Angels</em> is smoking, which goes to show you how concerned Hollywood felt about shaking up Mills' image. It eventually <em>did</em> catch up with her in 1967 when she appeared in the British countercultural movie <em>The Family Way</em> (the same movie scored in part by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> as his first venture outside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>). In one scene, she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToplessnessFromTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToplessnessFromTheBack">filmed from the rear naked</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">She married the middle-aged director</a> of the film, Roy Boulting, in 1971 (though they divorced in 1975). She also appeared topless in the film <em>The Deadly Strangers</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">1960s</a> Disney teen star <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyKirk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyKirk">Tommy Kirk</a>'s career reportedly came to an end both due to the star's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">drug issues</a>, diva-like behavior on set and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">homosexuality</a>. He's since gotten sober and regrets his on-set behavior.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Orlando</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven">Brown</a>'s repeated legal problems in recent years have been a major reason while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RavensHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RavensHome">Raven's Home</a></em> has not even referenced Brown's character of Eddie Thomas, and barring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">a recast</a> it's doubtful the character will appear in the series.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoveCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoveCameron">Dove Cameron</a> is an interesting case, as before she was on Disney, she was on the <em>very</em> non-Disney show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS">Shameless (US)</a></em> playing a hyper-sexual "bad girl" (while underage, mind). However, she got cast for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivAndMaddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivAndMaddie">Liv and Maddie</a></em> at 17, and later starred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Descendants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Descendants">Descendants</a></em> and several Marvel productions (playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> and <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarvelRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarvelRising">Marvel Rising</a></em>), which gave her Disney cred. This didn't effect her career too much, as she's had no trouble starring in racier works like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BarelyLethal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BarelyLethal">Barely Lethal</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingAgainstType" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingAgainstType">Playing Against Type</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">Ruby</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Hale</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> (which, while Marvel, and as such Disney, was a much more adult-aimed production with considerably darker content), and posing in bikinis on her Instagram page. However, she <em>has</em> gotten quite a bit of harassment from trolls on social media over this. She's bitten back about this, pointing out that she isn't <em>owned</em> by Disney and is free to do whatever roles she wants.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BellaThorne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BellaThorne">Bella Thorne</a> made her debut for the Disney Channel sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShakeItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShakeItUp">Shake it Up</a></em> and later confessed that Disney had told her to speak in a higher pitched falsetto voice - to better sound like a good girl instead of her natural huskier tones. After leaving Disney, she became infamous for her sexual posts on social media - and in 2019 she even directed an X-rated erotic film!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJonasBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJonasBrothers">The Jonas Brothers</a> faced many restrictions from Disney with regards to their infamous purity rings. The lyrics to their songs were constantly being policed, and they'd often be forced to change any lines that were deemed inappropriate. This included lines about being alone in a room with another person. Additionally the brothers were told to respond to potentially risque interview questions (about drugs, alcohol, sex etc) by "playing dumb" and veering off on other topics.
</li><li> Demi Lovato got her start on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney &amp; Friends</a></em> and then worked on many Disney Channel projects - with TV films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CampRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CampRock">Camp Rock</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrincessProtectionProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrincessProtectionProgram">Princess Protection Program</a></em> and the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonnyWithAChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonnyWithAChance">Sonny with a Chance</a></em>. And she was wearing a purity ring for the public scrutiny, so unsurprisingly, she ended up getting addicted to cocaine and alcohol before she turned eighteen. In this case however, Disney publicly supported her when she went into rehab to seek treatment. Since getting clean, she's also embraced a more sexual image (which didn't stop Disney from letting her cover "Let It Go" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen (2013)</a></em>).

<ul><li> Anime Industry: Averted for the actors who worked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a>, which produces anime series that get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerised">Bowdlerised</a> for younger audiences. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewRannells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewRannells">Andrew Rannells</a> is currently starring in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon">The Book of Mormon</a></em> musical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonGriffith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonGriffith">Jason Griffith</a> did a condom commercial, and most of the others (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanGreen">Dan Green</a>) have done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">Hentai</a> (animated pornography) at some point. Also, most of the actors that work for the company have dubbed earlier titles for older audiences, either for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MediaBlasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MediaBlasters">Media Blasters</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor">Veronica Taylor</a> doing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiDeeperKyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiDeeperKyo">Samurai Deeper Kyo</a></em> comes to mind) or for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia">Central Park Media</a>.
<ul><li> Similarly in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation">Western Animation</a> world people would be surprised that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker">Frank Welker</a>, Hal Smith, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuneForay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuneForay">June Foray</a>, and Allan Melvin who worked in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> productions together once did voice work in a pornographic animated film entitled <em>Once Upon A Girl</em> in which they can be heard swearing and using sexual slang while some of their characters engage in sexual activity.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen">Tim Allen</a> toned down his stand-up after he noticed more and more families coming after he did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em> and once apologized to for starting out with F-bombs in one act. Now post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em>, he asks venues to make concessions for families coming to see him.
<ul><li> Tim also has a criminal record for transporting drugs in the 70's, even serving time in prison (he got a reduced sentence for passing on information about his supplier). Once he got out it was a sign to him he needed to get far away from that life and that's where he got into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandUpComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandUpComedy">Stand-Up Comedy</a>. When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em> was primed to air some news articles reported on his criminal history, especially since the show was supposed to be a family comedy, with Tim and the producers responding immediately with their own side of the story. Later in the shows run they were contemplating doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">an episode on drunk driving</a> (previously doing an episode on marijuana use) but Tim had gotten a DUI during the summer break and the episode was canceled due to feeling it would be hypocritical to do so.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieAndrews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieAndrews">Julie Andrews</a> got famous for playing two quintessential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNanny">Magical Nanny</a> characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em>. This gave her a squeaky-clean image that she came to resent. An attempt at getting out of it came in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarlingLili" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarlingLili">Darling Lili</a></em> where she plays a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFataleSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFataleSpy">Femme Fatale Spy</a> - who even does a <em>striptease</em> on stage! But the film flopped and she didn't see much success. She did, however, use her experiences of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> in her husband Blake Edwards's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SOB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SOB">S.O.B.</a></em> - where she plays an actress with a goody two shoes image who is convinced to appear topless in a film. But as of the 2000s, she has returned to working for Disney, albeit in a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">Adam Westing</a> manner of her earlier image.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> kept himself under this, not allowing himself to smoke or drink in public in order to set a good example to his young fans, as well as acting like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">the Doctor</a> while out and about as much as reasonable. This did help build his mythos as being <em>the</em> Doctor, but doing this for as long as he did and as constantly as he did resulted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter">serious damage to his mental health</a> and was part of the reason why later Doctors had much shorter tenures.
<ul><li> In public, Tom Baker held to the Doctor's standards, but in private, he was well known for drinking both before and during filming and being a right bloody terror to the production crew. This tendency only got worse in his later seasons, as he (rightly or wrongly) saw himself as the Doctor <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1u1tz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1u1tz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1u1tz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The definite article, you might say</span> and refused to take direction on how to play the character from anybody, be they directors or even the series producers. His problems were something of an open secret in the British media, so much younger fans could still believe the illusion of Baker being the Doctor, while older viewers more or less knew better.
</li><li> All in all, the bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s adaptation of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLivesAndLovesOfASheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLivesAndLovesOfASheDevil">The Lives And Loves Of A She Devil</a></em> was well-received, but its sex scenes featuring a naked 'Dr. Who' were considered so shocking at the time that they are what most people remember of the show - the description for it on the BBC's website mentioned 'Tom Baker's thrusting buttocks' and many contemporary comedy shows spoofed it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngridBergman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngridBergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>, anyone? She first tried to get out of her goody-two-shoes image with <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>, but it didn't work. Later on, she destroyed the image quite accidentally by leaving her husband for director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertoRossellini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertoRossellini">Roberto Rossellini</a>. The backlash was <em>massive</em>. She was even denounced on the floor of the US Senate. How many victims of this trope can say that?
</li><li> The press had a frenzied field day when Elizabeth Berkley, formerly well-known for playing a straight-laced, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie">vocally feminist</a> high schooler on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell">Saved by the Bell</a></em>, played a nude, bisexual showgirl in, well, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Showgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Showgirls">Showgirls</a></em>. The flop of that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarDerailingRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarDerailingRole">killed her career</a>, though that probably had more to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">the quality of the film itself</a> than her playing that sort of role.
</li><li> To get out of her contract on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBiel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBiel">Jessica Biel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked this trope</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExposure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExposure">posing topless</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToplessnessFromTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToplessnessFromTheBack">not frontal</a>) in <em>Gear</em> magazine. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBait">When she was just seventeen.</a> This was enough to get her character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> for a good while, returning only sparingly and practically evolving into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">The Ghost</a> with her own entirely off-screen storylines.
</li><li> While some of his earlier, lesser-known roles were not family friendly — he has played a rentboy and a thief/male prostitute among others — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrlandoBloom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrlandoBloom">Orlando Bloom</a> gained his recognition from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">Lord of the Rings</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a></em> trilogies. The latter made him a teen and tweener idol, so the publicity campaign used with him portrayed him as a safe, non-sexual kind of boy next door that the parents of his 13-year-old fans could feel good about. His attempts to play to a more mature audience while maintaining the tween-friendly image were not very successful. After the third <em>Pirates</em> movie was released and it was no longer necessary to maintain a Disney-approved image, he pretty much became what he was: a normal single man in his late twenties/early thirties who liked to have fun. To top it off, he began dating Miranda Kerr, a sexy Victoria's Secret model, and couldn't keep his hands off of her (they later got married and had a son, although they're now separated). <br/><br/>His "offenses" were no different from what one would expect from anyone else in his position and were actually pretty tame, but certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> within the fandom were outraged by his behavior, blowing every incident out of proportion and declaring him ruined because they felt he somehow let them down by not continuing to maintain an unrealistically pure image. Since then, he has moved on to roles more proportionate to his age, aimed at a more mature audience, and has been receiving a decent amount of acclaim for them, so the loss of his contractual purity hasn't hurt him much.
</li><li> Lisa Bonet was tossed off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> for her role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelHeart">Angel Heart</a></em> that included a sex scene, and loudly denounced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a>. Years later, after Cosby himself was accused and sued by dozens of women for past sexual assaults and rapes, this moral grandstanding became the height of hypocrisy in hindsight.
</li><li> Child actor Brian Bonsall, best known for his role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em> as sweet little Andy Keaton, was known for playing young innocent boys who were a bit mischievous in his feature film debut <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mikey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mikey">Mikey</a></em>, in which he portrays a 9-year-old serial killer who was abused by his original parents. In real life, he became a failed rockstar, drug addict, and eventually a fugitive of justice.
</li><li> Pretty much subverted by Steve Burns of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues">Blue's Clues</a></em> fame — he has explicitly stated that he has no desire to kill the image of <em>Blue's Clues</em>' Steve by doing anything terribly unseemly. He's even said that he has refused requests to have sex in the Blue's Clues 'Thinking Chair' that he was given, on the grounds that it would feel like a bunch of parents were watching him do it. He <em>has</em> more recently pursued a career as an indie rock singer/songwriter and been photographed drinking, but this was long after he left the show.
<ul><li> This comes up partially because of a role he took on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em> during his tenure on <em>Blue's Clues</em>. It was because a child saw him in that role (why the parents allowed it is a mystery for a later time) that Burns made his public statement that he would not take on roles that might upset fans too young to understand that he wasn't really Steve on <em>Blue's Clues</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> There was some controversy when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeishaCastleHughes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeishaCastleHughes">Keisha Castle-Hughes</a>, who played Mary in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNativityStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNativityStory">The Nativity Story</a></em>, got pregnant while unmarried and 16-years old. However, many Christian groups did praise her for going through with the pregnancy and raising the child.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">single most famous example</a> is Marilyn Chambers. As a young model, her picture graced boxes of Ivory Snow detergent across the United States. When she became one of porn's most famous stars, Ivory Snow got a very quick repackaging. Also, contrary to popular legend, Marilyn Chambers was not the baby, but the young mother holding the baby.
</li><li> This trope was a big reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a>'s sex scandal became as big an issue as it did. Ever since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> in the '80s, he'd had a reputation as "America's Dad" and a role model for young people, especially young black men, and was known for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">criticism of violence and sexuality in the media</a> (particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop">Hip-Hop</a>). The allegations that he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape">date raped</a> a number of women over the course of his career, combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">his reaction to them</a>, destroyed that image and all but turned him into the American equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile">Jimmy Savile</a>. A number of articles published in the wake of the allegations (especially once it became clear that many of them were true) bemoaned how African Americans had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">lost one of their best role models in a storm of scandal</a>, and how "if you can't trust Bill Cosby anymore, who <em>can</em> you trust?"
</li><li> One year after the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone">Home Alone</a></em> film came out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MacaulayCulkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MacaulayCulkin">Macaulay Culkin</a> was seen starring in the R-rated film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodSon">The Good Son</a></em> where he plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">a 10-year-old psychopath</a>. Among the things Culkin's character does are killing a dog with a homemade nailgun, causing a highway crash by dropping a dummy off a bridge, attempting to kill his mother, and as it's later found out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murdering his younger brother by drowning him in the bathtub.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a>'s review can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930924/REVIEWS/309240303/1023">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> ...and yet, he still was caught in the trope when, a <em>full decade later</em>, he played Michael Alig, the controversial founder of Club Kids, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PartyMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PartyMonster">Party Monster</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakotaFanning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakotaFanning">Dakota Fanning</a> getting raped in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hounddog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hounddog">Hounddog</a></em> caused controversy until the critics came out of the theater stating they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">laughing at that part</a>, and the overall effect was pretty minimal.
<ul><li> She might have had more luck playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett">Joan Jett</a>'s former bandmate Cherie Currie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRunaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRunaways">The Runaways</a></em>. However, this movie didn't have a chance to cause much controversy on account of getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">screwed by the studio</a>.
</li><li> Right now, she has several projects (<em>Mississippi Wild</em>, <em>Now is Good</em>, <em>Very Good Girls</em>) where the character she plays ends up losing her virginity.
</li><li> Surprisingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleFanning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleFanning">Elle Fanning</a> averted this trope with her acting career, not following in her older sisters footsteps. When the highly controversial <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNeonDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNeonDemon">The Neon Demon</a></em> was released, pretty much any discourse about her career (which mostly consisted of relatively family friendly roles up to that point) was given a backseat to the films shocking content itself. That films darkly satirical treatment of this trope might have helped.
</li></ul></li><li> This happened to Sherri Finkbine, the hostess of Phoenix's localized <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RomperRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RomperRoom">Romper Room</a></em>. She had been taking thalidomide while pregnant and sought an abortion when she was convinced that her baby would be deformed<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note226q7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note226q7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note226q7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">sure enough, when the baby was aborted it was revealed that it had no legs and one arm</span>. The incident caused her to become linked with the pro-choice movement (this was all the way back in 1962). The incident also inspired a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Private_Matter">1992 telefilm.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.deadline.com/2010/10/racy-glee-gq-shoot-creates-controversy/">The controversy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> over the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> photo shoot for <em>GQ</em> magazine. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">the Parents' Television Council</a>, two 24-year-old women and a 28-year-old man posing for PG-13-rated photos "borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">pedophilia</a>" just because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">play teenagers</a> on a TV show that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">never intended to be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">watched by children</a>. Even worse was when the same group of people flipped out, using the same reasoning, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeaMichele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeaMichele">Lea Michele</a> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/02/04/glee-star-lea-michelles-sexy-switch-moms-mad/">wore a low-cut top<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> on the cover of <em>Cosmo</em>.
</li><li> For a long time, Adrian Hall, who played Jeremy Potts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChittyChittyBangBang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChittyChittyBangBang">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a></em>, would omit the movie on his resume and ask his manager to not mention it because he was afraid it would damage his credibility as an adult actor, i.e. that casting directors would only see him as a "child actor". But as he got successful in his adult acting career, he would put the movie on his resume and speak about it more often.
</li><li> Nicholas Hammond (aka Friedrich von Trapp) remarked in the special features of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em> DVD that he had tried to avoid doing anything that would get him in the papers in a bad light because he "didn't want to ruin the image" and the rest of his castmates agreed with him. Slightly subverted in that A) they didn't seem to mind all that much and B) Nicholas is really the only one involved with film these days (in Australia).
<ul><li> Heather Menzies (aka Louisa von Trapp) appeared naked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a></em>'s August 1973 issue and did nude scenes in a couple of B-Movies.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a>, sweet little Willow Rosenberg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>, managed to avoid this when she took on the role of kinky, foul-mouthed Michelle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie">American Pie</a></em>. Perhaps the fact that Willow herself was allowed to grow up (and come out of the closet) may have had something to do with that.
<ul><li> Or the fact that <em>Buffy</em> was never really aimed at the "corruptible" demographic to begin with.
</li><li> Michelle is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> of this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. Throughout the movie, Jim and the audience are meant to think of Michelle as naive and irritating. Her infamous "band camp" story was meant to be a surprise, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">got ruined by the trailers</a>, and now it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">what people associate most with the character</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The cast of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> films have faced this at one point or another.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielRadcliffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielRadcliffe">Daniel Radcliffe</a> invoked a wave of moral outrage when he appeared on London's West End as Alan Strang in a production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Equus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Equus">Equus</a></em>. It's an incredible (albeit disturbing) role that any actor would be insane to turn down the chance to play. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>, however, only saw Naked!<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> — which is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">what the production company was banking on</a>, anyway.
<ul><li> Radcliffe has managed to avert this in other ways: around the release of the final <em>Potter</em> movie, tabloids started reporting that he liked his liquor a tad too much. However, at this point, Daniel's in his 20s and he openly admitted he had a drinking problem and got help for it, so this story produced sympathy and "attaboy"s rather than parents screaming about "Harry" being a bad influence for their sweet little darlings.
</li><li> Radcliffe seems to have become one of the defining subversions of this trope. Among those still following his career, he's now known as an Indie character actor at least as much as he's known for being Harry. There was virtually no controversy over his role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SwissArmyMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SwissArmyMan">Swiss Army Man</a></em>, and he played an outright sociopathic villain in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NowYouSeeMe2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NowYouSeeMe2">Now You See Me 2</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, there was some uproar about Clémence Poésy (Fleur Delacour) appearing topless in a French movie, even though it was before she was even cast in the film.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson">Emma Watson</a> caused shockwaves in the fandom for a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BalletShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BalletShoes">Ballet Shoes</a></em> where her character shares a bath with her adoptive sister, and especially for the final movie where apparitions of Harry and Hermione make out naked. After completing the franchise, she went for more mature roles to shake the purity off; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePerksOfBeingAWallflower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePerksOfBeingAWallflower">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a></em> has her playing a character who was molested as a child and performs a raunchy routine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em>; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlingRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlingRing">The Bling Ring</a></em> she plays a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl">Shameless Fanservice Girl</a> who drinks, smokes and robs celebrities' houses; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Noah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Noah">Noah</a></em> likewise has her character's fertility as a plot point. None of these stopped Disney from casting her as Belle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeautyAndTheBeast2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeautyAndTheBeast2017">Beauty and the Beast (2017)</a></em>.
</li><li> Jamie Waylett (Vincent Crabbe) got this in 2009 after being arrested for possession of marijuana, being written out of the last two films (when his character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was slated to be killed off later</span> — they wound up replacing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crabbe's death with that of Goyle</span> for the movie to compensate), even though Crabbe isn't a particularly "wholesome" character to start with. Waylett later attracted further controversy after being charged with violence during the London riots in August 2011.
</li><li> On the other side, it seems pretty much no one cares that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RupertGrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RupertGrint">Rupert Grint</a> acted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cherrybomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cherrybomb">Cherrybomb</a></em>, playing a character who does drugs and steals cars. Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater">he's a bad guy who's supposed to do bad things</a>.
</li><li> Evanna Lynch seems as if she's trying to avoid this. As she's the cast member who can be said to be most like her character, she has opted for darker roles to distance herself from Luna. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyNameIsEmily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyNameIsEmily">My Name Is Emily</a></em> in particular has her playing a suicidal teen.
</li><li> Harry Melling, who plays Dudley Dursley in the films, has lost a huge amount of weight over the years (to the point of having to wear a fat suit for the final movie) and is barely recognizable from his younger self. He's publicly stated he is happy about this so he can avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a> in his adult career as an actor.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaJoanHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaJoanHart">Melissa Joan Hart</a>:
<ul><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ClarissaExplainsItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ClarissaExplainsItAll">Clarissa Explains It All</a></em> finished its run, Melissa was now an adult but her mother didn't want her to pursue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> roles - though this was apparently a business move to capitalise on her kid fanbase. Thus her next project was the family sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em>. She has said that once that was over, she found it hard to get cast, because people only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">saw her as a teenager</a>, even though she was in her late 20s when the show finished<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jumm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3jumm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jumm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even within the context of the show, Sabrina became a college student in the fifth season and the producers wanted to just call the show <em>Sabrina</em>, but faced resistance from Archie Comics</span> . Thus people were startled at her playing a mother on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelissaAndJoey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelissaAndJoey">Melissa &amp; Joey</a></em>.
</li><li> During <em>Sabrina</em>'s third season, the folks at Archie Comics were sent into a frenzy when she appeared in a racy photo shoot for Maxim - and they are infamously protective of their wholesome brand. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, they were annoyed that the shoot advertised Sabrina rather than Melissa, making it look like she was doing it as the character.
</li><li> This trope is also the reason Melissa kept her partying hidden from the public eye - claiming she spent a year doing drugs and rolling with a bad crowd (the Maxim photo shoot actually happened while she was on drugs).
</li></ul><div class="indent"> "It's not that I wasn't a bad girl. I just didn't get caught."
</div><ul><li> Melissa mentioned in an interview once that when she had her first child (at the perfectly reasonable age of 29 and having been married for three years), she got complaints from people saying she was too young to have a child. Apparently, they didn't realize she wasn't as young as the characters she played.
</li></ul></li><li> Possibly the most dreadful example of all was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnissaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnissaJones">Anissa Jones</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyAffair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyAffair">Family Affair</a></em>. She was contractually obligated to make promotional appearances with her breasts bound, her hair in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails">childish pigtails</a>, and clutching the Mrs. Beasley doll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">even as she grew into her teens</a>. This is often cited as a major factor in her eventual death by drug overdose.
</li><li> David Joyner, the original suit actor for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney the Dinosaur</a>, now works as a tantric sex-based therapist while not acting. Suprisingly, the discovery of this career by the internet did not led to him getting booted from his current suit acting role, that being the titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HipHopHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HipHopHarry">Hip Hop Harry</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahKerr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahKerr">Deborah Kerr</a> was usually typecast as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnglishRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnglishRose">English Rose</a> (with the exception of UK drama <em>Black Narcissus</em>) until her appearance as depressed adulteress Karen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FromHereToEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FromHereToEternity">From Here to Eternity</a></em>. It's still considered one of her best roles of all time, even though she took the role only to shake up her image.
</li><li> Completely averted when nudes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLawrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> leaked online in 2014. The vast majority of public response wasn't directed at her, but the people who shared the photos. It turns out that hacking into a person's online account, stealing their private pics, and posting them online are far more heinous crimes than a grown woman taking sexy pics intended for her partner's eyes only.
<ul><li> She since appeared nude in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mother2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mother2017">mother!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedSparrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedSparrow">Red Sparrow</a></em>. She never did nude scenes up until that point in her own work (partly because of the leak) but decided to take a chance on both because of how empowered she felt by the female leads owning their sexuality. Despite the polarizing reactions to both films themselves, Lawrences performances were highly acclaimed, with some calling her role in <em>mother!</em> a career best.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatyManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatyManning">Katy Manning</a> got some flak for posing naked with a Dalek in a men's magazine sometime after she left <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>. Some fans even bring it up while criticizing Jo as being a helpless victim for male characters to kidnap and slaver over, even though the character in the show is generally strong and plucky and not especially sexualized (although by no means a completely unproblematic blow for feminism).
</li><li> Taylor Momsen began her career as a child actor, famously as Cindy Lou in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas">How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</a></em> and she nearly played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em> too. Although she got a role on the CW series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>, her character was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenWholesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenWholesome">Token Wholesome</a>. But she soon started going for a much racier public image, which ended up being reflected in <em>Gossip Girl</em>'s third season. When she formed her band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyReckless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyReckless">The Pretty Reckless</a> she caused a minor scandal by appearing nude in their video for "Make Me Wanna Die" - when she was only sixteen. She has since quit acting altogether and focused on her music, stating she "doesn't fucking care" about being a good role model.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKateAndAshleyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKateAndAshleyOlsen">Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen</a> were child and teen stars thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoOfAKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoOfAKind">Two of a Kind</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoLittleTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoLittleTime">So Little Time</a></em> (as well as all their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> projects). In their teen years, actor Spencer Pratt sold a photo of Mary-Kate drunk to the media, and Mary Kate was also linked to Heath Ledger's death - nearly being subpoenaed to testify as to how he got his drugs. Their second only theatrical movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NewYorkMinute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NewYorkMinute">New York Minute</a></em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">Box Office Bomb</a> and got attacked for being "creepy and lecherous" (Ashley is "nude" under a towel twice in it).
</li><li> This trope dates back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilentAgeOfHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilentAgeOfHollywood">silent days</a>, at least. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryPickford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryPickford">Mary Pickford</a> ("America's Sweetheart"), one of the biggest stars of the early cinema, was known for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue">ingenue</a> roles and her long, flowing ringlets. After she cut off her curls and played an adult role — at the age of <em>37</em> — in <em>Coquette</em>, she lost her popularity (despite winning an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Award</a>), and retired from films shortly thereafter.
</li><li> Defied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BetteDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BetteDavis">Bette Davis</a> - who Warner Brothers were grooming to become "the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanHarlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanHarlow">Jean Harlow</a>" in the early 1930s. She hated their attempts to present her as a glamorous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor">Girl Next Door</a> (the low point for her was a film called <em>Fashions of 1934</em>, in which she was forced to wear a platinum blonde wig and false eyelashes). She was keen to play a role as an unsympathetic abuser who ends up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Streetwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Streetwalker">Streetwalker</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfHumanBondage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfHumanBondage">Of Human Bondage</a></em> - which many of Hollywood's leading ladies had turned down. The studio tried to persuade her not to do it, terrified it would ruin her image. The film was a critical darling, and Bette got her first Oscar nomination from it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper">Billie Piper</a>:
<ul><li> She got some flak for posing in <em>Arena</em> just before her debut as Rose Tyler in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>. She later had to specifically warn her young fans from that show that it would not be a good idea for them to watch <em>Secret Diary of a Call Girl</em>. She didn't get much heat from the tabloids for switching to the more risqué role, however.
</li><li> Also before <em>Doctor Who</em>, Piper was also criticized in the press for being photographed partying around the time of her marriage to radio presenter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ChrisEvans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/ChrisEvans">Chris Evans</a>. At the time, she was known not for Rose Tyler, but being a former teen pop star once touted as the British answer to Britney Spears. In fairness, though, this was primarily due to the fact that she was a teenager and Chris Evans was in his mid-thirties, and when they got married, they'd only been dating for six months. Since Piper was in a period of limbo where her pop career had pretty much died (and her acting one was yet to take off) when she started dating Evans, and since he was an extremely wealthy radio and television presenter (worth an estimated £30million), it was as much about the unseemliness of the apparent "golddigger/dirty old man" dynamic as much as Piper being a role model for teenagers. Much was made in the press, for example, of Chris buying her a pricey sports car for her birthday when she hadn't even passed her driving test yet. By the time of their divorce six years later, Piper was in her mid-twenties and the 16 year age gap between them seemed less important. Whatever the case, she seems to get a lot more of the flak from the relationship than he does. Although it's most likely partly down to good old misogyny (she must be a gold-digging whore, he's a man who couldn't be expected to resist a young hottie), it seems like her contractual purity plays a part too.
</li></ul></li><li> Numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a> have surprised the fandom with their career moves following the show:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank">Jason David Frank</a> (Tommy Oliver from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">four</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">different</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">seasonal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder">arcs</a>) is now an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">MMA</a> fighter. This isn't too shocking to the fandom, who knew that "JDF" is probably the most skilled martial artist in the show's history, but a lot of eyebrows were raised about the <a class="urllink" href="http://cdn.buzznet.com/media/jj1/2009/09/jdf-mma/jason-david-frank-mma-01.jpg">massive number of tattoos he's picked up along the way.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> No wonder he was always wearing sweaters in <em>Dino Thunder</em>. Perhaps softening the blow is the fact that he's also a devout Christian, running a Christian MMA clothing line called <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jesusdidnttap.com/">"Jesus Didn't Tap"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Frank also appeared on MTV's sex drama <em>Undressed</em> after leaving the franchise (but before returning for <em>Dino Thunder</em>). Nobody really noticed though that says more about the show than it does about Jason. Hilariously enough, the majority of his scenes were with actress Alyson Kiperman, who <strong>also</strong> became a Power Ranger (Yellow in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Power Rangers Wild Force</a>.</em>) Ranger fans have been laughing their asses off since.

She's also shown up, clothes-optional, in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-grade</a> horror films for the college set. Allegedly, she became concerned about being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Typecasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Typecasting">typecast</a> for nudity and even haggled with a director over how many inches of her derriere would be revealed in a movie (which the director verified with a ruler).
</li><li> Ricardo Medina Jr. (Cole from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Wild Force</a></em>) eventually showed up on the reality competition <em>Kept</em> for VH-1. It was, in a nutshell, a show with a lot of muscular guys being male models and being photographed in their underwear or even in their birthday suits with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor">Scenery Censor</a>. Ricardo was considered to be quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> by both the other contestants and some viewers and was ultimately eliminated from the show for simply being too vain to have around.

<ul><li> Apparently the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> is stronger than this trope, as he's returned to <em>Power Rangers</em> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Rival</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Samurai</a></em>.

</li><li> Also worth pointing out, he was still with the revue <em>while</em> being on <em>Power Rangers</em>, though the group is one in the vein of Chippendales, being classier and not getting down to actual nudity on-stage.
</li><li> His career eventually got put on hold when, in 2017, he pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the 2015 killing of his roommate and was sentenced to six years in prison.

However, the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">was mistaken</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">for an actual kids' entertainer</a> as he became successful, causing Reubens' act to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">more family-friendly</a> and his personal life to be taken over by the character. Thus, his arrest for masturbating in an adult theater, and his subsequent arrest for having pornography in his house (not child pornography, as rumored), came as a shock to those who weren't familiar with his older material. This caused comedian <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WandaSykes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WandaSykes">Wanda Sykes</a> to remark, "Just where is Pee Wee allowed to masturbate?"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MollyRingwald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MollyRingwald">Molly Ringwald</a> appeared nude in the film <em>Malicious</em>, going against her "sweet teenage girl" image. However, the film wasn't really memorable, and she hadn't been a teenager for over a decade at that point, so the ripples were minor. Before that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch">David Lynch</a> offered her the role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlueVelvet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlueVelvet">Blue Velvet</a></em> that eventually went to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LauraDern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LauraDern">Laura Dern</a>, but her parents refused to let her do it, worried that it would ruin her "sweet teenage girl" image.
</li><li> In 1988, sixteen-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WinonaRyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WinonaRyder">Winona Ryder</a>, known at the time for family-friendly roles in films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lucas">Lucas</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beetlejuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a></em>, was begged by her agent not to star in the R-rated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers">Heathers</a></em>, fearing that her career would be over. The same week Winona received the script, a schoolmate of hers died of suicide, which inspired her to do the film (whose plot revolves heavily around teen suicide) in spite of potential career damage. The film was a hit and Winona had plenty of success in the '90s.
</li><li> Though not beginning as a child, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobSaget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobSaget">Bob Saget</a> had this happen to him over a sixteen-year stretch divided between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasFunniestHomeVideos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasFunniestHomeVideos">America's Funniest Home Videos</a></em>. He attributes his current profanity-overflowing, exceptionally dirty and rather mean-spirited stand-up routine in part to this, claiming, "That show gave me <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTourettes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTourettes">Tourette's</a>." In actuality, he was an exceptionally dirty comic, even before <em>Full House</em>. At his roast, Jeff Garlin in the character of one of the producers of <em>Full House</em> mentioned an incredibly tasteless joke that Bob told that warmed the producer up to him. People who knew him in college also claimed he did dirty humor, even back then. While he may attribute it to his family shows, his dirty persona may have deeper roots than he lets on. Unlike many cases here, Saget actually enjoys the stigma that follows him, just for the shock that appears on people's faces in the audience, who didn't know better.
</li><li> Likewise, Saget's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> co-star, John Stamos, was best known for his role on the show as Uncle Jesse. He grew tired of being in family-friendly TV shows and movies. So he decided to shed this image by auditioning for the raunchiest part he could: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> <em>Fatal Vows: The Alexandra O'Hara Story</em> in which he portrays Nick Pagan, a seemingly nice man who is actually a serial killer and later tries to burn his five-year-old son to death in the bathtub.
<ul><li> After his tenure on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>, however, most of his family-friendly stigma is gone. Since then, he's been in a few commercials and has done a few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>. One particular episode he stars in has him as a pig who exploits a multitude of women for sex in order to have copious amounts of children, and he sweet-talks them out of whatever job they may have.

<ul><li> Carroll Spinney (Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch) describes a bad encounter in his autobiography.

In 2012, he took a sabbatical from <em>Sesame Street</em> after a young man claimed that the two of them had a sexual relationship when he was 16. Clash did not deny the relationship but claimed it happened after the young man had turned 18. The accuser later withdrew the allegations, but a series of other accusers came forward in its wake. Needless to say, the "sabbatical" has turned into a full-on departure, with Ryan Dillon taking over Muppeteering duties for Elmo since.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenStewart">Kristen Stewart</a> became a victim of this after photos of her smoking pot outside her house were published. She began as a child actor and then got her big break as Bella Swan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>. Knowing how Kristen Stewart and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson">Robert Pattinson</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">feel about their roles as Bella and Edward</a>, it's entirely possible that the reason she didn't take that joint inside is that she was hoping on this trope coming into play. She and Pattinson have admitted that they don't go along with contractual purity because neither would see being dropped from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">as such a bad thing</a>. She was also probably smart enough to know that she and Pattinson were <em>the</em> faces of the franchise, and could do just about anything except murder or kiddie porn and still be asked back for the next one. Kristen faced similar accusations when rumours came out of an affair between her and the married director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman">Snow White and the Huntsman</a></em>. Both were dropped from the franchise after the first film, although Kristen herself claims she was still offered scripts and just turned them down. Since then, Kristen has come out as bisexual, embraced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">butch</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">lad-ette</a> image, and done mostly independent and foreign films (often with nude scenes), putting her days as the "good girl" Bella firmly behind her.

Also not shocking was the fact that the "war hero" tore through her money, beat her black and blue, and used her contacts to land acting jobs, all the while trash-talking her to directors so they wouldn't hire her and she'd have to depend financially on him.

</li><li> According to the documentary <em>Becoming Bond</em>, one of the reasons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLazenby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLazenby">George Lazenby</a> turned down starring in further Bond films was that he would have had to sign what he called a "slave contract" that would essentially dictate his image and behaviour offset during the production of the next <em>seven</em> proposed films.

But people were worried that it would harm Julia's wholesome image, so that plot point was dropped. She did attempt to do a less squeaky-clean role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryReilly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryReilly">Mary Reilly</a></em> - which has repressed Victorian sexuality as a major theme (though is still quite tame when it comes to nudity) - but it wasn't a great success.

</p><p>There are some notable aversions and inversions, where the actor or actress's first role (or at least breakout role) is in a decidedly adult production, only for them to move onto more family-friendly fare.

The studio tried to enforce this with images of her doing charity work to seem like a more wholesome All-American type.
</li><li> The exact opposite of this trope happened when Linda Blair, who played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Regan</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist">The Exorcist</a></em>, tried to break into romantic comedies. After scaring the living daylights out of America, people had a hard time taking her seriously in lighter roles. She did manage a recurring role in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7">S Club 7</a> TV series as the band's quirky landlady - although it was twenty years after her horror days.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferConnelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferConnelly">Jennifer Connelly</a>'s first leading role was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarioArgento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarioArgento">Dario Argento</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Phenomena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Phenomena">Phenomena</a></em> making her roles in movies such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RequiemForADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RequiemForADream">Requiem for a Dream</a></em> not that drastic a change.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirstenDunst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirstenDunst">Kirsten Dunst</a> is another notable aversion who made her breakout role as a child vampire in the <em>distinctly</em> family-unfriendly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InterviewWithTheVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InterviewWithTheVampire">Interview with the Vampire</a></em> at the age of 12.

In her twenties, she admitted to occasionally smoking weed and drinking too much.

</li><li> The trope was played in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inversion">reverse</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradleyJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradleyJames">Bradley James</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieMcGrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieMcGrath">Katie McGrath</a>. Both starred in the family-friendly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>, but their first television roles involved the former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DisConnected" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DisConnected">having sex in a toilet cubicle</a> and the latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors">being taken from behind by Henry VIII</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeatherMatarazzo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeatherMatarazzo">Heather Matarazzo</a>, like Connelly, also started acting at thirteen, her breakout role being in the ultra-dark cult classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WelcomeToTheDollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WelcomeToTheDollhouse">Welcome to the Dollhouse</a></em>.

Still pretty messed up, though.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChloeMoretz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChloeMoretz">Chloë Moretz</a>'s breakthrough role was playing Hit-Girl in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss">film adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em>. Most people's introduction to the then-twelve-year-old actress came through a preview clip in which she says "okay, you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">cunts</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromTheMouthsOfBabes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromTheMouthsOfBabes">let's see what you can do now</a>" before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior">violently slaughtering a horde of mooks</a>, a clip that provoked outrage from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and the press. As such, she had no problem transitioning into adult roles once she grew up, moving between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMiseducationOfCameronPost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMiseducationOfCameronPost">dark dramas about conversion therapy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAddamsFamily2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAddamsFamily2019">animated family comedies</a> without any whiplash. It helps that, in real life, Moretz is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyCharacterBoringActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyCharacterBoringActor">extremely straight-laced</a>. At the time, she couldn't even bring herself to say the title of <em>Kick-Ass</em> out loud, instead calling it just "the film" during interviews and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Badbutt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Badbutt">"Kick-Butt"</a> in private, and as an adult, she's become known for her outspoken feminist views.

She then parodied this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> sketch "Natalie's Rap", in which she reveals through rap that she drinks, does drugs, has promiscuous sex, enjoys killing and beating people (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">and dogs</a>) for fun, and has a general disdain for her younger fans.

However, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, she became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting">known almost solely</a> for her cute and perky roles in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy">romantic comedies</a> — to the point where there was considerable audience backlash whenever she tried to return to her dramatic roots in films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityOfAngels">City of Angels</a></em> and <em>In the Cut</em>.
</li><li> Another inversion is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KathleenTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KathleenTurner">Kathleen Turner</a>, who gained early prominence with steamy roles in films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BodyHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BodyHeat">Body Heat</a></em>, but then shifted almost entirely into lighter, fluffier fare like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeggySueGotMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeggySueGotMarried">Peggy Sue Got Married</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomancingTheStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomancingTheStone">Romancing the Stone</a></em>.
</li><li> Brazilian model Xuxa (show-name; her real name is Maria da Graça Meneghel) started her career with naked pictorials and softcore porn movies. Then she became that country's biggest children's TV hostess. Unlike most of the people on this list, she's never seemed to make any bones about her pornographic past, even making statements to the effect that "sex symbols and children go hand in hand." That said, she did sue Google and various other sites to block search results for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">one film in particular</a>, <em>Amor Estranho Amor</em>, namely because it has a scene where she <em>seduces a 12-year-old boy</em> while dressed as a teddy bear (said outfit having about the same amount of cloth as one, even). The Google suit has failed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewBarrymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewBarrymore">Drew Barrymore</a> zig-zagged through this.

She still worked in the industry, however, and the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoisonIvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoisonIvy">Poison Ivy</a></em> was essentially her playing on the public's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaCasting">perception of her</a>. After getting sober in the '90s, she carved out a career as a respected adult actress - in films that were far more squeaky clean like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NeverBeenKissed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NeverBeenKissed">Never Been Kissed</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EverAfter">Ever After</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWeddingSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWeddingSinger">The Wedding Singer</a></em>, etc.

She retired from acting at the age of 13 in 2000, graduated from college while studying drama, and is as of 2014 a blogger, playwright, burgeoning novelist, and volunteer social worker in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a>. Despite being in her late twenties, and having not been in any kind of acting role outside of online web project and college stage acting, she often receives (online and in person) negative comments from many fans that their childhoods were ruined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">regarding how her figure filled out</a> in the years since she left Hollywood, and commentary about her often profane language, liberal outspokenness and more adult humor on her website, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> account and writings. She has also expressed some horror that journalists reviewing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMusical">Broadway musical version</a> of <em>Matilda</em> recommended fans of the musical see a performance of her play, <em>Sheeple</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">emphasizing that the play</a> is <em>not</em> for kids.

She also describes a very straight example from when she and a group of other child actors were part of a charity camping trip - and they got punished for playing Spin The Bottle in their tent. It apparently made the organisation look bad to be seen doing such a thing.

Like Walt Disney, she did made an effort to conceal her smoking habit from the public, especially considering how people largely associate her with her career as an iconic child actress, and it would be a disservice especially for younger generations of fans to see her light up a Lucky Strike or two.

In general, sports stars are often forced to act as "role models" to an even greater degree than most celebrities are.
<p></p><ul><li> Charles Barkley famously used this stigma to great effect in a Nike commercial that began with him saying, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">I am not a role model</a>." The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> that protested the commercial apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">skipped the second half of the ad</a>, where Barkley expands on this: "<em>Parents</em> should be role models. I get paid to play basketball, <em>not</em> to raise your kids."
<ul><li> To be fair, some versions of the commercial cut the second half, so it looks like he really is abdicating any responsibility without assigning it to the parents.
</li></ul></li><li> In a book about Joe Namath, the author relates how he and Joe were in an elevator and Joe was drinking from a beer bottle. When the elevator arrived at their floor, Joe saw some kids and had to stash the bottle under his shirt.
</li><li> Olympic swimming hero Michael Phelps had a photo of him partaking of a bong (which technically could have had something like tobacco... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">oh, who are we kidding</a>?), was plastered all over the Internet. He was banned from national competition for three months and Kellogg's dropped him from their sponsorship list. He <em>did</em> dodge the big Olympic-sized bullet as the rules are only about "performance-<strong>enhancing</strong>" drugs<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8fdgn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8fdgn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8fdgn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Marijuana could only be considered as such if there was a giant bag of Doritos at the end of the pool.</span> <em>during competition</em>.
<ul><li> Also, he was in Ann Arbor, Michigan. You know, the city where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanU">local campus</a> hosts a "Hash Bash" every year on its central quad (the Diag), and where getting caught with marijuana is a civil infraction — no worse than a <em>parking ticket</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> This seemed about to happen (or at least some people seemed to be trying to make it an issue) following the Women's hockey final at the 2010 Winter Olympics when, after the game, the Canadian team were photographed doing such "unladylike" things in celebration after the arena had emptied such as smoking big stogies, enjoying beer and champagne, and goofing off driving the Zamboni around the rink while whooping it up. Members of the International Olympic Committee (who don't really like women's hockey being an event, to begin with) tut-tutted in disapproval and made noises about considering whether Canada should keep the gold medal. Most of the public and the Canadian reps pointed out that had the <em>male</em> hockey players been seen celebrating after what was for some the biggest game of their lives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">no one would have said anything</a>. The image of IOC president Jacques Rogge being tarred, feathered, and hung from a totem pole in Stanley Park probably had nothing to do with the matter being dropped.
</li><li> Tiger Woods had his career wrecked virtually overnight (although it didn't last that long) when various parties revealed that he had a long and colorful secret love life after years of being presented as a role model for all ages.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9i1l0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9i1l0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9i1l0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The "overnight" part was the news story of how he crashed his SUV in his gated community... leaving the house after his (now ex-) wife Elin Nordegren confronted him with her knowledge of his extramarital affairs.</span>
</li><li> Baseball Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett's long-established "good guy" image was forever ruined when in September 2002, he was arrested for allegedly groping a woman in a restroom in the Redstone American Grill in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. To make matters worse, a 2003 <em>Sports Illustrated</em> article from Frank Deford documented Puckett's alleged indiscretions (such as cheating on his wife and being all-around abusive to her).
</li><li> In an interesting aversion, baseball great Stan "The Man" Musial cultivated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a> when he started playing for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1940s and never broke it for the rest of his life. He stated that he <em>did</em> see himself as a role model and strove to be one. He was 92 years old at the time of death and St. Louisans still absolutely adore him — so much that they campaigned for him to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom and he did receive it in January 2011. While this was wonderful for Stan, it's impossible for any other Cardinal (or any player) to live up to. Of course, it was probably easier to live life as a role model before the invasive modern celebrity culture had developed.
<ul><li> Albert Pujols was also the victim of this trope when he signed with the Los Angeles Angels for a 10-year $250 million contract. Fans had essentially determined that Albert was Stan's successor (and in a lot of ways he is/was: both are/were family men, philanthropists, etc.), and since Stan never left St. Louis, Albert is obviously the worst traitor in the history of traitors ever for doing so. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Some Cardinals fans burned their Pujols jerseys</a> and others (mostly older fans) turned the whole thing into a morality play and immediately started going on about Stan and the good ol' days. A few people took the time to understand why the whole things actually happened, though.
</li><li> As for Pujols' predecessor at first base for the Cardinals, Mark McGwire, he along with a great many baseball players (including Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds) forever lost their "role model" status when their links to steroids were uncovered. McGwire himself was actually upfront about one steroid he had done, androstenedione, which despite being banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, was at the time available over-the-counter and <em>not</em> banned by MLB.
</li></ul></li><li> American track star Suzy Favor Hamilton, back when she was Suzy Favor, was one of the most decorated athletes in NCAA history at the University of Wisconsin, and eventually ran in three Olympic marathons. She had built a career as a motivational speaker, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootballConferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootballConferences">Big Ten Conference</a> named its annual award for its top female athlete after her. Then it was discovered that she worked as a call girl, which torpedoed her career, and led the Big Ten to strip her name from the award (pun not intended).

He then moved to Archie and set the tone for the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> with many of the same tricks he used on his Marvel work: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">No Fourth Wall</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns">Hurricane of Puns</a>, and stock parodies. Come the mid-1990s, he moved over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Mad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Mad">MAD</a></em>, where he performed a curious zig-zag. His early material was mainly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SpyVsSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SpyVsSpy">Spy vs. Spy</a></em> gags drawn by <em>Sonic</em> collaborator Dave Manak, but upon pairing up with artist Tom Bunk, Gallagher began writing horribly grotesque gags such as a boy popping a zit so large that he drowns in his own pus, or a mother saying that her kids "eat like a bird" before vomiting directly into their mouths. But when paired with any other artist, Gallagher generally continues to write relatively lighthearted fare.

Pop stars, in particular, are held to this on account of their fanbases typically being largely comprised of teen and tween girls.
<p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> had something of a (relatively) clean-cut, madcap, teen-friendly "mop-top" image, and were a youthful breath of fresh air in America following the JFK assassination. They were advised to stay away from politics and kept much of the rougher aspects of their personalities and humor (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">burgeoning marijuana use</a>) under wraps. Then came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">more popular</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus">than Jesus</a>" misquote, and later Paul's admission in the British press of trying LSD. Though it took a toll on their "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Beatlemania</a>" image, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">the changing times</a>, their refusal to tour, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie">psychedelic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">facial hair-wearing</a> period would soon follow with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em>.

By the late '60s, the group would develop a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">more serious image</a> for the rest of their careers.
<ul><li> It went the other way in their own country. From the moment they emerged into the public consciousness, the Beatles were seen in the media as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">corrupting the morals of British youth</a>. With their (comparatively) long hair and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snarky image</a>, they were quite unlike the clean-cut would-be home-made Elvis clones that came before, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CliffRichard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CliffRichard">Cliff Richard</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TommySteele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TommySteele">Tommy Steele</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MartyWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MartyWilde">Marty Wilde</a>, or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyFury">Billy Fury</a>, whom one could comfortably take home to tea with one's mother despite those rebellious stage names. By the time the Beatles had hit America, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> (and, heaven forbid, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyThings">The Pretty Things</a>) had emerged and one's mother could then accept the Beatles as cuddly.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoneThugsNHarmony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoneThugsNHarmony">Bone Thugs-n-Harmony</a> after <em>Tha Crossroads</em>, much to the chagrin of fans that prefer their darker, harder stuff.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharlotteChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharlotteChurch">Charlotte Church</a> began her career aged 12 as a classical singer with a squeaky-clean image that played on her background from a Catholic family in Wales. As a teenager, she was photographed smoking, drinking and going to clubs; and stated repeatedly that she wanted to shed her "choir girl" image, to criticism from fans and the press. She also made offensive comments about Pope Benedict XVI, frequently swore in interviews and engaged in a public feud with the pop group Scooch. She did eventually release a moderately successful pop/rock album and is now better known as a TV presenter and the ex-girlfriend of rugby player Gavin Henson. Church addressed the problems of this trope herself in her statement to the Leveson Inquiry regarding phone-hacking by journalists.
<ul><li> The thing about this (and a large part of her contribution to the Leveson Inquiry) is that while half the press condemned her for doing anything not sweet and innocent, the other half had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBaitWait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBaitWait">countdown to her 16th birthday</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence">Evanescence</a> was originally considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">Christian Rock</a> band, and their albums sold in Christian book and music stores. Early on, they began stressing in interviews they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotChristianRock">did not want to be considered a Christian band</a>, and their label asked Christian music stores to stop selling their CDs. It was probably a wise strategy since it's unlikely an artist strongly affiliated with the contemporary Christian music scene could have sold 15 million albums worldwide.
</li><li> In general, Christian Rock bands that tour with secular bands that include anything remotely resembling strong language in their lyrics (not just profanity, but lyrics that are "too dark"), drink alcohol (even offstage) or endorse "liberal" (read: not unambiguously right-wing) viewpoints will be accused of betraying the scene/faith by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>.
<ul><li> A perfect example of this is the soul-metal band King's X, which, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotChristianRock">always denying</a> that they were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">Christian Rock</a> band, picked up a large Christian fanbase in the '90s due to their religious beliefs and their vaguely spiritual lyrics. Then frontman Doug Pinnick came out as being gay, and suddenly their fanbase condemned them as "traitors" to the Christian rock scene.
</li><li> A less extreme but still notable example is Amy Grant, who garners a lot of flack from the Christian music scene for drinking and occasionally swearing.
</li></ul></li><li> Believe it or not, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> got hit with this in 1976, when he identified himself as bisexual in an interview with <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine and basically sabotaged his status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol">Teen Idol</a> at the height of his fame. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Everything turned out okay, though</a>.
</li><li> This happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer">MC Hammer</a> when he tried to get a tougher image. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">irony</a>: earlier in Hammer's career (before the mainstream success), he <em>was</em> a hardcore rapper. He later crossed over with a more dance-oriented sound, which was given note in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IceCube">Ice Cube</a> diss track "True To The Game".
</li><li> Rapper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nelly">Nelly</a> arguably damaged his mainstream career by making the "Tip Drill" video. Before it came out, Nelly was being groomed to be like the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith">Will Smith</a> (but with more street cred), as a rapper who had mass appeal and wasn't like the other hardcore gritty rappers in the mainstream. So now there's this huge backlash and Nelly's career seemed defined by that raunchy vid. It arguably sapped his career's momentum.
</li><li> Jo O'Meara, formerly of the squeaky-clean pop group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7">S Club 7</a>, got this in 2007 when she appeared on <em>Celebrity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> and was accused of racism towards fellow contestant Shilpa Shetty. Also happened to her bandmates Bradley McIntosh, Jon Lee and Paul Cattermole while they were still in the band after they were cautioned for drug possession. Notably averted by Rachel Stevens, who has successfully moved onto her own pop career with a sexier image; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannahSpearritt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannahSpearritt">Hannah Spearritt</a>, now better known for TV's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval">Primeval</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JessicaSimpson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JessicaSimpson">Jessica Simpson</a> started out as a Christian pop singer with a clean and innocent public persona — she even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuppressedMammaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuppressedMammaries">taped down her breasts</a> for performances because her promoters felt that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">her natural bustiness</a> would hurt her good girl image. When she became a mainstream pop star, her record company convinced her to adopt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">sexier image</a>. Simpson then started wearing more revealing clothes in public, posed for magazines such as <em>Maxim</em>, and played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Daisy Duke</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em> film. The change in image from "squeaky-clean gospel singer" to "mainstream sex symbol" did not sit well with some of her fans, and she was accused by many of being a bad role model.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> has openly stated she believes in this trope and that she has a responsibility to her younger fans. Here's <a class="urllink" href="http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-60-minutes-raising-next-generation/">a clip from her interview with <img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes">60 Minutes</a></em> where she discusses it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Swift</strong>: It'd be really easy to say, "I'm 21 now. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">I do what</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maury">I want</a>.

</div><ul><li> In more recent times, though, Swift has garnered quite a bit of controversy (mostly among her own fans) for the ridiculous amount of short-term relationships she's had during the last few years. Many fans have branded her a slut — somewhat curiously, given that a repeated claim of many of her ex-boyfriends is that she <em>doesn't</em> put out.

On the more mainstream front, Swift managed to dodge the cleanliness bullet by sexing up her image so slowly that no one noticed it until it was done.

Their first two albums, <em>Hybrid Theory</em> and <em>Meteora</em>, were notably G-rated in comparison to the band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal">Nu Metal</a> peers.
</li><li> Subverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a>, whose 2013-14 period of weird tabloid antics had gotten him flak from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and late night comedians alike. To wit: getting caught leaving a brothel in Rio de Janeiro; being filmed sleeping by a Brazilian prostitute he hired; constantly missing, canceling, or showing up hours late for shows and meet-and-greets with his young fans; getting caught spraying graffiti (graffiti showing his support of convicted felon and girlfriend-beater <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisBrown">Chris Brown</a>) in Colombia; abandoning his pet monkey in Germany; desecrating the Argentinian flag onstage (an offense punishable by imprisonment in Argentina); getting into a fight with a British paparazzo; smoking marijuana; reckless driving; public urination (while inexplicably shouting "FUCK BILL CLINTON"); writing that he hoped Anne Frank would have been a fan of his after visiting the Anne Frank House, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">showing up in baggy overalls and a baseball cap to meet the Prime Minister of Canada</a>. Add the fact that Bieber is coming of age and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">new teen phenomenon</a> from across the pond has already toppled him from his throne, and it sounds like his career should be deader than dead at this point. But he eventually shook this image off and experienced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection">Career Resurrection</a>.
</li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> seem to be invoking this almost instantaneously over them following a newspaper's release of two of them smoking marijuana.
</li><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanPopMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanPopMusic">Korean</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePopMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePopMusic">Japanese</a> pop idol groups and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">idol singers</a>, at least at the start, are made to conform to the "innocent and celibate" ideal so as to act as role models and to go along with fan fantasies. That means a great outcry usually follows whenever an idol gets caught doing anything that breaks that ideal, from smoking to even just <em>dating</em>. This is also why anyone who does a sexy or rebellious concept often gets much flack from both fans and the public. Some idols get to grow out of it without much criticism, others are expected to remain pure their whole careers (even when they are in their <em>20s or near 30s</em>).
<ul><li> A particular infamous example is female Korean soloist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IU">IU</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor">"Nation's Little Sister"</a>, who received massive backlash after uploading (accidentally or not) and deleting a selfie of herself in pajamas along with a topless Eunhyuk (of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SuperJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SuperJunior">Super Junior</a>) at her house, implying not only they dated but that they had sex. She luckily managed to avert it later with her next album, which was quite successful and won back most of the public's respect.
</li><li> In 2013, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AKB48" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AKB48">AKB48</a> member Minami Minegishi was caught leaving the house of a member of Japanese boy band EXILE.

She was instead demoted to the Kenkyusei (trainee) unit. The whole thing was fairly controversial, sparking no shortage of moral debates. These days, she's pretty much back to star status.
</li></ul></li><li> Australian singer/actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonDonovan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonDonovan">Jason Donovan</a> suffered from this trope. He first was a clean-cut actor/singer who was loved by a lot of teenage girls across the world (mostly in the UK) and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol">Jasonmania</a>" began to rise. He was squeaky clean throughout his career, until 1992, when he realised that he was going too far with his innocence when he actually wanted to be "cool", and he ended up getting into a drug addiction and decided to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">a mature singer</a> by making and releasing his fourth album with Polydor called "All Around the World". To make a long story short, fans that were used to his clean image didn't like his new image. It didn't help that he sued a magazine months later for accusing him of lying about his sexuality and being a hypocrite (he was actually right,the accusations were actually untrue), thus making a majority of his fans undeservingly turn their backs at him.Thankfully, the encounter between him and his wife and the birth of his first daughter let him have a chance to clean himself up again and lead a normal and decent life.
</li><li> Similar to her ex-boyfriend Jason Donovan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue">Kylie Minogue</a> also used to be a clean-cut singer/actress, but then matured and gained a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">sexual image</a>, much to the dismay of her fans. Although, she has lead a normal and decent life throughout the 90's, unlike Donovan.

American politicians are under even more pressure to act as "role models" than actors or athletes. While most voters are willing to accept certain levels of corruption from politicians, it's only the stuff that actually comes to the forefront that ends up hurting them. Typically, the quickest way for a politician's career to be derailed is to be caught in a sex scandal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictedByPublicOpinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictedByPublicOpinion">guilty or not</a>.
<p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>, US President from 1993 to 2001, had a reputation as a womanizer (including a sexual harassment allegation) going back to his time as governor of Arkansas in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. This was used against him during his first term campaign, but not only did it fail to derail him, but it may have actually helped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">bring more attention</a> to him, as he was an unknown "dark horse" candidate. However, this reputation was a key issue that his detractors frequently used against him throughout his presidency, culminating in his second term being dominated by the reveal of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. This led to Clinton being impeached (only the second US President to have this happen to him) on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, ultimately being acquitted. <br/><br/>However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">it was largely only in the media that it was such an issue</a>. Despite the scandal and impeachment leading to Clinton being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> of countless sex jokes and late-night comics, he still maintained a high approval rating from the public, with only his detractors considering the affair to be a huge deal. In the end, he left office with a record high end-of-term approval rating, with voters viewing him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a> who left behind a strong economy even in spite of his own personal issues.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore">Al Gore</a>, Clinton's Vice President, suffered on account of his belief in this trope. Despite the fact that Clinton still was popular during the Lewinsky scandal, Gore made the foolish move of distancing himself from Clinton on account of the scandal when Gore ran for president in 2000 and wouldn't let Clinton campaign for him. This cost him voters who liked Clinton and failed to win him the ones who didn't like Clinton. This is considered a key factor in Gore losing what political experts think should have been one of the easiest presidential wins ever.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> might not have been elected US President in 2008 without this trope, as he might not have been elected to the US Senate in 2004. Obama's opponent for the seat, Republican Jack Ryan (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan">that one</a>) was ahead of him in the polls until a sex scandal involving his ex-wife, actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeriRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeriRyan">Jeri Ryan</a>, went public after their previously sealed divorce records were opened. Unlike usual political sex scandals, it wasn't an extramarital affair or an illegitimate child, but one that strictly applies this trope. Ryan had taken his wife to a bondage club several years prior and asked her to perform sex acts with him out in the open. Despite Ryan's denial and Obama asking the Democrats not to inject the issue into the campaign, the backlash forced Ryan to drop out of the race. His replacement, the fringe perennial candidate Alan Keyes, would go on to lose to Obama in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandslideElection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandslideElection">a landslide so big</a> that it gave birth to the term <a class="urllink" href="http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2005/10/lunch-discussions-145-crazification.html">"crazification factor"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11cwir');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11cwir" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11cwir');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Roughly speaking, it describes the portion of the electorate — roughly 27% of the population on either side of the political divide — who will <em>always</em> vote for their preferred party, no matter how crazy, vile, or repugnant their party's candidate is.</span>.
</li><li> US Congressman Anthony <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Weiner</a>, Democrat for New York, from 1999 to 2011, had his political career shot down after he posted a link to a sexually suggestive photo of himself on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> account. He first denied that he had posted it but later admitted that he had and that he had exchanged sexual pics and messages with at least six other women. Weiner initially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">refused to resign despite enormous pressure</a> from his fellow Democrats and President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>, only relenting after a sexually explicit photo was leaked. And then, a similar but different scenario (sexting women other than his wife) shot down his bid for New York City mayor, and his own attitude towards it has pretty much put an end to his political career (and, perhaps, his marriage). And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">Weiner</a> found himself caught in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">another</a></em> sexting scandal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">Three more times.</a>
</li><li> US Senator <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Craig">Larry Craig<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Republican for Idaho from 1991 to 2009, had a reputation as an arch-conservative, speaking out against Bill Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal (see above) and staunchly opposing gay rights. This made his 2007 arrest for lewd conduct in an airport restroom (he later plead guilty to the lesser charge of disorderly conduct) even more ironic; matters were only made worse by his attempted denial, which made the term "wide stance" a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>. The ensuing scandal forced him to choose not to run for a fourth Senate term in 2008.
<ul><li> A case similar to Craig's happened to Representative Trey Radel, Republican from Florida, who in 2013 was <a class="urllink" href="http://gawker.com/coke-busted-gop-congressman-just-voted-to-drug-test-foo-1468175133">arrested<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for trying to purchase cocaine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">not long after</a> backing a plan to make passing a drug test a requirement for receiving food stamps.
</li><li> And years before the Craig and Radel incidents; there was the case of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bauman">Bob Bauman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a former Republican Congressman from Maryland. Bauman had been in Congress since winning a 1973 special election following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">suicide</a> of predecessor William O. Mills shortly after Mills was indicted on illegal campaign contribution charges. By the late 1970s; Bauman's strongly conservative record (and helping start Young Americans for Freedom and the American Conservative Union) led to his being considered a rising star in the GOP. That is, until one month before Election Day 1980, when it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">came out</a> that Bauman (a married father of four) was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingADoubleLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingADoubleLife">Living a Double Life</a> after being arrested on charges of soliciting an underage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmouredClosetGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmouredClosetGay">male</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestProfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestProfession">prostitute</a>. Bauman blamed the incident on alcoholism and completed a treatment program upon which the charges were dropped; but his campaign never recovered and Democratic State Senator Roy Dyson (who had run against Bauman in 1976 and was given little chance of winning this time until the scandal broke) ended up defeating Bauman in what was otherwise a very GOP-friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectionNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectionNight">Election Night</a> in 1980.
</li></ul></li><li> During the 2007 Australian federal election, it was revealed that Labor candidate Kevin Rudd <a class="urllink" href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudds-strip-club-visit/2007/08/19/1187462058476.html">had once visited a New York strip club while representing Australia at the United Nations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">He ended up becoming Prime Minister anyway</a>. Given that he was generally seen as a buttoned-up and un-charismatic bureaucrat before the 'drunk with strippers' story got out, it may have actually helped him in the polls.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> is a particularly divisive example. Numerous scandals have been levied against him, some of them sex-related, but he's gained a reputation for being near-impossible to discredit with his core base of supporters, gaining him the nickname "Teflon Don" (in reference to the similarly undiscreditable Ronald Reagan, AKA "Teflon Ron" whose slogans and general imagery Trump and his supporters repurpose wholesale.). It's not helped by the fact that before he ever became a politician, he was already widely known and glamorized as a billionaire playboy, so he never really had a "morally pure" public image to protect in the first place, as well as making the complaints themselves come across as hypocritical.
</li><li> The current (as of writing) British Prime Minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BorisJohnson">Boris Johnson</a> is an example of this - his philandering has been public knowledge for decades (most famously, he was sacked from the Conservative front bench for lying to his party leader about an affair he was having with a journalist from the Spectator; he was also alleged to have been sleeping with someone that was awarded funds by the Greater London Authority while he was mayor) and he has, repeatedly, refused to say how many children he has, with the strong implication that he <em>doesn't actually know</em>. This didn't stop him from getting elected Tory leader and then re-elected as Prime Minister in 2019 however, and after the birth of his child to his now-fiancée Carrie Symonds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">the press</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12n8fs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12n8fs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12n8fs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is almost entirely, to various degrees, supportive of either Johnson or his party in general</span> immediately started gushing about how "fatherhood changes people", rather ignoring that he's been a father multiple times before.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Professional Wrestlers </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The face of WWE <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> has stated in the past that this is pretty much the sole reason that it would be difficult for him to become a villain. He enjoys the charity work that he does, and it would be difficult for him and the WWE to give it up without a replacement handy. This trope was also the reason there was such a scandal over him getting divorced from his wife. Because Super Cena isn't supposed to have marriage problems like a normal guy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Cameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Cameron">Cameron</a> frets over this on an episode of the reality show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em>. She considered getting a boob job, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst">unhappy with her current size</a>. She ultimately decided against the surgery because she was afraid it would send a bad message to younger fans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly">Molly Holly</a> speaks against this trope in her shoot interview. As she was a Christian in real life, many dirtsheets 'reported' that she left WWE because they wanted her to "play the T&amp;A card" - and apparently disliked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEDivaSearch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEDivaSearch">Diva Search contests</a>. Molly said she wasn't bothered by T&amp;A, describing it as "a part of show business". Fans also seem to forget that she still participated in plenty of bikini shoots during her time in the company. She did, however, tell WWE when they hired her that she wouldn't do risque storylines - so she was portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenWholesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenWholesome">Token Wholesome</a> amongst the other sexualised Divas.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">Lita</a> similarly may have had this trope in mind. She said one of the reasons she refused to pose for <em>Playboy</em> was because she had so many young girls as fans. Indeed many of the next generation WWE Divas cite Lita as their idol when they were younger and she reportedly would receive so many presents from fans at events that she wouldn't be able to take all them with her — so she may have had a point. Of course, she still had no problem with going out on TV with her thong showing and removing her top during matches so it's likely she wasn't that concerned with purity per se. When she turned heel on TV and became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> (including a live sex celebration on <em>Raw</em>) the majority of fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">hated her guts in real life</a> so it wouldn't have mattered what she did.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerriRunnels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerriRunnels">Terri Runnels</a> also turned down an offer to pose for <em>Playboy</em> because she didn't want to harm her daughter's reputation.
</li><li> In late 2010 WWE signed 7 ft wrestler Isis The Amazon and advertised her for NXT Season 3. When it was found that she had erotic fetish photos online, she was removed from the competition and later released.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13te93');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13te93" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13te93');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though her release was more likely due to her bitching about this openly to any interviewer who asked.</span> Ironically her replacement <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kaitlyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kaitlyn">Kaitlyn</a> also had erotic photos online and never faced any backlash from it.
</li><li> WWE seems to flip-flop on the issue of racy photos. Some Divas such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames">Mickie James</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CandiceMichelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CandiceMichelle">Candice Michelle</a> did softcore porn in the past but it never affected their standing on TV. Mickie especially was pushed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenWholesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenWholesome">Token Wholesome</a> during the PG Era (though her character did begin as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a>). Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim">Gail Kim</a> was rehired during the PG Era, despite having done topless photos for a Korean cell phone company. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie">Eva Marie</a> also worries about it on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em> when racy pictures are found from her past. Some nude selfies of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanaBrooke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanaBrooke">Dana Brooke</a> have been discovered online, but neither woman has suffered any known consequences for them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana">Lana</a> did some nude scenes and photoshoots from her modeling and acting days, but no one at WWE seems to have cared.
</li><li> Serena Deeb was abruptly released from WWE while in the middle of a red-hot storyline. The reason was that the company was annoyed at her being seen drinking and getting rowdy in public - when she was supposed to be playing a Straight Edge character on TV.
</li><li> In their 2012 shoot interview the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Bella Twins</a> talked about how scared they were of breaking PG when they first debuted. As Nikki put it, "we were like the G-girls" and said they didn't want to alienate their kid fanbase. Nikki accidentally broke PG when she did some sexy gestures coming out with Miz and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison">Morrison</a> (forgetting their entrance was in slow motion) - and was reprimanded by Stephanie. The twins eventually avoided this and became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> after their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. Nikki Bella also got breast implants, though it was after they had left WWE.
</li><li> WWE Diva <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AshleyMassaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AshleyMassaro">Ashley Massaro</a> caused a bit of a scandal in mid-2008 when she was linked with a high-quality escort service. Although she was released that year, she still appeared on TV twice after the story broke - and claimed that she had asked for her release to care for her sick daughter. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a> may have come into play - as reports surfaced that it could have been a second Ashley Massaro, a Las Vegas-based bikini model.
</li><li> WWE's policy actually doesn't mind a Diva having done racy pictures in the past - as long as said Diva discloses them to the company. However, the company frowns upon women using Amazon Wish Lists<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14v7dg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14v7dg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14v7dg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A list of bookmarked products that the user wishes to buy; it's often used by female entertainers to get fans to buy them presents</span> and grooming of male fans. It's said to be up there with public drunken behaviour and drug use.
</li><li> It was widely speculated before being flat out stated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> himself that the main reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a> was long kept out of the Hall of Fame, and wasn't asked to do one-off appearances, was because of her porn career, rather than her frosty relationship with the McMahons (especially with Stephanie, Hunter's wife). In fact, many HOF inductees don't have the best relationship with them (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino">Bruno Sammartino</a>), but Chyna was such a train wreck that not even Vince, who is always willing to put aside a grudge for the sake of entertainment, would let her anywhere near the WWE in any capacity. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">After she passed away, WWE seemed open to letting her into the Hall of Fame</a>, and she would ultimately be inducted in 2019 as part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX">DX</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly">Kelly Kelly</a> may have invoked this in order to get released by the company. She wanted to take a hiatus from wrestling, but the company would not release her. She took part in a rather racy photoshoot for a calendar and put some of the photos up on her website. The office ordered her to take them down (as WWE is PG) but she refused - and they finally released her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a> did some rather risque photos in her fitness modeling days but toned down her shoots as her wrestling career took off. Likewise, her outfits became a little more modest and she repeatedly refused to pose for <em>Playboy</em>. She's said this is because she wanted to be remembered for her wrestling rather than being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestKnownForTheFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestKnownForTheFanservice">Best Known for the Fanservice</a>. She's also said that she can be sexy with her clothes on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a> likewise says that she will never pose nude because she wants to "leave some things to the imagination."
</li><li> WWE implemented a policy around 2006-2007 stating that no talent under the age of 21 was allowed to be called up to the main roster. This was primarily in response to the antics of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly">Kelly Kelly</a> and Kenny Dykstra (19 and 20, respectively), both of whom were avid partiers at the time. While this was before the transition to PG, it nonetheless did no favors for the company's image or their characters on TV. Thus, the policy was to ensure that the talent on the road had the general maturity to rein it in and keep these things in mind.
<ul><li> About a decade later, WWE amended the policy, stating that no talent under the age of 21 was allowed to be <em>signed</em>. No official reasoning was given for the change, but it's speculated that this was in response to several older call-ups who were signed young that displayed immature behavior on the road (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas">Bo Dallas</a>). Any talent that was already signed that technically broke the rule was grandfathered.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> was caught in a scandal in early 2015 in which nude photos of both himself and NXT developmental Diva Zahra Schreiber, who was having an affair with Rollins at the time, were leaked online by Rollins' then fiancée, Leighla Schultz. Neither Rollins nor Schreiber were punished for the incident (Rollins even became WWE World Heavyweight Champion shortly after) because it was ultimately a personal matter and they weren't responsible for the photos leaking, though Schreiber was fired a few months later after fans discovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas">Nazi</a> related images on her Instagram account.
</li><li> One of the reasons why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> is considered to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/FallenCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/FallenCreator">Fallen Creator</a> in recent years. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace">All-American Face</a> of the WWF since the mid-1980s who told children to train hard, eat their vitamins, say their prayers and believe in themselves was revealed to have taken steroids for at least 15 years during the steroid scandal in the early 1990s, and was said to have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrimaDonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrimaDonna">Prima Donna</a> who buried other talents that he felt were a threat to his top spot. Then two decades later, he was caught using the N-word multiple times during a sex tape with another man's wife. Even though he got his revenge on the website that released the tape by suing them into bankruptcy, it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>; his WWE Legends contract was terminated and Hogan himself was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">unpersoned</a> in the process. Though he would eventually be re-personed three years later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> was all but anointed to succeed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> as the face of the company, much to the despair of the fans. And then he violated the Wellness Policy and got suspended. Obviously, the face of the company cannot have that kind of black mark on his record. He ate three cleans in the space of a month and suffered numerous humiliations — Rollins took numerous shots at him during his suspension while building to the Shield Triple Threat on RAW, his cousins the Usos lifted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a>, one of the men who pinned him clean, on their shoulders during Dean's celebration for his win, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a> verbally eviscerated him live in front of the entire RAW roster for losing the title to SmackDown. It's fairly obvious the company is beginning to de-push him in favor of others, and that Reigns' chances of officially succeeding Cena have gone down immensely. For what it's worth, as of Late 2017, Reigns is well on his way to reclaiming his previous spot.
</li><li> Averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai">Asuka</a>. While she has never gone as far to pose nude, she was a well-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> in her pre-WWE days, being a Gravure model, releasing a few DVDs and <em>more than a few</em> pictures, portraying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a>, kissing her fellow female wrestlers, allowing male wrestlers to grope her and even once added a stipulation to a match against Lin Bairon that the loser would have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulStrip">remove her top and bare their breasts to the audience</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note159yc1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note159yc1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note159yc1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She won but only only got as far as pulling down Lin's bra-strap before she managed to run off</span>. None of this has stopped her becoming arguably the most dominant female wrestler in WWE history.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Teachers </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The same stigma exists against school teachers; one of the first things that education programs drill into you is never to be seen doing things that your students aren't old enough to do (with the possible exception of driving a car), for fear that it may affect your credibility as an authority figure. This doesn't mean teachers <em>don't</em> cut loose of course; they're just mindful of where they go and what they post on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a>.
<ul><li> There was a story about a teacher who was fired for having pictures of her drinking wine on Facebook. Another, more saddening story was about a woman where either her insurance or disability payments were cut off because she had depression, but had pictures posted of her having fun on Facebook <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note168uf4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note168uf4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note168uf4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Depression patients are not depressed <em>all the time</em>, but tend to cycle in and out of the depressive state periodically. And even those who are actively depressed can still <em>fake</em> it.</span>.
</li><li> Something similar happened to a Florida teacher who was arrested for drinking with her husband in a bar where sexual shenanigans were going on in the back. The police dropped the charges. The school board didn't.
</li><li> A bill in the <a class="urllink" href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/02/13/423412/arizona-bill-would-likely-prohibit-teachers-and-professors-from-teaching-any-book-with-profanity/">Arizona state legislature<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, introduced in early 2012, would have made it illegal for teachers at any public schoolincluding universitiesto "engage in speech or conduct that would violate the standards adopted by the Federal Communications Commission concerning obscenity, indecency and profanity if that speech or conduct were broadcast on television or radio." In essence, if passed, every teacher and college professor in Arizona would have had <em>literal</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">Contractual Purity</a>. Thankfully, the bill did not pass, as it would ban the teaching of every novel that contained sexual situations or the word "fuck" (so all YA). On top of that, it was so poorly drafted that it would have banned the teachers from being nude or having sex in the privacy of their own houses, and arguably would have even made it illegal for them to go to the bathroom.
</li><li> In Britain at one time quite a few schools reached a tacit agreement with their older students whereby one designated pub was out of bounds to students and another was out of bounds to teachers. The legal drinking age in Britain is 18 so many older students could do so within the law, but it was also tacitly acknowledged that quite a bit of under-age drinking amongst their classmates was going to go on.
</li><li> A literal trope for many teachers at Protestant Christian schools. Many of them have to sign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">"covenants"</a> forbidding them from drinking and having sex out of wedlock. Many of them will also enforce this for <em>students</em> as well. This means that they can get in trouble for stuff they do off-campus.
</li></ul></li><li> A second-grade teacher who took a sick day appeared on Howard Stern's show in a bikini and returned to find herself out of a job due to violating a school morality code. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0627081jarry1.html">She ended up suing the school district.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Then there was the much-publicized case of a schoolteacher being found to have previously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">starred in porn</a>, with two camps cropping up - those that believed her history shouldn't be factored in as long as she was done with it, and those that believed it sapped all credibility and respect from her. Seeing as she's been fired twice since being found out the first time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">it's fairly obvious which side won out</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Voice Actors </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Lest you think this is purely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">American</a> trope, try following any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenIdol">Teen Idol</a> in Japan (even those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">grown into their twenties</a>!) and you'll see this in spades. If a girl kisses, goes on a date, or heaven forbid, admits to having sex, she is torn apart by rabid fans who are apparently so lonely and hopeless, they can only imagine younger girls as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">pristine virginal fantasy</a> and the companies also enforce rules forbidding romantic relationships whatsoever. Anything that shatters that illusion brings on their vicious ire. Yeah, you think America's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> are bad, they're still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearsTooEarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearsTooEarly">way behind</a> hardcore Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">Otaku</a>.
<ul><li> An even more extreme example is that when voice actresses were once gravure or porn actresses. The best they could receive is to have no or little future roles. On worst, it would be <em>outright ban</em> from the voice acting industry, like former voice actress Eriko Ishihara (who played Atsuko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiamondDaydreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiamondDaydreams">Diamond Daydreams</a></em>); she was banned from the voice acting industry in 2004 when news broke that she also was an AV idol while doing voice acting.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmiNitta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmiNitta">Emi Nitta</a> was attacked on the Internet, many netizens accused her of starring in AV which caused many 'fans' to burn merchandise of her and her character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LoveLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LoveLive">Honoka</a>. While the allegations were proven to be un-true, it was said that this scandal took a hit on her career.
<ul><li> Although probably there are some aversions or subversions on this, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChiakiTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChiakiTakahashi">Chiaki Takahashi</a>. All that was known in her career before hitting big as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmaster">Azusa Miura</a> is that she's a rather daring gravure idol, appearing nearly nude in many pictures of her, this is despite that Azusa is actually a character who, being an idol, adheres to the trope, and while a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>, is a little shy about her figure and would rather be caught dead than doing anything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Chiaking</a> does in real life. While she's not exactly a top-billed seiyuu, she still managed to get quite a number of roles in anime, video game or foreign dubbing at times, although usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PigeonholedVoiceActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PigeonholedVoiceActor">pigeon holed</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> characters or shows that have ecchi elements.
</li></ul></li><li> Heck, Japanese fans do this to fictional characters too. Probably the most infamous example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kannagi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kannagi">Kannagi</a></em>, where one chapter of the manga hinted that Nagi had a boyfriend once (not that she had sex, just that she was romantic with a guy). Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">angry fans</a> decrying the series and the author, saying "I don't want a second-hand wife", and the author subsequently ending the series for health reasons, which most people believe is the stress she suffered from dealing with said fans. Making it even more bizarre is the fact that Nagi is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">hundreds of years old</a></em>, and her fans are <em>still</em> outraged that she might have dated a guy at some point during her centuries-long existence.
</li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> is an exception to the rule. A seiyuu or idol can almost admit they are homosexual or bisexual and no one bats an eye at them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HitomiNabatame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HitomiNabatame">Hitomi Nabatame</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShizukaIto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShizukaIto">Shizuka Ito</a> may be this, though both eventually gotten married outside the industry.

She was dismissed from her agency when it came out that she'd been sleeping with three of her four bandmates, but she <em>immediately</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">got a new agency</a> and kept her iconic roles. She's taken a fair amount of heat for it from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">certain fans</a>, but her career is strong enough that she can afford not to care.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaraStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaraStrong">Tara Strong</a> sometimes tells the story at cons of how she turned down a role in a horror film because it would have required her to be topless for a scene, and she doesn't want her young fans (or perverts) looking up nude photos of her online. Although she doesn't object overmuch to jokes about being a "hot mom" (even by her own kids) and has listened and approved of a song saying she has a "nice badonkadonk", as well as touting vintage dresses from an LA clothier called, appropriately enough, "Stop Staring!" She also says she loved doing voices on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> because it was different from the family-friendly stuff she was doing at the time.

<ul><li> And Janet Ellis, who was <em>allegedly</em> sacked for being single and pregnant.
</li><li> On the other hand, Richard Bacon being <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blrj2JpuWMs">sacked<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after being caught taking cocaine was pretty reasonable.
</li><li> And Peter Duncan was fired for having appeared in a soft porn film. Though in this case, the adult film role in question was one that he did <em>before</em> joining <em>Blue Peter</em>; he was fired for not having revealed it to the BBC during his application (although had he done so, he would probably never have been made a presenter in the first place).

</li></ul></li><li> He was brought back for a second stint about a year later, though. His replacement in the meantime was Michael Sundin, whose brevity on the show was <em>not</em> due to having appeared in a gay porn film (he wasn't actually in any of the sex scenes). He wasn't offered a new contract for the simple reason that he wasn't very good at the job.
</li><li> Right at the very start in the late 1950's, the standards were even stricter: Blue Peter's first presenter Christopher Trace was fired simply because he was getting divorced. This was not seen as desirable <em>at all</em> for a member of a presenting team who were intended to be surrogate parents to the nation's children. This set the tone for Standards: Blue Peter presenters were held to notoriously high expectations for conduct and behaviour ever after.
</li></ul></li><li> This even happens with <em>buildings</em>.

In actuality, though, Lauren caught a serious amount of flack from viewers and the media during the third season of <em>The Hills</em> when it was alleged that she made a sex tape with Jason. This happened despite the fact that she was a mid-20's woman at that point, who had grown out of her teenage years. The negative press that spiraled out of this revelation (and the interest by the paparazzi) may have been part of the reason why she eventually left the show.

So the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> may have had a point there. Where he really was frustrated was when he got flak for doing Muppet productions that were not necessarily family-friendly, as, <em>Sesame Street</em> aside, he had created the characters to produce <em>adult</em> shows. The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em> is actually titled "Sex and Violence" (though it doesn't really have much of either.)

</li></ul></li><li> Back in the '20s and '30s, the Ford Motor Company enforced this for <em>factory workers</em>. Ford had an army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective">private detectives</a> to spy on employees and ensure that they were living morally clean, upstanding, good Christian lives, free of such sins as adultery, alcoholism, and atheism, under the belief that moral workers were more productive workers. (This is the same reason why big business generally rallied in support of alcohol prohibition at the time.) Failure to follow the Ford morality clause could get workers fired.
<ul><li> This issue was one of the (many) problems that ultimately derailed Fordlândia, Ford's attempt to build a rubber plantation in the Amazon in order to reduce the company's dependence on rubber from British Malaya. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica">conservative American lifestyle that the company tried to enforce</a> — no women, no alcohol, no tobacco, no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football</a>, and American food in the cafeterias — was so alien to the <em>Brazilian</em> workforce that a settlement called the "Island of Innocence", filled with bars, nightclubs, and brothels, developed just five miles up the river to serve the increasingly-frustrated workers (who rioted in 1930).
</li></ul></li><li> In 1983, Vanessa L. Williams was crowned as Miss America. 10 months after winning the crown, several nude photos of her (which had been taken before she became Miss America) were sold to <em>Penthouse</em> magazine, who then published them. The resulting scandal was huge and Williams herself became the target of death threats and hate mail. Eventually, she was convinced to resign as Miss America and title instead went to the runner-up. This was averted in the long run, however. As a singer and actress, she has had the most successful post-pageant career of any Miss America in the pageant's entire history and is generally the only one most people can name offhand.

</li><li> Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina is one of several Christian colleges known for having overly complex rules for its students and teachers, based on its interpretation of the Bible. Students are forbidden from listening to rock music, forbidden from having unmarried sex, forbidden from watching virtually any form of non-Christian entertainment (except for PG movies with a chaperone), and female students are required to have chaperones when leaving campus. Students have actually been expelled for criticizing the university, which has also received criticism from Christians and non-Christians alike. Similarly, Brigham Young University requires students and faculty to conform to a Mormon-influenced "Honor Code", including no drinking alcohol or caffeinated beverages<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17vznx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17vznx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17vznx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">current LDS Church doctrine interprets this to include only tea or coffee; in 2012, the church officially ruled that caffeinated sodas are acceptable</span>, no beards for men, and a vow of chastity (including a rule specifically forbidding "homosexual behavior").
</li><li> A really disgusting example occurred in Scotland in 2009, when the <em>Sunday Express</em> newspaper printed a <a class="urllink" href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Express_Dunblane_controversy">front-page attack piece<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on some survivors of the Dunblane school massacre, which had happened thirteen years before, for allegedly insulting the memory of their dead schoolmates by talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">drinking, fighting and sex</a> on social networking sites. It was suspected that the story was inspired purely by the fact that they had reached 18 and were no longer protected by Press Complaints Commission rules about intrusion into their private lives.

</li><li> This concept is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with military officers in most countries.

</li><li> For many jobs in general, you're always told that you're the face of the company that you work for, even when you're not at work. Getting into trouble with the law, doing unsavory acts, developing a substance abuse problem or even going behind the company's back to bad mouth them on social media is a quick way of getting fired.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesGunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesGunn">James Gunn</a>, before he made the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em> films, was a notoriously R-rated horror-comedy filmmaker who cut his teeth working for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Troma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Troma">Troma</a> before moving on to films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Slither" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Slither">Slither</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Super" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Super">Super</a></em>, as well as writing the script for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead2004">Dawn of the Dead (2004)</a></em>. This has followed him in two ways.
<ul><li> First, in the midst of his edgy indie days, he also wrote both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> movies, which are widely considered a textbook case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAdultery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreAdultery">Genre Adultery</a> compared to his overall body of work at the time.
</li><li> Second, in the late '00s his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> account was filled with the sort of offensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> one might expect from him given his background (jokes about AIDS and pedophilia, for example). He cleaned up his act and apologized for his older tweets once he was hired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> to work on the <em>Guardians</em> films, but in 2018, these tweets were dug up once more in a campaign to get him fired. Disney obliged, removing him from any future Disney projects such as <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em>. The backlash against Disney was swift, largely because many people saw the campaign to get Gunn fired as a hit job driven by people with questionable political motives. It was driven mainly by far-right activists led by the infamous troll Mike Cernovich, motivated largely by Gunn's criticism of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> and a belief that Disney was being hypocritical in firing Roseanne Barr from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">her eponymous show</a> for similar tweets (though Roseanne's were made as her show was on the air rather than years ago, they were part of a long, recent trend of controversial statements that didn't seem like just edgy trolling, and her apology came off to many as insincere) as well as using it to promote conspiracy theories tying Democrats to pedophilia. It wasn't until several months later did Disney and Gunn began patching things up. In the end, the campaign backfired; not only did Disney rehire Gunn (a decision that was actually made months before they officially announced it), but in the meantime, Gunn was also hired to write the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a></em> movie, largely on the strength of his fanbase pushing for other studios to hire him. Everything seems to have worked out for him in the long run, thanks to Gunn's handling of the controversy in a mature and professional fashion (swiftly apologizing and accepting full responsibility for the consequences of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">past tweets</a>, and not criticizing either his former employers or the trolls who attacked him), all Cernovich and company ultimately achieved was making Gunn look like the victim of a malicious slander campaign (and exposed Cernovich as the <em>real</em> hypocrite since he also tweeted rape jokes in the past, and was actually charged with sexual assault, while no one came forward to accuse Gunn of the same things after the tweets resurfaced, especially since the #MeToo movement made it easier for victims to come forward with their stories) and actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">doubling</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">the number of big-budget superhero productions he was working on.</a>

</li><li> In July of 2007, Sajani Shakaya lost her title as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumari_(goddess)">Kumari<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of Bhaktapur, when she visited the US to attend the movie release of <em>Living Goddess</em> (a documentary about the Kumari), because the elders claimed that her trip had "tainted her purity." (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">How and why was never explained</a>.) She was, however, reinstated a few weeks later, because she was willing to undergo a purification ceremony to cleanse her of any sins she might have committed while traveling.
</li><li> An odd example comes in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Hololive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Hololive">hololive</a>, which is a group of idols/gamers who use a Facerig-like program to stream using 3D character models. While Japanese idol culture is heavily seeped in this trope, hololive fans tend to use "<em>seiso</em>" (a Japanese word that roughly means "purity") in sarcastic, joking fashion. Some of the girls do act like traditional idols and thus try to maintain a wholesome image, but others never even tried in the first place and will swear or crack lewd jokes on stream. One member in particular, Kiryu Coco, not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot">swears like a sailor</a> (including dropping a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F-Bomb</a> from time to time) but has joked that her tail is actually just a fancy buttplug and a common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> involves portraying her as a drug dealer; she's also one of the most successful hololive idols <em>by far</em>, having a massive audience both in Japan and overseas.
<ul><li> It's to be noted that the hololive girls rarely collab with male streamers, not even their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> holostars branch, lest they face backlash from very devoted fans. Not that it hasn't stopped Fubuki or Matsuri from collabs anyway.
</li><li> On the other hand, there are a few examples of hololive playing this trope depressingly straight.
<ul><li> Tokoyami Towa ended up getting briefly suspended after male voices could be heard in the background of one of her streams (she insisted that they were hololive staff members playing tech support) and had to apologize when she returned.
</li><li> A bigger example came from Mana Aloe, who accidentally doxxed herself during a test stream and was likewise suspended. Unfortunately this lead to trolls and anti-fans harassing not just her, but her family and a man who was believed to be her real-life boyfriend, with some indication that the harassment happened because she had exhibited "un-idol-like" behavior (such as making sexual jokes) on one of her pre-hololive video accounts. After the suspension period ended, it was announced that Aloe would be leaving the group because of the harassment, though the one faint silver lining was that Cover Corp (the heads of hololive) announced that they would be more aggressive in protecting their employees from harassment from then on.

Since then, they've had as squeaky-clean a relationship as you can think of, never even kissing, and having a long-distance relationship in which they barely saw each other.

</li><li> An interesting example happened in the 12th season of the Spanish series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CuentameComoPaso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CuentameComoPaso">Cuéntame Cómo Pasó</a></em>. Back in the first season, six-year-old Ricardo Gomez was cast as 8-year-old Carlitos, and since the series has been on air for over 10 years, the now 16-year-old actor is playing an 18-year-old character who had to become sexually active as it was necessary for the series to reflect the Spanish "destape" age. A few people in Spain thought it scandalous when Carlitos and his girlfriend had sex. The scene was filmed overhead, so the nudity was minimal, but some people admitted to being uncomfortable watching the children they had seen grow up on TV having sex. However, the controversy in Spain was still relatively small compared to what one can imagine would have been the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> outrage if something like this had happened in the US.

This poses something of a problem for Jenna since she does have a habit of getting into shenanigans and freaky sex, but then, she reasons, she can always do that in private. Her problem is that her boyfriend Paul is a "gender-dysmorphic bigenitalian pansexualle" who, long story short, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">dresses up as Jenna for a living</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork">beat her in a Jenna Maroney lookalike contest</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> when the president of the wool trade group and his wife come to dinner, and Jenna and Paul are trying to act normal...

As it turns out the man is not at all into S&amp;M - he was an important executive and upon retirement or death, his company owed him over 100 million dollars. The man who first found him was one of his coworkers. He dressed the body in the latex costume and called the dominatrix in order to later invoke the morals clause of his contract and void the payout. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ironically, the victim absolutely was violating the clause, just not because of any taste in S&amp;M - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">he was sexually abusing his own son, who killed him when it seemed like his tastes might wander to his younger brother.</a></span>

He notes that talent agencies have morality clauses which allow them to terminate an idol's employment if she's caught dating someone, a fact which forces idols to keep their relationships (and other vices) secret for fear of being fired. Mr. Producer himself nearly fires Julie after discovering that she engages in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompensatedDating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompensatedDating">Compensated Dating</a>, only for her to talk him out of it.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars">Ensemble Stars!</a></em>: as all of the main characters are idols, they will be expected to remain single to appease their fans as long as they are performing. Kaoru, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker">The Slacker</a>, mostly tries to ignore this and flirts with girls a lot anyway, but <em>Love Comedy</em> finally brings up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheRoom">Elephant in the Room</a> with Rei confronting him about the matter and forcing him to choose between his current carefree lifestyle and the serious requirements of being an idol. Kaoru ultimately decides to put his womanising on hold and wait for the day he and Anzu can be together if she will have him. (On a lighter note, in the same story Tomoya expresses a bit of envy that Kaoru even could be associated with such a scandal - he'd <em>like</em> to be considered cool and mature boyfriend material, but fans of his unit only ever seem to find them all cute...)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, which prominently features the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> Rise, brings this up from time to time.

If the player does get into a relationship with Rise, she still keeps it under wraps, despite being fairly openly flirtatious toward him, possibly because of this trope. She also discusses this trope if you talk to her while wearing your Featherman costume, saying that the stars of the show have to lead decent private lives, so as not to ruin the image kids have of them.

</li><li> The main six from <em>Recess</em> caused a scandalous incident when they went to a restaurant and ordered alcoholic beverages (and they were able to get them because T.J. explained to the waiter at the restaurant that they were nine in 1997 so they were born in 1988 and could legally drink; however, those characters in the fanfic are under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a> and are still nine), and a little kid found them, noticed that they're the ones he saw on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD">Disney XD</a> and told his mom as they watched them drunkenly sing the Texas song.
