<ul><li> In the first volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em>, Kuroyukihime is trying to find out the identity of the Burst Linker who's hunting her for the point bounty. Her initial choice is Haruyuki's long-time friend Chiyuri, considering that the Burst Linker is someone with access to the Umesato school network, and that Chiyuri was fairly hostile toward Kuroyukihime in their first meeting. Of course, Haruyuki knows Chiyuri isn't a Burst Linker, since he describes her as unable to hide her feelings and terrible at video games, and the truth is that the actual culprit used a backdoor program in Chiyuri's neurolinker to access the Umesato network.
</li><li> The setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> is a walled city that very few ever leave. So when Armin tells the other children about a vast "ocean" of saltwater that exists outside the walls, they are skeptical. Such a big amount of salt <em>cannot</em> exist, their reasoning goes, because if it did then merchants would have taken it to sell. They have no way of understanding just how big an ocean is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>, Moritaka Mashiro assumes that his uncle, Nobuhiro "Taro Kawaguchi" Mashiro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">committed suicide</a>, since he'd been unemployed for a while after the cancellation of his last series, and he was deep in debt (It didn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotGetTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotGetTheGirl">the girl he'd had a crush on</a> moved on and married someone else before his debut). In reality, Nobuhiro had overworked himself while trying to get serialized again, and Moritaka's father (Nobuhiro's older brother) points out that Nobuhiro wasn't the type to give up and kill himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuGirl">Boku Girl</a></em> is about an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady">androgynous boy</a> named Mizuki turned physically female for the amusement of trickster god(dess) Loki. Outsiders who learn Mizuki is female but do not know about the gender bending take his declarations of being male as something along the lines of Mizuki being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a>. On the other hand, Mizuki's crush Fujiwara, who is unaware of the gender bending but does know Mizuki was originally male, comes to the opposite conclusion and thinks Mizuki is male-to-female.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, in the manga, just before Waku's battle, the pilots enter Zearth's cockpit and try to find out where their seats are, which is fairly easy for most of them, since the chairs are replicas of the ones they sit in at home. Since Maki's adoptive parents will give birth to a boy soon, Maki assumes that the crib belongs to her, rather than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">Chizu</a>'s unborn baby(who technically counts as a pilot)</span>, and sits there, rather than the chair she initially assumed was hers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>, the magic side <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">hates and fears Touma Kamijou</a> because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Imagine Breaker</a>. After finding that Touma has made "alliances" with several powerful people from both the science and magic sides, they conclude that Touma is building an army to take over both sides, calling this army the "Kamijou Faction" ("Kamijou Forces" in the English dub). They couldn't be more wrong, Touma has no interest in taking over anything and only wants to help and protect people. These powerful people are mostly members of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a>, and most of them are unaware of magic and Touma's adventures.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>'s Red Ribbon Army arc, when the Red Ribbon leaders observe Goku apparently leaving the site of the next Dragon Ball, Adjudant Black, on the (Very accurate) theory that Goku must have gotten his Radar from someone else, suggests that he's going back to that someone for help. A scout is sent to follow Goku, and sees him talking to an old man. The Red Ribbon then makes the very <em>inaccurate</em> conclusion that the genius behind the Dragon Radar is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Muten Roshi</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>: Erina Nakiri admires Joichiro Saiba as the ideal chef, and somehow has convinced herself that he is a perfectionist who does not admit failure, even denouncing Soma Yukihira's trial-and-error approach as "things losers make up to cover their failures". Little does she know, not only Joichiro does not believe in perfection like she does, but he's also Soma's father and <em>raised</em> him to be that way in his cooking. When she does eventually find out the truth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">she flips out as she relises that she has been belittling the son of her idol all along</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GakuenBabysitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GakuenBabysitters">Gakuen Babysitters</a></em>, Ushimaru believes that Ryuuichi and Imomata are dating after seeing him give Imomata chocolates on Valentines Day. In reality, Ryuuichi was simply thanking Imomata for helping in the daycare.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GrannyGirlHinataChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GrannyGirlHinataChan">Granny Girl Hinata-chan</a></em>: Side chapters that take place when Hinata was a baby feature her brother Haruto noticing odd behaviors from his newborn sister. These behaviors include folding origami cranes in her crib, confirming with a clear nod they're to wish their mother a speedy recovery from her birth, never crying at night until her mother expresses worry about it, looking embarrassed when she does cry at night, reciting the Japanese alphabet, and stopping as soon as she realizes Haruto has noticed. Haruto takes this all to mean that Hinata is simply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainyBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainyBaby">Brainy Baby</a>. The real reason is that Hinata is the reincarnation of an adult who has retained her intelligence and memories of her past life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/IAmBehemothOfTheSRankButIAmMistakenAsACatAndILiveAsAPetOfElfGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/IAmBehemothOfTheSRankButIAmMistakenAsACatAndILiveAsAPetOfElfGirl">I Am Behemoth Of The S Rank But I Am Mistaken As A Cat And I Live As A Pet Of Elf Girl</a></em>: The entire population believes Tama is an Elemental Cat, not a young Behemoth. Even if Tama could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless">tell them the truth</a>, he won't because his life depends on the misunderstanding.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>: Miko has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of walking in on the other Student Council members during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">Not What It Looks Like</a> situations (like mistaking Kaguya's attempts at giving Shirogane a perfectly innocent massage for them having sex), which leads to her believing that the the male members of the council are sexually exploiting the female members. In Chapter 80 Miko's friend Kobachi points out how wildly out of character that would be for everyone involved and encourages her to re-examine the facts. Miko heeds her advice, but instead comes to the conclusion that <em>Kaguya</em> is the one sexually exploiting the boys.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LetterBee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LetterBee">Letter Bee</a></em>: During Episode 42 of the anime, Lag notices that Calibus Garrard and Hazel Valentine are searching for Gauche, and fearing that they will interrogate Sylvette, decides to impersonate her, with Niche disguising herself as Sylvette's wheelchair. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garrard and Valentine, who are actually Marauders infiltrating the Bee Hive, then abduct Lag-as-Sylvette. Their plan is to use "Sylvette" as a hostage to lure out Gauche/Noir so that they can kill him, then dispose of "Sylvette" once she's no longer useful</span>. After Lag and Sylvette reveal themselves, Valentine assumes that Lag did this because he'd figured them out, but Lag replies that he only wanted to protect Sylvette. In fact, Largo, who's smarter than Lag and has a better intelligence network, only realized <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that Valentine and Garrard were Marauders after they'd left with Lag</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em>:
<ul><li> Characters outside of the main cast are under the impression that Kobayashi is Kanna's mother. This is not an unreasonable assumption. Kanna lives in Kobayashi's home, goes by "Kanna Kobayashi" at school, and Kobayashi <em>is</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> to Kanna. Further, Kobayashi doesn't really argue against the description, even as she's shown to dislike it, and she herself notes she's old enough that some of her classmates have children of their own. The full truth is that Kanna is an exiled dragon child that Kobayashi took in because she had nowhere else to go. Kanna's best friend, Saikawa, does note that Kanna calls her mom "Kobayashi" and refers to their maid as "Lady" Tohru, but is so overwhelmed by Kanna's cuteness that she never pursues this line of thought.
</li><li> Taketo misinterprets the kind of person Kobayashi is due to Ilulu giving him information that is wildly out of context, which only gets worse when he meets her for the first time and sees what appears to be her forcing Ilulu to act like a dog.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a>, Todoroki observes that Midoriya and All Might have very similar Quirks, and that All Might gives Midoriya more attention and mentoring than the other Class 1-A students, which leads him to the conclusion that the two are father and son. His logic is sound given what he knows, but he <em>doesn't</em> know that All Might's Quirk can be deliberately passed on and that he's chosen Midoriya to be his successor since he's near the end of his career, all of which are closely-guarded secrets.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Bakugo</a>, having known Izuku since they were both kids and having a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a>, assumes that Izuku was hiding his power their whole lives, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">disregards</a> Izuku's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredConfession">confession</a> that he was recently given his Quirk.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">.. that is, before the circumstances surrounding All Might's retirement lead Bakugo to put two and two together and deduce the truth.</span>
</li><li> In an anime-only episode, a group of students have to solve a mock murder of a villain, played by All Might, killed by one of his hostages.

Big Mom's children all assume that the cake <em>must</em> be poisoned and, when Big Mom reaches it, they can only pray that both the poison fails to work and the cake tastes good in spite of it.

What the Big Mom pirates don't know is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sanji led the cake's creation, the idea of poisoning food, even an enemy's, is unthinkable to him, and he managed to convince the allies delivering the cake to leave it alone</span>.

Circumstances changed this to "Save Sanji's family from Big Mom's assassination and maybe kill her too" and teamed up with Capone "Gang" Bege to accomplish this. While the rescue worked out, the assassination failed and the heroes were forced to fight their way out, and along the way Big Mom's palace was destroyed due to an outside factor Luffy was only tangibly connected to.

A solid idea, since women wouldn't be able to infiltrate the barracks directly and the men typically don't handle their own laundry. What they don't realize is this man <em>does</em>, in fact, do his own laundry. They would never have seen his uniform if the other soldiers hadn't sent his to be washed without telling him first.

<ul><li> Kaiba created the Duel Disk for this reason. He realized that Pegasus had some kind of way to read his opponent's strategies, and deduced that it was some kind of tell-spotting technique, that Pegasus had some kind of well-honed way to, at close range, read an opponent's body language and facial expressions and figure out their thoughts. Hence, he invented a dueling machine that positioned the opponents a good distance apart, and put a bunch of giant holographic cards and monsters in between them. Unfortunately for him, he didn't realize at the time that Pegasus's powers work through straight-up magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindReading">Mind Reading</a>, and though it does have a range, it's a lot longer than the distance the Duel Disk works at, and therefore none of this would matter even if he ever got the chance to use it.
</li><li> In the anime, after Pegasus and Kaiba dueled, Tristan and Tea (English dub) decided to investigate the duel arena in the middle of the night because Pegasus pulled off a bunch of moves that weren't possible unless he somehow knew what cards Kaiba was going to play in advance, so Tristan climbs up to the platform and holds up a card like he was dueling, and the two teens notice a beam of light on the card coming from behind. They trace the light to window overlooking the arena and presume someone with a telescope could be broadcasting instructions to Pegasus through an earpiece hidden in his hair, allowing him to cheat. While this isn't the manner in which Pegasus was cheating (he was using mind-reading which is still the same as looking over the opponent's shoulder), ironically, this "strategy" is precisely the trick a contestant in the Battle City arc used to scam victories. Joey Wheeler, already knowing how the trick worked was able to fool the "psychic" duelist and get him off his game to squeak out a victory.

</li><li> Speaking of Tonks...after Harry encounters Tonks inside Hogwarts, he speculates to Ron and Hermione that Tonks might have been in love with Sirius, the reasons being that: (A) Tonks was nearly in tears after Harry mentioned Sirius' name, and (B) her Patronus resembles a four-legged entity nowadays. Near the end of the year, Tonks confesses her love for everyone within earshot (including Harry) to hear, prompting Harry to realize that he was right about Tonks being in love; he was mistaken only about with whom she's in love.

</li><li> An example occurs in the very first book, <em>On Basilisk Station</em>. The climax of the book is a fight to the death between a Havenite Q-Ship and Harrington's very-much-outgunned light cruiser. The battle breaks out because Harrington has figured out Haven's plan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to use a native insurrection and attack on humans, including Havenite traders, to act as an excuse to launch a military occupation and seize the system, and that the Q-ship is supposed to be an "innocent trader" that goes running for "help" from a waiting invasion force,</span> and so she has to stop it before it can. All of which is completely true, but circumstances are such that the plan has been shot to hell and the Havenite captain is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> running to tell the waiting invasion force to <em>not</em> to launch the invasion</span>.

Albrecht's surprised because they actually <em>didn't</em> have anything to do with that one. They just helped it along when they realized it was occurring.

They had earlier covered up the destruction of one of their secret facilities by claiming that infamous Manticoran and Havenite spies had assisted local terrorists in a bombing that killed a large number of civilians and died in the blast. The fact that those spies had needed a long time to get home so they could report in supported their belief that the two were dead. Not only was Mesa wrong about this, but the fact that they're alive to now dispute their claims makes them an even bigger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a> than they would've been otherwise.

So when the vaguely androgynous one eyed dandy answering to Captain Portree emerges from the cockpit, Ari (a giant of a man clearly capable of snapping most humans in two) rises to his full height and makes it clear that the twerp's continued well being is wholly conditional on the ship's prior owner being produced alive and well.

They don't have the concept of science and their latest information on humanity is at least several centuries old, which is completely up-to-date by demon standards.

Uniquely among guardians of the Baudelaires, Monty correctly places Stephano to be not what he seems, as he has no real knowledge of reptiles, constantly acts shifty, and tries to interfere with Monty's work, and guesses that Stephano is a spy sent to steal his discoveries before he can present them in an upcoming event. However, Stephano is actually Count Olaf, who doesn't care at all about Monty except as an obstacle to reaching the Baudelaires.

From all this he comes to the conclusion that Jon Arryn was murdered by Cersei and her brother Jaime because Jon had discovered that her children were the product of incest, and they tried to kill Bran because he saw them together.

The first is that it's later implied that it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joffrey, the oldest of Cersei and Jaime's children</span> who sent the man with the knife to murder Bran because he had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">heard Robert call Bran's paralysis a horrible fate and say that Bran should receive a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a></span>, and the second is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cersei and Jaime had nothing to do with Jon Arryn's death, it was actually Lysa acting under Petyr Baelish's orders, and the letter was meant to throw everyone off their trail and sow distrust between the rival houses</span>.

Khabarakh maintains that he had used that month to meditate over his failure. Thrawn, still suspicious, has his ship thoroughly examined, and finds Wookiee hairs all over. He concludes, quite logically, that Khabarakh had in fact been held on Kashyyyk for the last month, and has him taken into custody on suspicion of treason. Unfortunately for Thrawn, the conclusion was wrong: Khabarakh's story was true, and the Wookiee hairs <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">were all from Chewbacca, who had been aboard the ship (and had helped with a bit of cover-up sabotage to it)</span>.

</li><li> Thrawn's major piece of missing information was something only a handful of people alive were aware of: Leia was Vader's daughter. The Noghri could determine that by her smell, and that relationship gave "Lady Vader" influence with them, enough for them to talk. Had he known that, and knowing Vader's reputation among Noghri, he might have realized why they were so "unsuccessful" in hunting her down.

A lot of the fun comes from Jake trying to understand the story he's being told and formulating theories based on knowledge that often has yet to be fully expanded on. An early example from the first episodes has Jake hear how Riku is swallowed by the darkness, followed immediately by Sora's pulling the Keyblade from the darkness, and posits the question "Is <em>Riku</em> the Keyblade?" This is proven wrong when Riku becomes a major character in the story not too long after. Yet even when these guesses are wrong, Shannon often concedes that the ideas Jake suggests are the kinds of things <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> probably <em>would</em> do.

</li><li> The very first thing Ellen notices on meeting Diane is an uncanny resemblance to Susan. As the story continues, Ellen and Nanase discover Diane was adopted as an infant, was born approximately twenty minutes earlier than Susan, happens to have the exact same magical affinity as her, and was protected by an immortal who had vowed to be Susan's ally. Ellen and Nanase reach the conclusion that the two must be related, as does Diane when she gets enough pieces to put together. Their initial idea that the pair might be twins separated at birth is debunked by Tedd's father, but Susan's father was "a cheating cheater who cheated" on Susan's mother, opening the possibility of being half-sisters. It is eventually revealed that they <em>are</em> related, but more distantly than anyone considered. Their familial connection is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Adrian Raven, a teacher at Diane's high school. He's an elf, a half-immortal, who's lived for centuries believing he couldn't even <em>have</em> children.

</li><li> One piece of evidence that Ellen and Nanase present to Susan when telling her about Diane for the first time is that Jerry, an immortal sworn to be Susan's ally, appears to believe it's true. He helped Diane while claiming it was due to a debt "to her sister", while doing nothing to help Diane's adopted sister, Rhea. Because Jerry is an immortal, a magical being with the power to travel invisibly and see much more than a mortal would, Susan takes this as conclusive evidence that they are sisters. Unknown to any of them, Jerry is in the room, invisible, and noting that he doesn't actually know any more than anyone else does.

The girl, Agatha Clay, studies at the local university under Dr. Beetle: if she were a Spark, all her professors would know. The soldier, Moloch von Zinzer, only just came into town. What the Baron and Gil don't know is that you <em>can</em> hide "the Spark": Agatha had been wearing a device that does exactly that. Of course, since Klaus leaves early, he misses the big clue of the Clank going off to "protect" Agatha, leading Gil to do the sensible thing — check their hands, revealing that the soldier's hands are clean... but Agatha's have grease and oil on them from building the clank. Which leads Gil to come to the conclusion that Agatha is breaking through <em>now</em> due to the stress in her life. Once again, somewhat wrong: she broke through when she was <em>five</em>, and the same necklace that had hidden her was acting as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a>.

Dale's vision tells him, in pretty unambiguous terms, that his son Joseph was actually fathered by a Native American man. But instead of finally piecing together the many obvious hints that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyKnewAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyKnewAlready">John Redcorn is his son's biological father</a>, he becomes convinced that <em>he</em> is actually a Native American. Eager to throw him off, John Redcorn agrees with him, and Dale spends the rest of the episode hilariously trying to "reconnect" with his Native American roots.
</li><li> Dale does this a lot when it comes to Joseph. For instance, he once figured out that nine months before Joseph was born, he was halfway across the country chasing a UFO sighting. He comes to the only obvious conclusion, the aliens impregnated Nancy because they knew Dale was onto them and wanted to distract him! He later "remembers" that the aliens abducted him and said it was likely that they harvested his sperm to impregnate Nancy with, and therefore Joseph is biologically his son after all! However, it's implied that he made up that last part to make Joseph feel better since he was going through an identity crisis after "learning" that he was half-alien.
</li><li> For Dale being Entertainingly Wrong in the <em>other</em> direction on his family tree, his own father (who he believes is a real ladies man) attempted to come out to him as gay. In his awkwardness, he merely said to Dale that the rodeo he works at is a gay rodeo, and that his friend that Dale met earlier is his partner. Dale is disgusted, telling his dad to get out of his sight. After all, his dad obviously just confessed to being a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscriminateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscriminateAndSwitch">government agent</a></em>, the natural enemy of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> like Dale! Why <em>else</em> would he be working at the gay rodeo with a "partner"? They must be undercover! Of course, when it's all straightened out (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamePunReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamePunReaction">ha ha</a>), Dale is perfectly accepting of his dad's sexuality.

</li><li> Peggy Hill often gets hit with a case of this as well, either due to her over-inflated ego or whenever her (in)ability to speak Spanish comes up. In one episode, she came to the conclusion that the actor who plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Monsignor Martinez</a>, whose children she had been tutoring, was in love with her.

However, he was just poor with English. What he meant was that his wife went to visit her <em>grandparents</em> and the flowers and gifts were a surprise for her when she got back.

The reason for this belief was that the human heart is connected to all parts of the body through veins, and a quickened pulse preceded strong emotions. For this reason, the heart was preserved when someone died and was mummified. Meanwhile, ancient Egyptians believed that the brain was only responsible for creating mucus, so they just threw it away. This is also the source of using hearts to represent emotion, making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>.

</li><li> A lesser known real-life example occurred when Atahualpa, the last Inca emperor, heard about the Europeans approaching the Inca capital of Cuzco. He noted that the Europeans had cooking pots (metal helmets for protection) over their heads. Atahualpa believed that anyone who wore cooking pots was crazy, which goes double if they didn't even use those cooking pots for preparing food!

</li><li> Wilbur Wright declared out of frustration that man would never fly... a solid <em>day</em> before <em><a class="urllink" href="http://0.tqn.com/d/inventors/1/0/W/7/1/WB1903Flyer.jpg">this happened<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></em>.

Dec</a>'s entire worldview was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">completely wrong</a>, but some things stand out. For example, he claimed that the Polish Christmas tradition of <em>kolęda</em> — children going from house to house dressed up as devils and angels and singing Christmas carols — is actually a leftover from ancient (reality note: nonexistent) religion of Astrocism. This is especially jarring to someone who took part in <em>kolędas</em>.
</li><li> People once believed tomatoes were poisonous, being related to deadly nightshade and <em>actually</em> making people who ate it seriously sick. Both of these were true. However, the true culprit was the <em>lead plates</em> most people ate the tomatoes off of; while lead plates aren't a generally good idea, the real problem was that tomatoes are acidic enough to <em>dissolve</em> the lead off the plates, assimilate it and transport it into human biology.
</li><li> Potatoes were also once considered to be heinously poisonous. This is because they actually are... if you eat the leaves. The <em>tubers</em>, on the other hand, are perfectly fine as long as they're not too green. On that note, Tomatoes and potatoes are actually closely related and both within the <em>Solanum</em> genus.
</li><li> Many of the educated people who have developed pseudoscientific theories and/or reject accepted scientific consensus do so because they take facts they know and extrapolate them to a completely wrong conclusion, unaware that there are facts they don't know and that what they do know is often a very simplistic explanation useful for teaching students or the public <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesToChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesToChildren">but useless for detailed study of the topic</a>.

</li><li> While most people when traveling to a foreign country <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">might inadvertently assume things work the same</a> as they do back home, this proved deadly in the case of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/search-and-rescue/the-hunt-for-the-death-valley-germans/">four Germans on a family vacation to the southwest of the United States, in 1997<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's believed that what caused them to come to a slow death in the desert were a series of logical but fatally wrong assumptions. They underestimated how rough the roads can be, might not have fully realized just how serious of a situation they were in 'til it was too late, and, most notably, it seems that they saw a military base on a map and assumed, based on their experiences in Europe, the base would be fenced and regularly patrolled. Seems like pretty sound logic unless you are in any way familiar with US desert military installations, which are seldom fenced and almost never patrolled, as the vastness and inhospitably of the terrain is adequate security.

</li><li> Plato believed that the Sun was a living being: according to him, the fact that it moves, and moves on such a consistent schedule, meant that it had to be intelligent. He also argued that it was probably some kind of deity: after all, it's a perfect and unmarred sphere, and it clearly has great power. (Obviously, the technology to reveal the existence of sunspots was a long ways away.) In general, it was very common for early astronomers to assume that celestial bodies were perfect in form and shape, which was part of why the invention of telescopes (which revealed that many of them had craters, rings, spots, or objects orbiting them) proved very controversial.
</li><li> The site <a class="urllink" href="https://www.iusedtobelieve.com/">Iusedtobelieve.com<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is full of weird things people believed as kids. The interesting thing is: many of the misbeliefs make sense even if they are wrong, such as one kid thinking only the most beautiful girls in the world would become prostitutes, as why else would people pay to have sex with them? Or things like thinking weather forcasters have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> and that's how they could predict the weather ahead of time.
</li><li> The cure for scurvy became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> for a period in the late 1800s because of this. Expeditions that were rich in lime juice (supposedly the perfect cure) ended in scurvy, while expeditions that had the crew eating fresh meats didn't. This led to many doctors and scientists claiming that scurvy wasn't a dietary problem, but rather, a form of food poisoning of unknown origin (possibly resulting from bacteria, which had been newly discovered at the time) that occurred in contaminated meat, especially when dried or preserved. After all, voyages that ate nothing but fresh meat were fine, and voyages that ate nothing but preserved meat got scurvy, so the "lime juice" cure was probably just a primitive and unproven superstition of the sort that were getting knocked down left and right in the era. In reality, scurvy is the result of Vitamin C deficiency, and said vitamin is common in... pretty much any kind of fresh food. If you eat a fresh apple or lemon or steak on a somewhat regular basis, then you can wash it down with as much dried meat as you please and never risk scurvy. The problem is that Vitamin C breaks down pretty quickly when exposed to the environment, so heavily dried or processed food tends to not carry any, and most expeditions intended to subsist entirely off dried and processed foods. This is also why lime juice stopped working; initially, lemons were used, but limes were cheaper, despite containing much less Vitamin C, and the process of juicing limes and pumping the juice around in copper pipes for months on end would destroy what little was left.
