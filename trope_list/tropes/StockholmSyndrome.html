Especially if said captor provided them with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment that the captive, under extreme stress, exaggerates as a genuine sign of affection.
</p><p>This can develop in kidnapping victims, political prisoners, and prisoners of war, or hostage situations when there is a long standoff with police (like the ever-popular bank robbery situation). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers">Or</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">very unhealthy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense">marriages</a>. It has even been known to happen in prisons between prisoners and wardens. It's named after a robbery that took place in Stockholm - employees at a bank were held hostage for six days, and some of them ended up defending the robbers afterward.
</p><p>In stories, any time a captive comes to love their captor, the Stockholm Syndrome trope is in play. Many of these stories feel forced, starting with captivity and jumping straight to love. The most realistic depictions of Stockholm Syndrome in this manner of the story include not only the kindnesses, but also the extended time needed, and clear isolation from outside influences.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>, this is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Takaoka</a>'s "9 sticks to 1 carrot" training strategy invokes. Students become so scared of falling to the bottom of the hierarchy that they suck up to the teachers who put that hierarchy in place, even bullying their fellow students in a desperate attempt to establish a dichotomy.

It is a very popular view in fanon that she has Stockholm Syndrome for Ulquiorra, and in some cases, even Aizen. At the least, she does show some compassion towards Ulquiorra <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as he's dying.</span>
</li><li> Berwald/Sweden and Tino/Finland's relationship of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> may qualify for this trope, as Finland wasn't exactly the most willing partner at first (read: was downright terrified of Sweden), and despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">warming up to Sweden</a> and acknowledging he's not a bad guy, he still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">denies that they're married</a>. Amusingly, Stockholm is the capital of Sweden... and in a subversion, Sweden is actually portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a>-type nation-tan in the strips, instead of your typical captor.
<ul><li> Considering how their relationship is shown in the comics, if Tino has Stockholm Syndrome, then Berwald in parallel has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome">Lima Syndrome</a>. He might have started thinking of Finland as a mere companion for his journey, then became genuinely fond and protective of him.
</li><li> And what about Italy/Germany? Okay, they're allies for most of the series, but their first encounter was Germany taking Italy prisoner during WWI. And Italy was completely okay with it, more than usual.

This one is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">highly unusual example</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Viletta is normally an ambitious, cut-throat, Japan-hating Purist, but getting shot by Shirley caused her to develop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">Easy Amnesia</a>. Ohgi found her and, not knowing who she was (other than Britannian), took care of her and treated her kindly. As a result, "Chigusa" (as she started calling herself) fell in love with him. When Viletta regains her memory, she shoots Ohgi in the gut, saying that the idea of being an Eleven's lover makes her want to vomit</span>. In the second season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's seen visibly struggling with the conflict between her old attitude and her feelings for Ohgi as an individual. They end up getting together, but not before committing a few acts which set the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> fandom up in arms.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OkaneGaNai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OkaneGaNai">Okane ga Nai</a></em>, Kanou buys Ayase as a slave to work his debt off, even though he's fully aware that rape is <em>not</em> something you do to the one you love (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeMaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeMaleOnMale">except in fiction</a>). Ayase is understandably terrified of Kanou at first and views him as the one ruining his life, but becomes touched by Kanou's small moments of kindness and even defends him to his brother "because he's kind." Keep in mind that even <em>after</em> Kanou allows Ayase to do such things as going to school, he still pretty much controls every aspect of Ayase's life and continues to rape him just to remind him that he belongs to him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou">will not give him up to anyone else</a>. If that isn't Stockholm Syndrome, then nothing is.
</li><li> Komari from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GokujouDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GokujouDrops">Gokujou Drops</a></em> has to endure quite a bit of sexual abuse from all the girls at her dorm. This is especially the case with Yukio, who also adds an immense emotional element to this. Of course, this leads Komari to fall head over heels with Yukio over time. It <em>seems</em> to be mutual, but since Yukio has the habit of crushing Komari's feelings over and over, it's hard to tell for sure.

He is then treated worse than a dog, forced to sleep on hay, regularly beaten for the slightest bit of pervertedness, and just generally treated like dirt. This is all done by his master Louise, who he comes to love. In his defense, he does get treated better as time passes by, but still... oh, and there are also the hints that the familiar contract may involve subtle brainwashing too.
<ul><li> Somewhat deconstructed in the novels, though. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's confirmed that Saito's mind was being altered, repressing his feelings of homesickness and every bad thought he could conceivably have about Louise.

Interestingly, the series implies that this is intentional on Keith's part, as a means of inspiring Matsuka to protect him during the war against the Mu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and setting Matsuka up to fulfill Keith's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">death wish</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">killing him in self-defense</a> when the war is over.

He probably is, and the fact his employer is willing to write him off as dead rather than lift a finger to help him pretty much cements it. By the time the crisis is resolved and his employers say they'll take him back now, it's pretty well set and he tells them to shove it, he's sticking with the pirates (but keeping his white shirt and tie).

John is abducted and held captive for 18 months by a firefighter-obsessed madman who tortures and rapes him. John eventually becomes a willing participant in the guy's sex games because the torture is too much to bear, and he's treated kindly and nicely when he complies. He knew he was being raped and used, but he knew that "playing nice" and willingly complying felt good and the torture hurt so much. After snapping, killing the guy, and escaping, he struggles with the good feelings and erotic dreams he has, amongst his hatred and fear. A psychiatrist eventually lays out for Roy (John won't go) how the guy was John's only human contact, and how the good and evil acts are seperated in the victim's mind and the good ones clung to like a lifeline. The love isn't normal or healthy but it is strong. The information persuades John to see the doctor himself.

<ul><li> The first was a Senju warrior whom the female Uchiha Head of the Outgard decided to abduct and forcibly bed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">flirting with her on the battlefield</a>. The poor guy tried to escape several times, but ultimately resigned himself to be a male concubine. The Uchiha clan acknowledges it was rather skeevy and not very nice for the Senju.
</li><li> The second is Senju Tobirama briefly given as a hostage to the Uchiha clan to ensure a truce. Tobirama <em>is</em> deeply aware he won't be as effective as a fighter against the Uchihas if he continues to interact with them in a <em>friendly</em> context such as watching the kids or discussing fuinjutsu, but can't do anything to reverse the process. The Uchihas being much more supportive and understanding towards his mental trauma than Tobirama's own brother doesn't help either.
</li><li> The third is Kakuzu of the Waterfall, who tried to assassinate one of Konoha's founders only to be imprisonned and exiled in absentia by his clan for his failure. He was left so traumatized by his elders' betrayal that Uchiha Sakurajima swooping in to seduce and ultimately marry him met no resistance whatsoever.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> when the news report is discussing Stockholm Syndrome and suggesting the hostages are entering the first stages the camera pans to the hostages watching a corpse being dragged past them and are terrified of rather than identifying with their captors. Interestingly, the psychiatrist, the author of a book on the subject, refers to it as Helsinki Syndrome, suggesting that he either got his facts wrong or is ripping off Stockholm Syndrome (if the former case, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to clueless pundits). Amusingly, the male newsreader tries to clarify to the viewers that he's referring to "Helsinki, Sweden," and is quickly corrected - Helsinki is in Finland.

The captive is stage coach robber Ben Wade, who is never really a prisoner in the movie. He demonstrates the capability to escape any time he wishes, but sticks around because of an interest in Dan Evans that developed before he was even taken 'captive'. Wade is a badass cynic who grows increasingly fascinated with Evans' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> idealism which is uniquely motivated by his own cynical perspective. In the end he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">helps Evans deliver him to the train, despite having an entire town gunning for him. Of course, he had already escaped Yuma prison several times. In fact when his gang kill Evans, a furious Wade guns them down. And then he gets back in the train, and lets it take him to prison.</span>

</li><li> Captain Hook in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook">Hook</a></em> deliberately tries to induce Stockholm Syndrome in Peter (Pan) Banning's children, in part by posing as the good, caring, attentive father that Peter wasn't. It works on his son Jack, but not his daughter Maggie, and even Jack gets set straight when he realizes his father <em>does</em> loves him and that Hook is a murdering asshole.

</div></li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnQ">John Q.</a>.</em> had this. Because of the title character's sympathetic ordeal (Trying to get his son a much-needed heart transplant), beating up a man who was abusing his girlfriend in the middle of the situation and letting the sickest people go without hesitation, everyone was laughing and joking with him near the end, even the guy he beat up. Even the people he let go only had nice things to say about him.

Naomi believes that Allison is falling in love with her hillbilly captors due to Stockholm Syndrome, and Allison <em>is</em> slowly falling for Dale. The twist is that Tucker and Dale aren't her captors â€” they rescued her when she almost drowned. And Allison is interested in Dale because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>.

It gets a little confusing, because at first she says "These are my people" - but then, when her stepbrother sneaks into the Comanche camp to rescue her, she is happy to see him and wants to leave immediately. Of course, that could be because the Wayne character now wants to kill her (believe her to have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever">"defiled" by Indians</a>), and her stepbrother (who is one-eighth Indian himself) has sworn to protect her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contagion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contagion">Contagion</a></em>, Dr. Orantes is eventually kidnapped by one of her colleagues who takes her to his village so that they will be among the first to get the virus vaccine. The vaccine is developed three months later, after which we see Orantes happily working as a schoolteacher for the village children and willingly cooperates with the kidnappers in the exchange for the vaccine. Later on in the airport, she is informed that the vaccine given was actually a placebo. The last we see of her is her running away from the airport, presumably to warn the villagers.
</li><li> A non-romantic example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagdaleneSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMagdaleneSisters">The Magdalene Sisters</a></em>. Margaret finds the laundry's back gate left open and walks out, even stopping a man on the road for a lift. However she decides not to get back in and returns to the laundry. Viewers have debated over whether or not this is loyalty to the other women (she was taking care of the unstable Crispina) or fear of the outside world. Given that she'd seen another escapee physically dragged back into the laundry by her family, it's entirely possible she felt she had nowhere else to go.
</li><li> This is discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorribleBosses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorribleBosses">Horrible Bosses</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorribleBosses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HorribleBosses">2</a></em>. Kurt and Dale start to bond with Rex, but Nick tells them that they have Stockholm Syndrome: a mental condition that makes a hostage become obsessed with their captors. However, Kurt and Dale point out that Rex <em>is</em> the hostage so it's actually "reverse Stockholm Syndrome".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0rwvb');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0rwvb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0rwvb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This condition also exists, though it's called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome">Lima Syndrome</a>.</span>

None of the historic figures seemed to mind being abducted by two nutty teenagers. They all eventually it as the "excellent adventure" through time that it is.
</li><li> Given Westley's story to Buttercup in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>, his relationship with the Dread Pirate Roberts (or rather, the man he assumed was him) was both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome">Lima Syndrome</a>. Roberts spared Westley, keeping him around (often reminding him of his threat to kill him, but never making good on it) and in the meantime, Westley was able to learn swordplay, fighting, and anything else the pirate crew would teach him. Eventually, Roberts, who had clearly taken a liking to him, revealed the secret behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">his title</a> to him, and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passed the Torch</a> to Westley.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs2">The Smurfs 2</a></em>, Grouchy claims Smurfette's bonding with the Naughties is "a classic case of Smurfholm Syndrome".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneIdentity">The Bourne Identity</a></em>, possibly. The book has definite elements of this trope, but then the book is almost entirely different from the film. There does come a point in the film where Bourne forces Marie to stay with him. He had offered her a way out before but now leaving his company would get them both killed. It is only after this point the two end up in bed together. The pair had built up a relationship before coercion had come into play, so it seems that Stockholm Syndrome is only part of the reason for Marie's feelings, if it's a factor at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transcendence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transcendence">Transcendence</a></em>, Max is kidnapped by RIFT and held hostage for months, but he eventually comes to agree with their views if not necessarily their methods. It helps that he was already wary of Will's new existence to begin with, though they might have won him over sooner if they hadn't tried to murder Evelyn right off the bat.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CabinByTheLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CabinByTheLake">Return to Cabin by the Lake</a></em>. After Stanley takes over the production on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmWithinAFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmWithinAFilm">Cabin by the Lake</a></em> under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation">his JC Reddick identity</a>, he rewrites his interactions with Mallory in the previous film as if she starts desiring the serial killer who repeatedly abducted and tried to drown her. Allison later pretends that she's fallen for Stanley, but it's just an act to play to his ego and try to escape.

</li><li> Parodied in the Spanish Comedy, <em>AcciÃ³n mutante (Mutant Action)</em> after Patricia has been kidnapped by the eponymous terrorist organization and traumatized in every way you can think of, she starts to shout her support and quote their dogma, even while being dragged through the dirt. Lampshaded by her kidnapper, RamÃ³n, who finds it all very annoying and keeps trying to explain to her that she has Stolkholm's syndrome and she'll hate him the next day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BerlinSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BerlinSyndrome">Berlin Syndrome</a></em>: Clare seems to be suffering from a bit of this at times, as she becomes friendly with Andi and even has sex with him after he starts holding her captive. It's unsurprising, since she's also probably desperate for any affection in the situation, plus she'd felt attraction toward him before. Likely the source of the film's name.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CryBloodApache" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CryBloodApache">Cry Blood, Apache</a></em>, Apache woman Jemme is abducted by the gang who murdered her tribe, as they believe she can lead them to gold.

You can't help but sympathize, despite what she did to Katie, knowing that she's probably been utterly broken and brainwashed by her experience.

Of course, the fact that Paris was the most handsome man of the time himself probably helped him kidnap her in the first place.

</li><li> Central to the concept of the Dick Francis thriller novel <em>The Danger</em>, the author's clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">extensive research</a> providing a more nuanced portrayal than usual of the syndrome.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> book, Holly develops enough of an attachment to her captors (the title character and his associates) to object to her allies' plans to bio-bomb Fowl Manor after her rescue. Although her objections are partly due to Artemis being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid">Just a Kid</a> and his servant Juliet being a relative innocent, her friends dismiss it as "just Stockholm Syndrome... you'll get over it."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimNewman">Kim Newman</a> short story "Who Dares Wins" refers to Stockholm Syndrome, but since the captors are vampires, they have faster and more reliable methods to get the hostages on their side.
</li><li> An unintentional example, as the term didn't even exist at the time, is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSheik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSheik">The Sheik</a></em>. The heroine is abused and raped by the Sheik until she falls in love with him.
</li><li> Done intentionally in John Ringo's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars">Council Wars</a></em> series. The lead villain, known as Paul, sets up a harem where he keeps kidnapped young women, for the express purpose of breaking them and inducing Stockholm Syndrome. The repeated rapes and hopeless nature of life in the harem inevitably take their toll on the captives. This is even explained during a short story at the end of <em>Emerald Sea</em>. It is partially averted in the character of Megan, Paul's latest victim. Despite falling in love with him, she ends up killing him partway through <em>Against the Tide</em>, in a particularly brutal and grisly manner.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, Elrond and Elros's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome">reciprocated</a>) love for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Maglor</a>, who took part in the slaughter of their people (twice) and took them captive, could be interpreted that way. Then again, most annals say they were 5 at the most when captured.
</li><li> Kobo Abe's <em>The Woman in the Dunes</em>. An entomologist plans to spend the night at the sand-pit of a widow. She and other villagers hold him in. He tries to escape and fails, and gradually develops a very sexual relationship with the woman. Years later, the man has a chance out of the pit, but he cannot bring himself to leave.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> has the damane. Women channelers (a.k.a. sorceresses) are captured by the Seanchan Empire, collared with a device that doesn't allow them to do any kind of channeling (or anything else) without their handler allowing it. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> for the women channelers raised in cultures where they are allowed to roam free and are even admired and feared. But some captured do develop an attachment to it (attachment meaning completely assuming whatever identity the handler wants them to have, resisting capture, and being terrified and traumatized if set free). Although that is more a case of actively breaking the spirit of the captured women and turning them into obedient puppets, more like pets or tools than human beings. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> indeed. This trope is averted rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">horribly</a> with Rand's capture by the hands of Elaida's Tower embassy.

His parents quickly lawyer him up and get the DA to offer an immunity deal for any crimes the kid helped the serial killer commit. However, after the serial killer is cornered by the cops and offs himself, Holmes realizes that the kid was the one in control almost from day one, being a sociopathic genius and master manipulator (he managed to trick Holmes). Thanks to the immunity deal, he's free and clear (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until Holmes manages to find a loophole in the wording of the deal</span>).

She was spared by the thug who killed her whole family, for what are implied to have been paedophilic reasons. She convinced him that she had Stockholm Syndrome for long enough that he taught her to fight... until she thought she'd learned enough, at which point she killed him.
</li><li> A mild version on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>, when Carol is taken hostage during a convenience store robbery. As one of the gunmen rants about having killed a man, she tells him that she knows how he feels, having done the same thing a few weeks earlier (she gave a patient the wrong blood) and successfully talks him out of killing another hostage, even placing herself in between the two, indicating that she knows he won't shoot her. When he takes her with him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">Human Shield</a>, he acquiesces to her request that he release her once he makes his escape. Then when they're confronted by a cop, she screams at him not to run, knowing the police will shoot him, and when they do exactly that, she goes into panic mode, frantically trying to resuscitate him and even comforting him. His last words are to ask if she's okay, indicating that he himself developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome">Lima Syndrome</a>. While it might not be love, they clearly bonded and she's visibly torn up by his death.

The man had brainwashed the kid into believing that his family was either dead or no longer loved him. When he's reunited with his mother and sister, he's downright horrified and screams at them to get away from him, not believing that they're his relatives. He spends the remainder of the episode shunning them, and even as his kidnapper is convicted and taken away, he <em>still</em> wants nothing to do with them.

She never released him from his bonds, however, and eventually, it sank in that she was never going to. What made this even more humiliating - for Graz'zt - is that when they finally did come to blows, she came closer to killing him than <em>anyone</em> had (or has since).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SunTzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SunTzu">Sun Tzu</a> advises invoking this trope on POW <em>as a matter of standard policy.</em> Because it works often enough to be worth the effort. That's one reason why, to this day, POW are still treated very nicely, at least in Geneva-compliant countries.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> is a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norrmalmstorg_robbery">bank robbery/hostage incident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that occurred in Stockholm in 1973. The hostages, among other things, berated the police for endangering them by trying to stop the robbers by force, raised money for the robbers' defense lawyers, and even wrote the robbers letters while they were in jail.
<ul><li> The robbers were committing this robbery as a form of political protest and explained their reasons to the hostages without exerting undue violence. The hostages may have been won over by their politicas, and at any rate found out those were not brutal criminals.
</li><li> It's complicated. The syndrome has been criticized by the former hostages, particularly Kristin Enmark who calls it "misogynist". In her memoirs she says that she did not sympathize with the robbers at the time but was merely trying to survive, and her behavior was due to seeing the disorganized and careless police operation (including uncontrolled gunfire and filling the bank vault with gas) as the biggest immediate threat to her life. She did later have a romantic relationship with one of the robbers, and stated that he apologized for his actions, unlike the police. On the other hand, the robbers have said in interviews that the calm behavior of the hostages at the time made them feel more sympathetic and less inclined to hurt them, which might mean that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimaSyndrome">Lima Syndrome</a> has a stronger basis in reality.
</li><li> Further compounding this is that the Prime Minister of Sweden told the hostages, point blank, that they should prepare to die at their posts. And the person who coined the phrase was the Psychologist in charge of the negations and made it to explain why this hostages weren't praising his actions. Long Story short, the hostages trusted the hostage takers a lot more than the police and for very good reason.
</li></ul></li><li> A historical example: Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, financed much of his campaign against England by taking English knights hostage and ransoming them back. He treated them so well that many would lose the will to fight against him when they were released.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> ordered that all prisoners of war were to be treated humanely. As a result, many Hessian prisoners taken by the American rebels were surprised at how well they were treated and did not try to escape. Some defected to the American cause, and after the war ended, and they were released, many chose to remain in America and become citizens. The fact that there was still cheap land and relative social mobility for many of the second sons and lower classes whose only recourse in the old country was joining the Army helped.
</li><li> Many commentators suggested that this the reason why Jaycee Lee Dugard did not try to escape, even after her kidnappers Phillip and Nancy Garrido allowed her more freedom in their house, until her rescue in 2009, along with her two daughters (ages 15 and 11) fathered by Phillip. A letter that she wrote to her captors that was read during the sentencing phase of their trial, however - read by her mother, because she was unwilling to appear in the courtroom in person - seemed to <em>completely</em> rebuke this theory. Jaycee clearly hated their guts, wishing them "many sleepless nights" and saying "There is no God in the universe that would condone your actions." She also voiced her distaste for this hypothesis in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C520Vwryn6s">an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

And Stayner actively sabotaged every other kidnapping his abductor attempted in order to spare other children his fate, even returning the one child that he did snatch, something he would have never done had he developed the syndrome. </span>

Mary."</a> Which is especially odd because unlike some other cases where this happens to this degree of severity, McElroy was only kidnapped for about a day, and during the trial had some difficulty even recognizing who her kidnappers were. Her note also makes no sense, of her four kidnappers only 3 had been found and tried, and none of them were given the death penalty, and in fact one had been released by the time of her suicide.
</li><li> In BDSM culture there's a mental state called "subspace". Basically, subspace is a temporary state of Stockholm Syndrome where the submissive partner is extremely susceptible to any suggestion on the part of the dominant partner.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29u9i');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note29u9i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29u9i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Of course, this version is a deliberate, predetermined goal between two consenting adults rather than a response to being kidnapped or imprisoned. </span>
</li><li> There are multiple historical accounts of white women who were kidnapped by Native Americans during raids on settlements subsequently resisting being taken back when their menfolk came to rescue them.
<ul><li> And it happened the other way around with Pocahontas.
</li></ul></li><li> People in abusive relationships will often develop paradoxical attachments to their abusers, believing that their actions are provoking the abuse and that they deserve it, or that the abuse is just another way of expressing affection, or that the abuser is the only one capable of loving them. The abuser will constantly reinforce these beliefs and will attempt to isolate the victim from anyone who might point out the fallacy of this reasoning. "The cycle of abuse" often begins with an abusive parent-child relationship, where the victim never learns to distinguish affection from abuse because they always occur together. Because the victim has no frame of reference for healthy relationships, they are more likely to end up with an abusive partner as an adult and are less likely to be able to raise their own children to recognize and respond to abuse...setting up to a quarter of the next generation up to follow the same path. Though we should stress, most do realise just how screwed-up their upbringings were and try to move past them. Whether or not they feel able to raise kids of their own without screwing them up too is another matter.
</li><li> Stockholm Syndrome is a great tool for pimps and human traffickers. Many lure their victims into a life of forced prostitution and sexual slavery by making their victims completely dependent on them. When the pimp has secured a victim's love, he will gradually increase the emotional and physical abuse. The victim's emotional dependence on their pimp is an important factor in making it frustratingly difficult for parents, police or social workers to rescue the poor girls. The street term for a pimp's most loyal and trusted prostitute (i.e. the one with the biggest case of Stockholm Syndrome) is, "bottom bitch." She's his willing enforcer and lookout, often venting her suppressed suffering and frustration on the other women.
</li><li> The book <em>Loving to Survive</em> suggests Stockholm Syndrome as an explanation for why women in patriarchal countries still fall in love with men, despite this being irrational as men are very likely to hurt them. This phenomenon is related to the one described above; girls are taught to expect men to be abusive.
</li><li> Patricia Hearst was captured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists">Symbionese Liberation Army</a> and then joined them in committing other crimes. Her defense team claimed she was purposely brainwashed beyond the point of being responsible for her own actions, while prosecutors alleged it was a genuine case of Stockholm Syndrome and she was still fit to stand trial. Most of the researchers who have since analysed the case believe she was in fact brainwashed, which contributed to President Carter's decision to commute her prison term, and President Clinton's decision to grant her a full pardon.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2013/04/mohamedou_ould_slahi_s_guantanamo_memoirs_part_3_a_detainee_describes_his.html">This excerpt<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the diary of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a longterm prisoner at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, described his falling prey to Stockholm Syndrome and hating himself for it at the same time.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Perdicaris#Perdicaris_incident">Perdicaris incident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which an American man and his son were kidnapped by the Moroccan bandit Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni. Perdicaris came to admire Raisuni, saying, "I go so far as to say that I do not regret having been his prisoner for some time... He is not a bandit, not a murderer, but a patriot forced into acts of brigandage to save his native soil and his people from the yoke of tyranny."
</li><li> It could be argued that military basic training is effectively this. Recruits are isolated from outside contact, punished for the smallest infraction and then rewarded with not being punished. They are effectively conditioned to trust the group they are in, and only the group. This may be why so many services veterans have mental health issues and find it hard to function when discharged. On the other hand, a lot of militaries don't reenlist for this very reason (in West countries like the USA at least). Commonly, the difference between a 4-year term and 20-year one (which would include 4 reenlistments) is the member's first NCO. If the NCO makes a member's life hell, they probably won't reenlist, but if the first term is somewhat pleasant, it's likely the member will stay until they can get full retirement benefits.
