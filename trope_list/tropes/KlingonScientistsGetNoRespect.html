However, someone has to put on the "hat-maker" hat for the rest of the society to be able to wear their chosen hat. After all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Klingon warriors</a> will need scientists to design their weapons and starships.

</p><p>It's not just a case of where someone takes on a thankless job because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneHasToDoIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneHasToDoIt">Someone Has to Do It</a>, this trope is about culture. The Klingon Scientist is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">ostracized</a> for having talents outside of what is approved by the culture, even though their talents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutRescuesTheyDontLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutRescuesTheyDontLike">allow their culture to function</a>. Klingon scientists might even agree with Klingon values — although their combination of vital importance and low social status would certainly lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses">Jade-Colored Glasses</a>.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">warrior culture</a> may disdain the blacksmiths who make their weapons. A society of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRaceGuy">pure thinkers</a> may consider all engineers to be menial laborers putting their high thoughts to work. A people of artists could see those who produce their art materials as unskilled proles. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TribeOfPriests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TribeOfPriests">race of clergy</a> may look down on the builders of their houses of worship. And yes, a race of scientist could even look down on the brutish military who keep their society safe. The low-status communities in question might despise the mainstream right back, but, again, they might not, and all of them probably need people who get rid of trash and keep the environment clean. If this trope is part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity">Vetinari Job Security</a> will kick in when the oppressed Hat-Maker takes a holiday.

Some more idealistic caste systems value (or claim to value) anyone who devotedly fulfills their ordained role, whether that means being a great artist or a great street-sweeper — just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">don't try to be something you're not</a>. Others clearly place the castes in a hierarchy: not only are warriors in general better than merchants, the worst warrior is better than the best merchant, simply by lucky accident of birth.
</p><p>Compare to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardOnSoftScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardOnSoftScience">Hard on Soft Science</a>, where certain fields of study are mocked by more "serious" areas that may very well be connected or derived from them.

</p><p>In the real world, this is fairly common, especially in premodern times. Universities, for example, were started largely with the aim of studying theology, with the natural sciences being a vaguely complementary supplement. Craftsmen were seen as inferior to farmers, as unlike farmers they merely "reworked" what farmers produced. Merchants were largely considered inferior to everyone since they were seen as producing literally nothing and making profit. This stigma was, in fact, one barrier to industrialization in many places, since the classes with the most potential to produce productivity gains were socially discouraged. While this has subsided, to a large extent, it is still enough to say that <em>every</em> society has had at least one job that is looked down upon by the culture at large while still being entirely necessary for that society to function.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>, dwarves value blacksmithing and mining above all other professions. Senshi's seen as an oddball at best for eschewing those in favor of hunting, cooking and farming.

Unfortunately for her, the Demon tribes are mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">proud warrior races</a> and she's thought of as one of the weakest Demon Kings ever. Even though she <em>did</em> acquire the job <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">in the traditional manner</a>.
</li><li> The fourth squad of soul-reapers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> are in some ways the most essential, since they heal the wounds the other soul-reapers incur through constant fighting. They are even the ones in charge of washing uniforms, resource logistics and maintenance of infrastructures. However, because they are usually not very skilled at combat, other squads tend to pick on them. This trend is averted with their Captain, who can make even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">squad 11</a> settle down just by giving them a <em>harsh glare</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out that she was the original Kenpachi, meaning she was universally recognized as the most dangerous Shinigami in existence, and the founder of the squad 11.</span>
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>: the Zentraedi are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> to the point that warfare is literally the only thing they ever do, so one would think that any non-fighter among them would get this by default. Nonetheless, they seem to hold their noncombatant strategists in high regard, and even the highest-ranking commanders are usually shown listening intently to what their adviser has to say. However, the Zentraedi manage to avoid the whole deal with scientists/engineers by having all their hardware built by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">perpetually functioning, self maintaining</a> satellite factory left behind by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrecursors">the ancestral race who created them,</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAgeStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAgeStasis">having virtually no advancement in tech levels for centuries at all</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>: Hayato Maeda/Chumley Huffington is going to Duel Academia to learn how to be a card designer, which is an important role since they're the ones maintaining the development of the game. Nevertheless, he's in Osiris Red (making him a social pariah by default), and even was held back a year, all because he himself isn't a very good duelist. Granted, part of it seems to be more his attitude than anything else and one does need to have an udnerstanding of the rules to design cards.
<ul><li> Noticeable in the fiftieth episode as he wins a card designer contest with his card "Ayers Rock Sunrise." He needs to undergo one more test against his professor. He goes all out and uses his own card no less. While he does not win (despite being pretty darn close to), he does go with his professor's blessing sicne the whole point was to test his mettle. He's more confident when we see him in future episodes working with Pegasus.
</li></ul></li><li> It's mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> that the prevalence of superheroes has lead to ordinary cops getting a bum rap. While this is more justified than most examples — legally, cops can't use their powers even if they have them and are consequently useless in most villain takedowns — it's easy to forget that the cops are still the ones responsible for actually enforcing the law and deciding which cases do or do not require superhero intervention. For the record, All Might, the world's greatest hero, doesn't share this sentiment. In the first episode he tells Midoriya that becoming a police officer is an admirable path to take, and that no matter what the public thinks they're just as noble and trustworthy as anyone in the hero community.

One guild, the Golgari Swarm, are basically the recyclers of the world, using their knowledge over life and death to clean up messes, recycle organic waste and provide food to the lower classes of Ravnica.

<ul><li> Under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Horde</a> the scientists were given some grudging respect because Moldrock was intelligent enough to understand they made all their weapons and the spaceships they needed to conquer the universe, but still treated them as second-class citizens due their inability to fight.

It comes to full fruition when he introduces Shepard to his crowning achievement, Grunt, who is not only genetically engineered to be the perfect Krogan from Okeer's perspective, but emits an airborne pathogen that will interact with the Genophage in any Krogan Grunt encounters and then spread; it does not affect the reduced birthrate, but makes it far less traumatic and changes the gene structure of the surviving offspring to prioritize intelligence and other traits. He leaves it in Shepard's hands with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>: Either keep Grunt asleep in his statis tube or destroy him and continue to watch the Krogan walk a path to self destruction, or release him and eventually subject the entire Krogan race to genetic manipulation on an unheard-of scale to make them the race a millennia-old extremist would have them become. In short, because science was not respected by his race, his drove his race to the brink of extinction then held out a half-treatment that would <em>force</em> them to respect it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse">Star Trek Expanded Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Just as in the TV series (see the Live-Action TV section below), Klingons actually don't act this way in the novels; more often, the trope appears in connection with humans making wrong assumptions about them:
<ul><li> In the <em>Day of Honour</em> novel <em>Treaty's Law</em>, a farming planet was disputed between Klingon and human colonists. As part of the Organian Peace Treaty, it was agreed that the two groups would compete and whoever got the best harvest would win the planet. The humans were complacent because of this trope, assuming war-obsessed Klingons would be poor farmers, but it turns out that farmers are actually highly respected in Klingon society and they ended up winning.
</li><li> In the first <em>Captain's Table</em> novel, Kirk says that the phrase "Klingon Research Facility" causes him to have the mental image of a Klingon warrior trying to split the atom with a bat'leth.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMFord">John M. Ford</a>'s pre-<em>TNG</em> Star Trek novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFinalReflection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFinalReflection">The Final Reflection</a></em>, the main character, a Klingon captain called Krenn, obviously respects his scientist first officer and describes Sciences as "an honourable career" to a young Spock while on a diplomatic mission to Earth. This is influenced by the Original Series Klingons' portrayal as a hostile authoritarian culture somewhat resembling the old USSR — and the USSR had its own successes in science.
</li></ul></li><li> There are a couple of genuine examples, though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>:
<ul><li> in The IDIC Epidemic, a Klingon engineer is in a weird mix of working for the Empire and exiled for being a mere nerd. He is naturally part of the cure for said epidemic.
</li><li> In one novel, a Klingon refugee mentions that he had served a tour of duty in the Klingon Navy as a drafted engineer, but all battle glory earned on his ship (against pirates, not the Federation) tended to be assigned to the officers and those who worked directly with the weapons systems. And G'Dath was a <em>really</em> good engineer — the book is about him inventing a drive system the size of a basketball so powerful that if it had been in use at the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, they would have gotten back from the Delta Quadrant in a matter of <em>hours</em> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He was eventually forced to turn over the device and all the plans to the Organians to keep his drive from destabilizing the balance of power.</span>)
</li><li> This comes up all the time in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekKlingonEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekKlingonEmpire">Star Trek: Klingon Empire</a></em> novel series. Among the crew of the <em>IKS Gorkon</em>, we find a doctor who is reviled by much of their society for recognizing that warriors without missing limbs and debilitating scars are more effective than those with them. Her suggestion of an artificial limb for her captain is outright refused (he's not a Borg, after all) and the compromise of an arm transplant from his dead father, while accepted by the captain, is looked at with horror by others. We also have the chief engineer (Kurak, referenced in the page quote), forced into the military by her family over her objections that designing better ships and weapons <strong>for</strong> the military is a better use of her talents. She's told that if she refuses to serve, she will be discommendated, which would ban her from working on those designs anyway. One novel also features another Klingon engineer, who's absolutely terrible at being a warrior (or tough in any way). However, he's a capable engineer, although the others sneer at his constant attempts at treating every engineering problem as a foe to be defeated.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is played straight by the Talarians in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTyphonPact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTyphonPact">Star Trek: Typhon Pact</a></em> series. The Talarian genders have very different social roles, and are liable to underplay the importance of the other gender's work. Given that politics and leadership is a male role, this is most notable and extreme when the male government neglects their people's feminine sphere, leading to unrest in one novella. The Gorn seem to have shades of the same problem; emphasizing the warrior component of their culture and disregarding the equally important non-military aspects. In their case, rather than a gender division it's a matter of caste; the Technologist caste appears to be looked down on by the warriors. As an interesting extension of the idea, the Political caste seems to have such fear of the warriors' tendency to promote themselves above other Gorn that they've deliberately undercut their power by giving them only a single breeding world.

The shlubs who do whatever work can't be done by slave races are at the absolute bottom of the totem pole. Telepaths are an odd case. On one hand, they are as remote from the perfect warrior image as possible: weak, neurotic, with matted fur. On the other hand, everybody recognizes their high value for the society. In the end they are tolerated, they get away with behaviour that would cost another Kzin his life (or at least his ears), but they are not promoted to higher positions. Low-status Kzinti don't even have <em>names</em>, and are instead referred to by their job title, rank, or MOS. Higher-caste Kzin get a partial name ("Chuft-Captain"), and actual nobility get the honor of having a name that's exclusively theirs with no reference to their job. No explicit word on how they distinguish between the guys on different shifts/watches who perform the same job. Oddly enough, the Patriarch of Kzin is always called that or "The Patriarch", which would seem to be a rank/job title.

There are problems for those like Aldrea who want to step outside their gender's role, but a few years into the war there's an idea that a good warrior should also have rounded skills, and by the main events of the series there are a few female military cadets as well. Part of what brings about this change is the invention and wide implementation of morphing technology. Traditionally, males have larger tail blades, the primary Andalite warrior weapon, so it wasn't feasible for women to be in combat. However, with the advent of morphing technology (and better weapons and spaceships, too), tail blades aren't the only weapon, or even the most practical, paving the way for females to become more accepted as warriors.

Some of the Scientist and Technician castes get a little respect but only if they're involved in developing and maintaining the Clan's military apparatus, or for the Scientists helping maintain the Clan's genetic selection process, and even that is rather grudging. The rest of these castes and the Merchant and Labourer castes get no respect at all. A few Clans have better, more inclusive attitudes — but others look upon the "lesser" castes with everything just short of hate.

As such, they have no idea how to do anything but fight, and consider it beneath their dignity to do anything else anyway, and when they're separated from the craftsmen (Nadraks) and peasants (Thulls) they almost starve to death until they discover the concept of slavery. In Cthol Murgos, every Murgo man is a soldier, every Murgo woman is a baby factory, and everyone else is A. not an Angarak, and B. a slave.

<ul><li> The Vorin religion teaches that the afterlife is a massive war to reclaim Heaven, so the highest Calling is to be a soldier. But of course, soldiers need food and supplies, so the priests are quick to assure everyone that farmers are <em>almost</em> as honorable as soldiers. Actual scientists are a bit of an oddity; the only men who are allowed to learn sciences are ardents, slave-priests exempt from the normal gender rules. While the Vorin do appreciate what their ardents and women provide, there is a very strong focus on sciences that can be applied to warfare.

This means that everyone who isn't a warrior or a reaver is looked down on in their society, including both the large population of thralls that grows their food and mines the iron that makes up their weapons and the farming societies they raid, despite the fact that Ironborn society is utterly dependent on these two groups in order to keep itself going. Fishermen are the sole exception, considered upstanding Ironborn presumably since they still make a living at sea. This also extends to Lord Rodrick Harlaw, nicknamed the Reader, an Ironborn lord more concerned with reading and collecting books than pillaging. He's looked down on by most other lords because of this, except for a few aware of how valuable his knowledge and advice can be.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">trope namers</a>, Klingons generally aren't portrayed this way. They don't care what you do, so long as you treat it like a fight and find a way to use it to put the hurt on someone:
<ul><li> In one episode of <em>DS9</em> we heard a snippet of a Klingon science vessel's log where the captain spoke of winning battles against ignorance, and bringing home vast spoils in the form of new knowledge.
</li><li> In the <em>DS9</em> episode "By Inferno's Light", Worf is forced to fight several Jem'Hadar in a row, all brutal hand-to-hand fights to the death. Bashir treats his injuries between each fight as best as he can, and Martok vows to write songs about both Worf's combat prowess <em>and</em> Bashir, "the healer who bound the warrior's wounds so he could fight again!"
</li><li> Membership in the staff of a Klingon Great House also seems to convey a certain measure of prestige and respect; Worf's childhood nurse once reflects sadly, but a bit boastfully, on how she was a servant of a proud and strong family, and a Klingon woman vying for control over her house seems to take the advice of her majordomo seriously (he in turn being a social intermediary between her and others, and a general face for the House's standing).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> episode "The Augments" a Klingon doctor and medical researcher finds a cure for a bioweapon that is being used dishonorably by his superior. He considers himself being executed for delivering the cure to be equivalent to a warrior sacrificing himself to win a great battle. The idea seems to make him very happy.
</li><li> The video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BirthOfTheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BirthOfTheFederation">Birth of the Federation</a></em> indicates that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Klingon blacksmiths are held in high regard</a>, as without weapons, there is no war.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandfather">Worf's grandfather (also named Worf)</a>, seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry">Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</a></em>, was himself a lawyer, and according to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> gained numerous ranks and honors through his legal acumen. (He's a colonel in the film; novels mention he attained the rank of General through his legal kickassery.)
</li><li> <em>DS9</em> features a Klingon restaurant where the owner will play the concertina <em>at</em> patrons. Aggressively.
</li></ul></li><li> In fact, most of the times this trope appears in connection to Klingons, it's actually humans <em>expecting</em> Klingons to act this way - sometimes getting disabused of the notion:
<ul><li> <em>Deep Space Nine</em> gave us a (villainous) Klingon Lawyer, who saw the court as his battlefield, and was apparently well regarded for it, as he tells Sisko when Sisko attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoke</a> the trope to rile him up.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "Suspicions" has the Klingon scientist Kurak, mentioned in the page quote. Dr. Crusher theorizes that her status as "not a people person" is due to being mistreated and disrespected by her own people, though she admits that this is just a guess.
</li><li> B'Elanna Torres, the half-Klingon main character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a>,</em> is portrayed as being torn between her two cultures. As a Starfleet engineer, she is quite respected. Problem is that she is half-Klingon, and her focus as a Starfleet officer leads her to being dishonored for <em>not</em> being a Klingon <em>ANYTHING</em>. By not embracing her Klingon heritage and bloodline, she risks sending both herself and her mother to Gre'Thor (Klingon Hell). Sins of the Child, as they put it. So while she gets respect for being a Klingon Engineer by Starfleet, she gets no respect by Klingons for not being Klingon. But late in the series a Klingon captain tells her that as the ship's engineer she keeps it in battle ready condition, so every battle the ship has ever won is her victory.
</li></ul></li><li> There are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">occasional examples</a>, however, where Klingons do play this strope straight or near-straight:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> "Judgment" has a Klingon Lawyer represent some of the crew, and he laments how the Warrior Caste is bullying the rest of the population. He claims that this is a fairly recent trend. How recent exactly is unknown though, as his father was a teacher and his mother a biologist, and both were seemingly respected for it, but Klingons are long-lived.
</li><li> In "Blood Oath", Kor, the first-ever Klingon from TOS's "Errand of Mercy", complains about how the old ways are dying, using the aforementioned Klingon restaurant serving aliens as a specific example.
</li></ul></li><li> Alien species other than Klingons tend to play this trope straight much more often:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Ferengi</a>:
</li><li> Ferengi scientist Dr. Reyga, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "Suspicions", wished to be taken seriously by the scientific community and had to fight against his own people's mindset. He invents "Metaphasic shielding" and is then murdered. Initially, only Dr. Crusher and a small team of visiting alien scientists realize just how valuable his discovery was. Later Dr. Crusher uses the same metaphasic shields to escape and later defeat the Borg... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by hiding in the corona of a <strong>star</strong></span>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, another Ferengi, Rom, was horrible at business but a skilled engineer and handyman. Nog cites this as part of the reason he <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fuzh6RT0wx8">wants to join Starfleet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Seeing the scorn his father went through for not making a profit, despite his skill with machinery, gives Nog the inspiration to sacrifice some of his Ferengi beliefs as he strives towards, and succeeds at, becoming the first Ferengi in Starfleet. He may not make much profit for himself, but he learns to adapt his cultural upbringing (trying to get people what they want, by whatever means available) to the Federation's more open-minded ideology, becoming a talented quartermaster and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrounger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrounger">creating unofficial channels when the official ones aren't fast enough</a> to keep the ship he's serving aboard fully supplied and combat-ready. He does this so well that it suggests that had he chosen a more conventional career for a Ferengi, he would have been able to do that quite well. However, Starfleet is clearly his destiny: In one potential future, he's shown to be a respected <em>captain.</em> Nog's decision to pursue a Starfleet career also helps Rom realize his full potential; over the course of the series Rom grows a spine (he seems to be inspired by his son's example), and he eventually quits his job at the bar and becomes a station engineer, where he quickly gains respect from both the Bajorans and Starfleet for his skill. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">This eventually culminates in Rom succeeding Zek as the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance in the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>.
</li><li> Averted with Leck, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRaceGuy">Ferengi</a> "Eliminator" (read: assassin-for-hire, he "eliminates competition") who's in it for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">killing and combat</a>, not the profit. Other Ferengi are too afraid of him to show any disrespect.
</li><li> In a way, any Ferengi in military service, either in Starfleet, their own forces, or otherwise, would seem to be this. Almost by definition, money invested in a military is a profitless endeavor, a necessary sunk cost with little to no expected return. However, in the 19th century, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">British Empire</a> rose to prominence because they had the world's largest fleet ready and able to protect merchant ships and be used as a show of force for other nations to toe the line as far as trade was concerned. Commodore Perry's famous visit to Japan convinced a reclusive nation to open their markets to American trade. It would make sense for the Ferengi to have a strong military force on hand to make sure their own merchants were not harassed unduly. Plus if worse came to worst, it's helpful to remember that amateurs study tactics, while professionals study logistics, and who would know more about logistics than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRaceGuy">Ferengi?</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame">Hirogen</a>. In their culture, if you're not a hunter, you're nobody. In this case it's partially deconstructed by showing that it's directly detrimental to their society. The Hirogen used to be far more technologically advanced than they are now and are steadily devolving as a result of their nomadic, hunter-focused lifestyle.
</li><li> Zig-zags into partially reconstructed/justified when a later episode introduces a Hirogen holodeck technician, denounced by the others as "cowardly", who says he would've been a warrior had Voyager not given them holodeck technology three years ago, and strongly implies there was no such thing as a Hirogen technician before that.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">original series</a> episode "Elaan of Troyus," Elaan contemptuously dismisses engineering as a "menial" occupation, much to Scotty's irritation.
</li><li> Happens to humans too, via cultural shift. The season 1 episode "The Neutral Zone" has a group of humans who were frozen get thawed out, one of them being a financier. He has an especially hard time adjusting to his new life compared to the others, reason being that with Earth moving from a capitalistic to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScarcityEconomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScarcityEconomy">post-scarcity society</a> means that his profession is of little interest to people outside of historians. One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic">the novels</a> has him find a niche as an ambassador to the Ferengi, which is the best of both worlds: the Federation respect him as a diplomat, and the Ferengi respect him as a shrewd man of business.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> has a few examples. Peacekeepers look down on "techs" as inferior because they spend their time fixing the ships and weapons instead of fighting with them. In one episode a planet called Litagara is featured, which is run by lawyers. The 5% of the population that aren't lawyers are treated as second-class citizens.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> has a running joke about Wolowitz being the only non-Ph.D. in the group. In general, those that think (most prominently Sheldon) ridicule those that do (most prominently Wolowitz). Other characters minor and major have similar dynamics, such as Leonard's practical hypothesis testing being disdained by his own mother, a clinical neurologist which by definition requires others to test her hypotheses (and who despite focusing her work on children is an utterly incompetent parent).
</li><li> Todd the Wraith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, who is more akin to a scientist. Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">other Wraith</a>, he recognizes that foolishly gorging on human worlds means their food supply runs out faster and only leads to in-fighting between the Hives. In the last season, Todd even accepts the Atlantis team's help to find a way to rid his people of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">dependency on having to feed</a>, being one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">few Wraith to admit</a> that it is a weakness that's impeding their growth as a species. There is a <em>reason</em> why Todd is <em>over 10,000 years old</em>. That said, he is backstabbed by his own people numerous times, either directly or indirectly. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> episode, he even performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> with Ronon to blow up one of Michael's cloning factories.
</li><li> The Minbari in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> have the Religious and Warrior castes, which feature prominently in the story, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse">barely-seen and almost never-mentioned Worker caste</a> that makes the work of the other two castes possible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Worker caste does become critical when Delenn breaks the ruling Grey Council, delivering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> to <em>both</em> her own Religious caste and the Warriors...then reforming the Council with the Workers in a 5:2:2 majority to keep the other two castes in check (and ending a civil war in the process). Canon states that prior to Valen, the Grey Council didn't exist and the Workers weren't even a proper caste with any form of representation <em>at all</em>, merely slaves of the Religious and Warriors.

One instance shows up when Kim, a Unit operator's wife goes to console another military wife friend, whose air cavalry husband is recently KIA. Her friend disdainfully pushes Kim away, because her husband is now a logistics clerk, so she isn't a "soldier's wife" and has no business consoling one.
</li><li> In another episode, Unit operator Hector Williams starts dating a retired Airborne Ranger Senior NCO's daughter. Said retired NCO is contemptuous of Hector because he is just a logistics clerk. After learning Hector's true job, he starts being nice to Hector... and his daughter ends up dumping him since the entire reason she was dating a "logistics clerk" was so that she could have a husband that could easily transition to a post-military career, which a "gunman" cannot.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orks</a> have a somewhat complicated relationship with this trope:

</li><li> Amongst the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orkish</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">clans</a>, the Blood Axes are distrusted and derided due to their willingness to retreat from combat instead of dying pointlessly, hire themselves out as mercenaries to other races, adopt (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja">garish and clashing</a>) camouflage, and generally use tactics more sophisticated than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">a frontal attack</a>. In short, mainstream Orks consider them culturally contaminated by those "stinkin' 'umies!" Note that some of the most successful ork warlords <em>are</em> Blood Axes.
</li><li> A more generic Ork example are the Stormboyz, who have rebelled from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> society for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> lifestyle of military discipline, marching, and uniforms. Other Orks shake their heads at Stormboyz' obsession with battlefield intelligence beyond knowing the general direction to the enemy, but put up with their deviant behavior since Stormboyz make such effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack">jet pack</a> assault troops.
</li></ul></li><li> Psykers (people with psychic powers) are essential to the Imperium of Man, since they provide navigation to fleets through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the Warp</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">FTL communication</a>, and incredibly powerful assets on the battlefield, yet most citizens treat them with a mixture of fear and hatred, and sometimes an odd measure of respect, since a sanctioned Psyker must stand before The God-Emperor. This isn't entirely unjustified in a setting where a single Psyker's lapse of control can result in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell">Legions of Hell</a> spilling out into the material universe, and explains why <em>un</em>sanctioned Psykers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">burnt at the stake</a> with the other mutants and deviants as per government policy.
</li><li> Played with with the actual scientists in the Imperium,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ylk0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ylk0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ylk0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">as much as the term can be applied to the an institution where actual science is the outlier, in favor of twisted, unthinking, religiously dogmatic worship of rote memorization of old scientific discoveries</span> the Adeptus Mechanicus. They are absolutely necessary for keeping the Imperium technologically equipped since most scientific knowledge has been all but lost to the rest of the human race. And to the mechanicus, while many of its members are ignorant of the physics behind their technology, much of their senior staff have an understanding of technology <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">that makes their mysticism seem justified</a>. As such, the AdMech is given <em>a lot</em> of leeway, and they're pretty much a self-contained empire within an empire whose beliefs would actually be considered outright heresy by the rest of the Imperium if they didn't need them so much. Given their level of independence and lack of oversight, the Mechanicus has become a shady, secretive organization that jealously guards their monopoly on technology and often pursues their own interest at the expense of other Imperial elements. The greater part of the Imperium distrusts the Mechanicus, sometimes for good reason, and the tension has caused outbreaks of violence on occasion.
</li><li> But played straighter with the Techmarines. Since they study technology for decades on Mars in order to properly maintain the Chapter's vast amounts of technology, they are somewhat estranged from the battle-brothers who've done nothing but fight since their initiation. That said, they do get respect, since they're ten-foot tall power armored half-cyborgs with giant mechanical arms and power tools.
</li><li> Space Marine Librarians are given the respect that comes from being gifted with incredible psychic power... and the fear that comes from knowing said power can turn against you at any second through no fault of the wielder.
</li><li> Depending on the Chapter, this can be the situation for the Chapter Serfs. They are the logistical arm of the Space Marines and keep everything running since an Astartes is supposed to do nothing but fight, train to fight and maintain the weapons by which to fight. In some cases they man the Battle Barges that transport the Space Marines en masse to their staging grounds. While some Chapters treat their serfs with as much one of Humanity's Finest can afford a vanilla human, others pretty much regard their serfs as slaves.
</li><li> The Tau take pains to avert this, and their Greater Good philosophy honors all roles as equals, from the farmers and builders and scientists of the Earth Caste to the bureaucrats and merchants of the Water Caste. Of course, the ruling Ethereal Caste can be considered more equal than others.
</li><li> Cowards, warriors who didn't die during combat, and sorcerers are very much hated by Khorne, the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">War God</a> of the setting. Those pledged to him that fit in those categories (sorcerers are kidnapped instead) are denied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Warrior Heaven</a>, instead ending up chained for all eternity at the base of the Skull Throne, forging enchanted weapons and wargear for his chosen champions to use.
</li><li> The World Eaters killed all their Librarians when they fell to Chaos (Khorne specifically). That they have no psychic troops makes no difference to them as they live only to get into melee as fast as possible, to cut down the enemy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">enemy being a rather loose definition</a>) or die trying.
</li></ul></li><li> Aslan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> are a subversion. Females are expected to do all the jobs besides war and politics and esoteric specialties that can be considered related to these, for war and politics are the jobs of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller">males</a>. All the same, female Aslan get no lower status because of this arrangement.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Clans</a> get a hefty dose of this. Being that their entire society is based around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious">War Is Glorious</a> with their genetically engineered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> charging off into battles and basically ruling their society, they do not look highly upon the scientists that spliced their genes together, or the technicians that made their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">BattleMech</a>'s weapons twice as effective as those used by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">Inner Sphere</a>, or the merchants who arranged for the budget needed to support its construction, or the labourers who actually did all the hard work. Clan Warriors scorn scientists, the mechanics that repair their equipment, the merchants who plan their economy, and laborers. This even shows up in their faster-than-light capable JumpShips and WarShips, where technicians seem to be regarded as expendable - a captured Clan technician on an Inner Sphere warship is surprised at all the protective gear and life support equipment that engineers are given when working in dangerous conditions.
<ul><li> The Clan that took this the furthest was the now dead Smoke Jaguars. They decided that worrying about such things as logistics and manufacturing were beneath the dignity of a warrior and took to raiding their neighbors for needed materials rather than bothering to build their own. This came back to seriously bite them in the ass after they invaded the Inner Sphere, because they took so many casualties that their anemic level of production couldn't come close to producing enough mechs to bring their forces back up to strength, and when the Inner Sphere governments teamed up to attack them several years later (the Inner Sphere wanted to send a message to the Clans and tried to destroy what they thought was the strongest Clan in the Inner Sphere at the time) everyone realized that the Jaguars were really a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperTiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperTiger">Paper Tiger</a> and they were completely wiped out.
</li><li> This supercilious glorification of the Warrior Caste at the expense of all the others <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">comes back later in the official history to bite the Clans in their collective ass.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> True to this trope, it's the Scientists who feel the most unappreciated, and a large, secret cabal of them end up leading a bloody revolt among many of the major Clans of note, costing untold lives and materiel and effectively destroying the Clans' aforementioned technology studies that made them military powerhouses.</span> The lesson to be learned in all of this is that you must give your non-warrior castes the same brooding level of respect as your warrior peers lest you lead yourself destroying your own society faster than normal due to internal strife and your opponents will view you as a laughably inept faction who can't seem to answer its own basic needs of common necessities.
</li><li> Unsurprisingly, the most successful Clans are the ones who avert this trope, namely Clan Diamond Shark, Clan Star Adder, Clan Coyote and Clan Ghost Bear. To a much lesser extent, Clan Wolf before the Refusal War may count as another Clan to avert this trope due to their Warden philosophy and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> Khan Ulric Kerensky who knew how things actually worked in the realm of politics. The Ghost Bears have a concept of "family" that, though not quite as closely interwoven as Inner Sphere Society's concept, makes fellow clansmen much more closely-knit than other clans. The Bears' scientist caste was notably the least penetrated by the aforementioned <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">disaffected scientist cabal.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">Not-Named-Clan</a> was the one clan to completely avert this trope by allowing free flow of personell between castes and more-or-less discarding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Fantastic Caste System</a> of the Clans altogether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">in order to increase efficiency</a>. The result of these policies was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">for the founder of the Clans to make an example of those who diverged from his vision</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">and having them all wiped out</a>.

<ul><li> The Vanguard are a society of mages who secretly protect the Coalition States, a society who considers mages the enemy and generally tortures then executes them. The Vanguard pretty much accept this paranoia and protect the CS in spite of it, much along the lines of Merlin in the BBC TV series.
</li><li> Psi-Stalkers and Dog Boys (mutant humans and bio-engineered humanoid dogs) are the most reliable magic (and supernatural) detectors for keeping squishy human territory free of mega-threats, yet they are discriminated against as second-class citizens (as are all psychics) and viewed with great fear and paranoia. This has begun to change since the Coalition War Campaign, as Dog Boys have become trusted allies of humanity and psychics have been accepted into the military.
</li><li> In the <em>Skraypers</em> setting, the Tarlok have a certain disdain for the Shertar caste. Many of them don't join the military, instead focusing on weapons development and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes">Playing with Syringes</a> (another form of weapons development).

Werewolves are stratified into their societal roles of lorekeepers, judges, mystics, and the like through their Auspice (the moon phase they're born under, or adopt with the right rite), which also governs how they gain rank and renown in society (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">Ragabash</a>, who are allowed to be more freeform). That said, there's also no social stigma attached to a werewolf filling a nontraditional role, like a Theurge who's also a great warrior or a Philodox with an active sense of satire...so long as they can, at minimum, fulfill their Auspice duties ("Sure, that Ahroun warrior can recite whole sagas, but can he <em>fight</em>?").

<ul><li> An unefficial 3rd Edition splatbook discussed the concept in regard to the dwarves. Normally, practitioners of arcane magic (i.e. wizards, sorcerers and the like) are shunned because they go against the grain among Dwarven society. The closest they come to accepting the idea is the "Raver", a dwarf wizard who was driven insane when his latent magical talent manifested, and is essentially treated as a mentally ill family member. However, if a Raver wanders off and leaves the burrow, nobody's exactly hurrying to bring them back (though they do feel guilty about feeling this way).
</li><li> In the game's actual canon, things are a bit better, as dwarves may not particularly like spellcasters but they do like magic items and they also like someone who can use magic to protect their warriors, provide early warning from attack, quickly move earth and stone to set up bulwarks, or conjure up powerful elementals to smash their enemies into bits.

Dealing with money was considered beneath samurai, so obviously the couldn't touch the stuff. But money dealings were necessary. So peasants were selected to handle the merchanting, but then disparaged because they were so much less useful than Samurai (who protect and serve) and the peasants who actually produce value (like farmers and craftsmen). So, you have a class of people who, by their very nature, develop power, but who are abused and downtrodden at every turn by the holders of higher social power for no rational reason... yeah, a conspiracy to overthrow the nobility was inevitable. And UNDERSTANDABLE. Were we supposed to clap when they lost? Oh, right, they did evil stuff like mind control. Good thing the legitimate Samurai government never did evil stuff.

<ul><li> Krogan scientists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> are so rare that the other races don't even think they're <em>smart enough</em> to have them. In the first game, Urdnot Wrex (himself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Warrior Poet</a> who feels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">My Species Doth Protest Too Much</a>) sarcastically asks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> when was the last time they saw a krogan scientist. Further, the straightest example of this trope actually comes from salarian scientist Mordin Solus, who was recruited into the party for his own scientific expertise. During one conversation about the genophage, if Shepard asks him whether krogan adaptation to it could be because of krogan scientists making a breakthrough, he disdainfully replies that he's never met a krogan scientist worthy of the title.
<ul><li> There's a downplayed subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>: Saren has a krogan scientist in his employ that tragically gets no lines other than pleading with you not to destroy his work—while attacking you.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">the second game</a>, we actually meet <em>three</em> scientifically inclined krogan. The most prominent was Warlord Okeer, an old general who was also a successful biologist or geneticist, whom pretty much every other krogan speaks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">with revulsion and disdain</a>. It's hinted that he may have been a war criminal of a sort that other krogan couldn't stomach, but most of the hate is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaleOfScientificSins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaleOfScientificSins">due to nature of his experiments</a> (but nevertheless succeeded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">creating</a> the most badass krogan since Wrex himself). Then came Urdnot Fortack, who was assigned duties such as medicinal engineering and crop genetics; a duty Fortack laments, saying that krogan scientists are supposed to make things that explode. And finally, the krogan mechanic on Tuchanka, who complains that he never gets any respect for what he does, even though everything would fall apart if he wasn't there to fix it. Krogan mechanics working on other worlds do seem to get respect though.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lord High Researcher Fortack:</strong> My predecessor said no one would understand the true worth of my work. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">As I pulled my blade from his chest</a>, I knew he was telling the truth. <br/><strong>Commander Shepard:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Not exactly what I would call effective academic peer review</a>.
</div></li><li> The krogan do at least try to subvert this trope, and the few scientists that do exist aren't exactly out of shape nerds, either. Lord High Researcher Fortack mentions how he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">killed his predecessor to get his position</a> as Clan Urdnot's scientist. And Okeer, after all, <em>was</em> a Warlord. Krogan Shamans undergo horrific rites to gain their position, rites that kill many krogans, and so are worthy of respect. Krogan Ambassadors represent the strength of their clan and so must themselves be mighty warriors lest their clan be viewed as weak. Further, krogan recognize that not everyone can be a great warrior, so their combat rituals allow an individual to bring a squad of friends (called a "krantt"). As the krogan running Grunt's puberty rite puts it:
<div class="indent"><strong>Urdnot Shaman:</strong> Not every krogan can be the strongest warrior, but each must inspire loyalty and the will to fight in his comrades.
</div></li><li> This also explains why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">even the nicest Paragon Shepard</a> easily earns the krogans' respect; if Wrex of all people was willing to follow them and defer to their command, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">they must be doing something right.</a> Bonus points if Shepard is an Engineer, on top of all that.
</li><li> On Tuchanka, you can overhear a pair of Urdnot warriors discussing how one of them actually wishes to become a scientist, to the relative bemusement of his comrade. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end of the conversation chain, the aspirant wins a full-ride scholarship to attend a prestigious university on the Citadel, and can barely contain his excitement.</span>

As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> traits who openly seek to enter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Sovngarde</a> when they die, the Nords openly deride those who practice magic as weaklings. They do make an exception for the Restoration school of magic, as they do appreciate good healers. They also enjoy having their weapons and armor enchanted — a hypocrisy which irritates the College of Winterhold's resident enchanter, who notes that at least his profession "will always be accepted, if not liked." In <em>Skyrim</em>, one can meet the old Nordic god Tsun, who states that this was not always the case — the ancient Nords referred to magic as "the Clever Craft," and suitably heroic mages were considered to have earned their place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Sovngarde</a>, spells or no spells. (Many of these heroes were still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knights</a> though, and quite capable in melee combat if the situation calls for it.) These anti-magic beliefs only became worse during the Oblivion Crisis, since the Nord population at large blamed mages for the crisis in the first place.
</li><li> The Redguards are another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">race of Men</a> which has an open dislike for those who practice magic. In their case, the only exception is made for users of the Destruction school, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill">as dealing more damage is always a good thing</a> in their culture. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>, Trayvond, a student at the Mages' Guild hall in Cheydinhal, lampshades this:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Trayvond:</strong> I'm Trayvond the Redguard, Mages' Guild Evoker. Surprised? Yes, you don't see many Redguards in the Mages' Guild. We don't much like spellcasters in Hammerfell. Wizards steal souls and tamper with minds. If you use magic, you're weak or wicked.
</div><ul><li> The Orcs also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">pride themselves on martial pursuits</a>, as well as smithing and hunting. Their culture also respects practical sorcery and medicinal herbology, to an extent, as skills for survival. But they have no love for superficial, aesthetic or luxurious things, which means Orc artists, merchants and scholars tend to be scorned by their kin and doubted by those of other races. Perhaps best exemplified by Duma gro-Lag, an Orc sculptor in * <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> who laments that his friends only appreciate his sculptures as things they can smash for fun.
</li></ul></li><li> The general populace in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> games fear mages. But magic is extremely useful, and mages were vital in halting the Qunari's previous crusade. So much so that even the magic-hating Qunari have started putting their own mages to good use.
<ul><li> Averted if the Warden is a Mage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>. During the ending, First Enchanter Irving admits that he honestly never thought he'd live to see the day when the people of Ferelden would fill the streets, gladly cheering for a <em>Mage</em> who has become their saviour.
</li><li> Similarly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, where a Mage Hawke is adored by the population of Kirkwall for single-handedly ending the Qunari invasion, despite having been outed as an illegal Apostate who'd been secretly operating under the Templars noses for several years. This effectively makes Mage!Hawke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentAdorationRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentAdorationRating">politically untouchable</a> by the Templars in Kirkwall.
</li><li> Anders is similarly beloved by the Ferelden refugees in Kirkwall, due to working tirelessly as their Healer in his clinic in Darktown. This is despite his activities in the Mage Underground and his occasional lapses into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk">Dr. Jerk</a> territory at times.
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much any noncombatant is widely disdained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">the Aurorans</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity">EV Nova</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Ironically</a>, the Auroran house that most fulfills the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> trope, House Heraan, is also the house that is most likely to avert this trope. That's why they get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">cool starships</a> like the Argosy and Thunderforge: they actually pay for scientific research. With this said, while <em>scientists</em> are consistently looked down upon by the other Houses, the degree to which other non-warrior professions are looked down upon varies. For instance, the description for the House Dani world of Palein notes that engineers and physicians are given at least grudging respect (as the warriors are very well aware of how much they need both to <em>keep</em> fighting), with it going so far as to say that no-one would <em>dare</em> insult the graduate physicians of Palein, who spend their lives healing the countless warriors seriously injured in battle.
</li><li> Averted by the Iron and Ash Legions of the Charr in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>. While even their leaderships seems dead set on domination and bloodlust, they're second only to Asuran <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> in terms of technological and industrial development and have created technology ranging from tanks to the printing press. They don't consider their scholars or technicians any less of a combatant than their front-line soldiers, though.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">The three Legions give each other flak</a> for their main methods of warfare. The dedicated infantry of the Blood Legion often deride the Iron and Ash for relying on crutches (technology and stealth/deception respectively) and only change their mind about individuals from those Legions who prove themselves in combat.

</li><li> Also invoked by the bloodelf city guards of Silvermoon. When asked for the location of certain profession trainers they sometimes mention something about getting one's hands dirty, like herbalism means "digging in dirt". It should be mentioned that the bloodelf society is a very decadent one, most labor is done by magic, just wandering through Silvermoon shows enchanted brooms sweeping the streets, signposts inscribing themselves, etc.

</li><li> In game, the chief engineer of the <em>Bortasqu</em>', Tarol, gripes that engineers and the like do all the hard work and the warriors get the credit. This is exemplified in "House Pegh" when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">B'Eler, a member of said house, is able to figure out a way to turn Omega molecules against the Iconian T'Ket, allowing Kahless to wound it.

After the people had met with other enlightened races like the Chozo and the Luminoth, the civilization ushered in an age of science that advanced the people while those that did not support science met the event with disdain and wanted to retain their traditional primal ways. The people that were for science looked down upon those adhering to tradition and saw them as lesser beings that were clinging onto outdated ways of living while the traditionalists saw scientists as traitors of their culture. A terrible civil war broke out between the two groups when the first lord of science banished all the primals from the city and all of the scientists were eventually killed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">A leviathan seed then crashed into the planet</a> and spread its phazon, corrupting whatever what left of the civilization by reducing them to mindless savages.

After Garkul died, though the Kruk were treated like crap by other orcs who couldn't understand why the Kruk were wasting their time building things instead of killing humans like real orcs.
