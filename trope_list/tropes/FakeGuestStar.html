<p>An actor who is, to all outward observation, a member of the regular cast, but who still receives guest billing. This usually has something to do with their contract and whether or not it stipulates that they receive main cast billing (and possibly with how much they get paid), though in some cases, it may be done as a gimmick to call attention to an actor whose reputation vastly exceeds that of the rest of the cast. This can also happen if a guest star becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> and is written into future episodes to capitalize on their unexpected popularity, which may eventually lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promotion to Opening Titles</a>. Other times, however, they remain guest stars due to difficulties modifying the opening titles. Often with many cases exclusivity can have an effect. If a cast member is a regular, then that show has them somewhat "locked down," and they have to stay at the cost of other projects. However, if they're merely a "guest star," that can often give them the freedom to work on other projects if they want to.

Nearly 2 seasons in and Thomas has appeared in every episode of the series except one. Keidrich Sellati and Holly Taylor, who play the Jennings children, have appeared in fewer episodes, despite being main cast members.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza">Bonanza</a></em>: Done once, in 1972's "The Lonely Man" for regular cast member Victor Seng Yung, who played Hop Sing, who was a regular and appeared in 80 percent of the episodes. This was the only episode where Hop Sing — who falls in love with a white woman (in an episode about unjust interracial marriage laws) — is the primary character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueBloods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueBloods">Blue Bloods</a></em> does this to a good part of the cast (Jack &amp; Sean, Garrett, Baker, Jackie, Eddie, Baez, and Sid). To be fair, the opening sequence is about 20-30 seconds long.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Little House on the Prairie</a></em>: This was done occasionally with regular cast members (outside of those playing the original Ingalls family) credited as guest stars for episodes in which they were the main focus. Some examples: Season 6's "Second Spring" (with Richard Bull and Katherine MacGregor promoted to "Special Guest Star" status) and Season 8's "A Promise to Keep" (Victor French, who had just rejoined the cast).

The repertory cast, for years, was considered the "main" cast, and all the other players were there to supplement the main cast. Starting at about season 16, the line between featured player and repertory player began to blur, to the point that by season 38, the only real difference between a "featured" player and the main cast is how they're billed. New players always spend at least one season (usually two) being billed as "featuring" and then get moved up. This is a change from seasons 1—23 wherein new players intended to be used regularly would always be moved straight to the main cast. Ana Gasteyer and Tracy Morgan were the last players this happened to; everyone hired since has spent at least a season as a featured player (with the exception of Amy Poehler, who was introduced as a featured player, but was promoted to the repertory cast later in her first season).
<ul><li> In season 42, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlecBaldwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlecBaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> appeared in more than half the episodes as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, so in the eyes of the Emmy Awards he was considered a cast member and was nominated in the comedy Supporting Actor category (which he won).
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jim Rash is listed as a guest star in the first two seasons although he appears in almost every episode and often drives the plot. (He had the first lines of dialogue in the Pilot) He eventually made it to the titles in season 3.
</li><li> Jonathan Banks is only listed as a guest star in season 5 although he appears in every episode except for the season premiere, which is focused on rebooting the series with (most of) the original cast.
</li><li> Paget Brewster and Keith David are only credited as guest stars in season 6, though they appear in most of the episodes (in Brewster's case, all 13 episodes of the season; David appeared in all but the premiere).
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>, Andy Hallett, the actor who played Lorne, was listed as a guest star or special guest star until the late 4th season, despite appearing in all but a handful of episodes since his debut in Season 2, Episode 1.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">Both</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">incarnations</a> of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> have a veritable parade of "guest stars" who've appeared in almost every episode.
<ul><li> The new series upped the ante by listing some actors <em>before</em> guest stars but without a "Guest Starring" credit, leaving them in some strange netherworld between "guest star" and "regular". Actors listed this way included Helo, Cally, Dee, Gaeta, Billy, Sam, Tyrol, Crashdown and Tigh — who may just be the Most Triumphant Example of this trope, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelHogan">Michael Hogan</a> appears in more episodes than most of the actors who are <em>actually in the opening credits</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> An odd example with Danielle Fishel as Topanga on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em>. She doesn't appear till the 4th episode and appears in very few for the next handful of episodes. By mid season onward she gets a significant amount of screen time equal or more than Lee Noris as Minkus who receives top billing while Fishel is relegated to guest star. Ironically she finally received top billing in season 2, but has significantly less screen time, with only a few early episode feature her getting any significant focus after that she has very little to do with any of the story-lines. By season 3 she becomes Cory's girlfriend and settles into being part of the main cast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonMomoa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonMomoa">Jason Momoa</a>, who played the not-at-all insubstantial role of Khal Drogo, was never credited in the opening titles of the first season, despite his character out-living several of the top-billed characters. Instead his name appears at the end of guest star credits in the ending credits of each episode with an "Also Starring" attached to it. This was purportedly because Momoa wanted an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring">And Starring</a>" credit, which would put him on equal billing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDinklage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDinklage">Peter Dinklage</a> — despite the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Khal Drogo dies in Season 1</span> while Tyrion Lannister has gone on to be the protagonist (insofar as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast">Ensemble Cast</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting">Four Lines, All Waiting</a> <em>has</em> one) and receive first billing in place of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Decoy Protagonist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanBean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanBean">Sean Bean</a>.

</li><li> Neither <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulianGlover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulianGlover">Julian Glover</a> (Pycelle) nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConlethHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConlethHill">Conleth Hill</a> (Varys) are credited as regulars in the first season, even though they are arguably as important and appear as often as <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AidenGillen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AidenGillen">Aiden Gillen</a> (Littlefinger), who is credited as a regular.

</li><li> Roose Bolton's actor is only billed as a guest star from Seasons 2-4 despite Roose being one of Robb's top lieutenants and eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a>. He eventually gets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promotion to Opening Titles</a> starting Season 5,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which doesn't last long because he dies early in Season 6.</span>

In fact, the only name in the opening titles was Peter Horton.

<ul><li> The show had quite a few, including Anthony Stewart Head after he rejoined the cast for the final season, Amber Benson in all but her final appearance (despite appearing in almost 50 episodes) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizaDushku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizaDushku">Eliza Dushku</a>, who appeared in a key role in over half the third season episodes yet never got billing beyond "guest star". Anthony Steward Head was billed as a Super-Duper Extra Special Guest Star though.

</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> The third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bugs">Bugs</a></em> used the same opening titles as the second, meaning only Craig McLachlan, Jaye Griffiths and Jesse Birdsall were credited. Jan Harvey was given a special credit at the start of each episode (and, strangely, Leslie Ash was accorded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillingDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillingDisplacement">the same honour</a> for the first two episodes as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra">appearing in the season's publicity photos</a>), but Paula Hunt as new team member Alex was simply listed on the closing credits, despite appearing in every episode.

</li><li> The only actors on the opening titles of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrimeTraveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrimeTraveller">Crime Traveller</a></em> were Michael French and Chloe Annette, with Sue Johnson getting an extra credit post-titles. Despite this, Paul Trussell and Richard Dempsey as the other members of CID appear in every episode and Bob Goody as caretaker Danny only missed one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickVanDykeShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickVanDykeShow">The Dick Van Dyke Show</a></em> has a couple, most notably Richard Deacon as Mel Cooley, who has appeared in more than half of all episodes on the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Drive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Drive">Drive</a></em> listed Dylan Baker as a guest star for five of its six episodes. He was finally moved to the opening credits for the finale. Oddly, Rochelle Aytes, Riley Smith, and Mircea Monroe were not in all six episodes, but were listed in the opening credits.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimCurry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimCurry">Tim Curry</a> as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the main antagonist</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Earth2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Earth2">Earth 2</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrowedItDownToTheGuyIRecognize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrowedItDownToTheGuyIRecognize">given away</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">by his performance</a> and billing, despite being in more episodes than some of the regulars (also not helped when the show was cancelled).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em> is a frequent offender. Many regular nurses and receptionists who appear in every episode receive guest star billing.
<ul><li> Of particular note are Laura Ceron (Chuny) and Deezer D (Malik), who each have been in more episodes than everyone except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoahWyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoahWyle">Noah Wyle</a> and Laura Innes, but all their appearances were under normal guest star billing.
</li></ul></li><li> Frank Dekova appeared in every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FTroop">F Troop</a></em> save one from the show's first season as Chief Wild Eagle, the grumpy and grizzled but goodnatured leader of the pacifistic Hekawis tribe. The producers felt he was such an important part of the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">that he was added to the credits for the second season.</a>
</li><li> Jool, Noranti, and Sikozu on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>. Actresses Melissa Jaffer and Raelee Hill, who played Noranti and Sikozu respectively, were credited as guest stars even in the small handful of Season 4 episodes they didn't appear in.
<ul><li> Not to mention Jonathan Hardy, though this is somewhat justified in that he was only a voice actor. Still, he appeared in every single episode of the show.
</li><li> An interesting version is Lani Tupu. He was credited in the main cast in Season 3, where he was a regular cast member, but (if memory serves) never as a guest star, even in episodes he guest starred in as Captain Bailar Crais. The kicker? He's in nearly every episode (if not every episode) as the voice of Pilot. The latter role is credited in the ending credits.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashGordon2007" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashGordon2007">Flash Gordon (2007)</a></em> listed Jonathan Lloyd Walker, who played Rankol, as a guest star, even though he was in every episode (albeit only via stock footage in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a>), meaning he appeared more than Jody Racicot (Zarkov) and John Ralston (Ming) who were on the opening titles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>: Dan Butler played Bulldog, and appeared in nearly every episode for the first few years as a guest. During the latter years, he was moved to the opening cast credits — but appeared in very few actual episodes because Butler was touring with his one man show <em>The Worst Thing You Could Have Ever Told Me</em>.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusyPhillips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusyPhillips">Busy Phillips</a>' character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></em> remains a guest star throughout the series' run, but she gets just as much screen time and dialogue as any of the stars. One of the DVD commentaries states that Kim Kelly was intended to be a minor character, but the creators ended up liking her too much to not keep her around.
</li><li> Edward Herrmann is listed as "Special appearance by" in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleSequence">Title Sequence</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em> despite being in nearly every episode.
</li><li> Aaron Hill as "Beaver" and Derek Mio as "Wade" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greek">Greek</a></em>. As Kappa Tau's right and left hand men, both were relegated to "Also Starring" in the end credits until Chapter 3, when they were Promoted To...the guest star list.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heartbeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heartbeat">Heartbeat</a></em> ended up with an extensive ensemble cast and sometimes had as many as 13 actors on the opening titles...but Claire Calbraith, who was on the show for two years as Tricia Summerbee and was effectively the female lead on Season 11 and the first half of Season 12 was never given the honour. (Curiously, soon after she left, several more minor characters were added on, as if they'd been waiting for her to go before putting them on.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> has several, but the only recurring characters to be promoted are HRG in season 1, Sylar and Ando in season 2, Angela in season 3, and Samuel in season 4. Important characters who were <em>not</em> promoted include Sandra, the Haitian, West, Daphne, Knox, and many more. Indeed, season 3 <em>demoted</em> several characters - and one of them, Elle, has grown to being a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeGuestStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeGuestStar">fake special guest star</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway">Home and Away</a></em> has many examples from recent years. Most notable are Sam Holden, Melody Jones, and Angelo Rosetta who appear just as much as the regulars and have several major storylines.
<ul><li> This appears to be the exception, as although they're involved in major storylines, none of them have had anywhere near as much screen time as the regulars.
</li><li> Morag Bellingham's actress had a special contract allowing her to come and go from the show as she pleased, which is why she was never credited as a main star.
</li><li> Angelo's now a regular.
</li><li> Given regular characters only appear in two or three episodes out of five in each week anyway, most of these do actually appear as much as the regulars. Melody was set up as a new foster child and considered a regular by many, so her sudden decision to go back to her evil mother who apparently wasn't evil anymore, just a few weeks into a new season and having just had two episodes to herself, was a bit of a shock.
</li><li> However, characters like Sam and Angelo did have a story arc to follow which ended in them leaving the bay (in a body bag and police car, respectively). They weren't intended to stay for very long.
</li><li> Angelo returned just three months after his apparent exit, was rapidly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles">Promoted to Opening Titles</a> and stuck around for another two years.
</li><li> Stacey Macklin was a curious case in the early years, she appeared as much as anyone and outlasted several regulars yet was always credited as a guest star.
</li></ul></li><li> Pushed to an extreme in the latter half of the fourth season, and the entire fifth season, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>, where House's new team of doctors, whom he spends most of his time <strike>ordering around</strike> interacting with, are guest stars, whereas two members of his former team, played by Jennifer Morrison and Jesse Spencer, have been relegated to occasional roles but are still billed as regulars. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in the first half of the fourth season in that there were far more potential members of the new team than would actually end up on it and revealing which ones were to become regulars would spoil it.
</li><li> The TV miniseries/DTV movie series <em>Josh Kirby...Time Warrior!</em> effectively had two sets of opening credits (one which played as a typical TV series intro, another that was simply the rest of the cast and crew for the movies on a black background, like a regular movie). The TV Show credits played up the roles of Corbin Allred (Josh Kirby), Derek Webster (Dr Zoetrope) and Jennifer Burns (Azabeth Siege), yet Barrie Ingham (Irwin 1138) is relegated to the rest of the cast, spoiling a major plot point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified">Justified</a></em>: Walt Goggins appeared as Boyd in 9 episodes of the first season's 13, but wasn't promoted to part of the regular cast until season 2.
<ul><li> This example is somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">*ahem*</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> one since initially Boyd Crowder was supposed to die in the pilot, just as he does in the short story the series is based on, but was so popular in test screenings that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">Spared by the Adaptation</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Dame Thora Hird, Jean Alexander and Dora Bryan made a "Special Guest Appearance" virtually every episode for years on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine">Last of the Summer Wine</a></em>. They finally started being listed as members of the regular cast in 2002.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>: Tamara Tunie, who played Medical Examiner Melinda Warner in nearly every episode of seasons 4—6, was always credited as a guest star because of a conflict with her contract for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns">As the World Turns</a></em> which wouldn't allow her to take top billing on any other show. That contract ended in 2007, however, and she was immediately promoted to SVU's opening credits.
</li><li> Leslie Hendrix as Medical Examiner Elizabeth Rodgers on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em>. She's been on the original series longer than any of the current cast members.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, some recurring characters have appeared more than some members of the main cast, and yet are relegated to guest status. Examples include Tom in season three, who only appeared in one less episode than cast member Claire, and Frank in season four, who has appeared more times than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Michael</span> and Desmond, and just as many times as Miles. As of the season 5 finale, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Richard Alpert</a> has appeared more than any other guest star, to the point where some confuse him as being a member of the main cast. This may stem from rumors that Richard would join the main cast in season 4, which then repeated themselves prior to season 5, but Richard is still a guest star. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promoted To Opening Credits</a> in season 6).
<ul><li> Nikki and Paulo in season 3 and Daniel, Miles, and Charlotte in season 4 are all credited as guest stars in press releases but as main cast members in the episodes themselves. While this discrepancy was fixed for Daniel and Miles in season 5, the issue persisted with Charlotte...though it didn't matter for long because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she dies five episodes into season 5</span>.
</li><li> Almost every recurring character got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promotion to Opening Titles</a> in the series finale.
</li></ul></li><li> Jonathan Harris (Dr. Smith) was billed as a "Special Guest Star" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace">Lost in Space</a></em>, despite being a regular member of the cast. This is because he was not added to the show until after the original pilot was produced, and none of the other cast members were willing to renegotiate their contracts for lower billing. To compensate for sticking Harris at the end, the "Special Guest Star" credit was invented to give him featured billing. This was the beginning of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring">And Starring</a> custom in credits to put featured players at the end of the list with a special notation.
<ul><li> According to a documentary on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace">Lost in Space</a></em> 3rd season DVD boxset, Jonathan Harris also got paid more for his "Special Guest Star" status. The studio apparently tried to get him moved into the credits with the others starting at the beginning of season 2, but he refused.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSlattery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSlattery">John Slattery</a> was credited as a guest star in spite of Roger Sterling's major part in the first season and seasons that would follow. He appears in 10 of the 13 episodes of season 1. Notably, Maggie Siff (Rachel Menken) is a main cast member in season 1 but only appears in 7 episodes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClorisLeachman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClorisLeachman">Cloris Leachman</a> was always billed as a special guest star during her time on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></em>, probably due to her Oscar win before the show aired.
</li><li> Heather Locklear was billed as "Special Guest Star" for her entire run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelrosePlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelrosePlace">Melrose Place</a>,</em> despite being the main character for the last several seasons and appearing in all but the first 20 episodes of the show.
<ul><li> Additionally, Laura Leighton appears in all but two episodes in the second season, though isn't promoted until season three. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarciaCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarciaCross">Marcia Cross</a> appears in every episode (barring one) in season three, though is only upgraded to series regular status in season four. Plus, Patrick Muldoon and Rena Sofer play major roles in the show's fourth and seventh seasons respectively and appear in almost every episode, yet are never given anything above "guest star" billing.
</li></ul></li><li> Martin Landau appeared in all but two episodes of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em>, with his character Rollin Hand being an important part of the IMF team and having a major role in nearly every mission... and each time he was credited as a "Guest Star" or "Special Appearance". The story goes that Landau was wary about committing himself to the series out of fear that he would be unable to appear in other projects at the same time and thus he didn't want to be bound to contract, so he didn't officially join the cast until the second season.
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></em> only listed Angela Lansbury as a star, an true to that, she's the only person to star in even 20% of the series' episodes. Frequently recurring actors like William Windom, Ron Masak, and Tom Bosley (who each took on major roles when featured) were only billed as part of the ensemble "also starring" roll at each episode's opening. As they were listed in alphabetical order, Windom was often billed last among the episode's actors as a result.
</li><li> The series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MutantX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MutantX">Mutant X</a></em> had Tom McCamus as the villainous Mason Eckhart. Despite appearing in every single episode (not to mention the show's title sequence montage) of the first season, he was billed as a guest star.
</li><li> Sean Murray appeared in roughly a third of the episodes in season one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>, and was billed as a guest star. He was promoted to the main cast in season two and has remained there ever since.

He was credited as a Special Guest Star starting from Season 6 and appeared on the DVD boxset covers (the only person to do so and not be a main cast member at the time) from Season 7. Heck, he's even had whole episodes about him! Which made it all the more heartwarming when he was <em>finally</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles">Promoted to Opening Titles</a> for the show's tenth season.

Why this was the case for Katya is anyone's guess but the actors playing Will and Lolly left very soon after joining the show, which is probably why they were never promoted.
<ul><li> Though all three were included in the opening credits, however briefly.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em>, Ryan Robbins was listed as a guest star for all of season one, despite appearing in thirteen out of fourteen episodes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>, at least four guest stars have appeared in over 50 episodes-Christa Miller played Jordan in 79, Sam Llyod played Ted in 83, Aloma Wright was Laverne or Shirley in 90, and Robert Maschio played Todd in 105.

</li><li> Tim Conway appeared on every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCarolBurnettShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCarolBurnettShow">The Carol Burnett Show</a></em> for several seasons as a "guest star," before becoming an official regular.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors">The Tudors</a></em>, there's Anthony Brophy. He played Eustace Chapuys, and is in more episodes than anyone except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanRhysMeyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanRhysMeyers">Jonathan Rhys Meyers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryCavill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryCavill">Henry Cavill</a> - who are the only actors who appear in every episode. Joely Richardson (Katherine Parr) probably qualifies as well - she's in the main credits but billed as a "Special Guest Star".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> in its nine years never <em>added</em> actors to the main billing whose characters were newly introduced. The only character who was dropped from actor billing was Crystal after she never appeared anymore, but numerous other characters were introduced that became indispensable to the show's plot, particularly Bev, David, Jerry, Leon, Mark, Nancy and Scott. But none of their actors ever got more than a guest credit, as the main billing became strictly limited to the fictional immediate family (minus Jerry who was born later) and Jackie.
</li><li> Similar to <em>Roseanne,</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em> never added actors to its main billing. Val, Yetta, and especially Sylvia became much more prominent as the series wore on, yet Rachel Chagall, Ann Guilbert, and Renee Taylor were always guest stars.
</li><li> The U.S. version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS">Shameless</a></em> has Joan Cusack playing Shelia, who continues to be credited as a guest star despite her major role in all 4 seasons. This has helped her secure Emmy nods for Outstanding Guest Actress every year.
</li><li> Matthew Timmons, who plays Woody on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOnDeck">The Suite Life on Deck</a></em>, never received anything other than guest star billing.
<ul><li> Which is actually quite odd since when Doc Shaw showed up in the Second Season, he automatically got Star Billing even though they play comparable roles.
</li><li> The same is true for Adrian R'Mante who played Esteban in the parent series appearing in most episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> is a regular offender of this. Carlos Bernard (Tony Almeida) spent the whole <em>first season</em> as a guest star, despite getting ample screen time in nearly every episode. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brien) spent <em>two whole seasons</em> as a guest star before finally being added to the main cast, again despite appearing in nearly every episode of both seasons. This is especially odd as Sarah Wynter (Kate Warner), James Badge Dale (Chase Edmunds), and Leslie Hope (Teri Bauer) all appeared in only one season each, yet received regular cast billing for their respective seasons.
<ul><li> Roger Cross (Curtis Manning) spent the greater part of season four as a guest star before finally being bumped up to regular cast billing for the last third of it, and has remained at that position for the rest of his stay on the show.
</li><li> Oddly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LanaParrilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LanaParrilla">Lana Parrilla</a> (Sarah Gavin) was also moved up to main cast mid-season in season 4 despite only appearing in half of the season and never appearing in any other season. On the other hand, Jude Ciccolella (Mike Novick) appeared in more episodes than all but seven other actors and never got billing above guest star—though he did get the "special appearance" billing reserved for returning cast members in the first episode of Season 5 along with Reiko Aylesworth (Michelle Dessler) and Dennis Haysbert (David Palmer), both of whom <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">were killed off in that episode</span>.
<ul><li> The opening credits of the season 5 premiere are somewhat of an indirect spoiler, as while Aylesworth is listed as a guest star, Carlos Bernard is listed with the main cast.
</li><li> It's also a little ironic since Bernard was actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra">Advertised Extra</a> in season five.
</li></ul></li><li> Reiko Aylesworth, D.B. Woodside (Wayne Palmer), and Louis Lombardi (Edgar Stiles) all notably appeared in all 24 episodes of a season (notably remaining vital to that year's events the entire time) before being upgradged to main cast the following one. In Woodside's case, he actually appeared in a little bit of the fifth season as well (he wasn't in the fourth) before finally joining the cast in season six. Similarly, like Carlos Bernard, Penny Johnson Jerald (Sherry Palmer) was in nearly every episode of the first season and didn't join the main cast until the second.
</li><li> Jude Ciccoella (Mike Novick) is also a notable case, as he was heavily involved in the first, second, fourth and especially fifth seasons, even going so far as getting a promotional photograph for the latter, but was never credited as a main cast member. Similar cases where an actor or actress was never officially part of the main cast but had a large enough role they might as well have been include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacharyQuinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacharyQuinto">Zachary Quinto</a> (Adam Kaufman) in season 3 and Necar Zadeganj and Nazneen Contractor (Dalia and Kayla Hassan, respectively) in season 8

Most appear in over <em>25</em> episodes of their respective seasons, though still credited under "guest star" billing (though Kathleen Robertson was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles">Promoted to Opening Titles</a> come season 6). Also, when Luke Perry returned, he was credited as a "special guest star" though he appeared in every episode from his return until the end.
</li><li> Bonita Friedericy remained a "guest star" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em> for three seasons, despite being in almost every episode. She was upgraded to the main cast for Season 4. In an earlier example, Season 1 had Ryan McPartlin and the actors for the Buy More staff, who appeared in most of the episodes (or in the case of both Scott Krinsky and Vik Sahay, <em>every</em> episode) but would have to wait until Season 2 before they were credited in the main cast.
</li><li> Amy Acker appeared in all but three episodes of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>, playing the important, highly recurring role of Dr. Claire Saunders. Despite occasionally appearing in more scenes than some of the regular cast, Acker was still considered a guest star. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReedDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReedDiamond">Reed Diamond</a>, playing security chief Laurence Dominic, had similar treatment.
<ul><li> This makes a little more sense in light of Season 2, where both of them are largely written out. Even better, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> received early warning that the show would be canceled and brought them back in for the finales, but who knows how much his <em>original</em> plan involved them.

As of season 11, Vansgness appeared the most out of all the actors, even with original cast members Shemar Moore, Thomas Gibson, and Matthew Gray Gubler (though the former two have since left).
<ul><li> Aisha Tyler appeared in all but four episodes of the eleventh season, though credited as a guest star, which eventually led her to be promoted to the opening credits in the twelfth season.
</li></ul></li><li> In season 4 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights">Friday Night Lights</a>, Zach Gilford was listed as a guest star, despite being a main character for the past three seasons. This was allegedly a gambit so that he could be nominated for Best Guest Role in a Drama Series at the Emmys, which is less competitive than the main and supporting actor categories. It didn't work.
<ul><li> Buddy Garrity, played by Brad Leland, was a fixture of the show for all 5 seasons, appearing in all but 13 episodes, but Leland was never billed above guest star. Even in season 5, where he appeared in every episode.
</li></ul></li><li> In season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek">Dawson's Creek</a></em>, Meredith Monroe and Kerr Smith were both credited as Special Guest Stars. Kerr Smith was in every single episode of the season except the premiere and Meredith Monroe was in all but the finale. They were both upgraded to regulars for the third season.
<ul><li> Busy Phillips stays a guest star throughout the entire 5th season, despite living with one main character and dating another while featuring in 22 out of 23 episodes. (The one she didn't appear in was a Joey-centric episode which none of the main cast but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieHolmes">Katie Holmes</a> appeared in). She actually featured <em>less</em> after her promotion to the main cast in season 6, missing 7 episodes of that season, including the finale.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em>, Michael Hurst was initially credited as a guest star. This was somewhat justified in the first season, as Iolaus only appeared in half the episodes and was established to have a home of his own. However, while he doesn't appear in every episode of Season 2, Iolaus still appears in the majority (even getting his first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a> episode) and is by this time established as a traveling hero like Hercules. In Season 3, Michael Hurst was promoted to the opening credits with "Also Starring."
</li><li> Jesse L. Martin was listed as a guest star throughout all eight episode of <em>The Philanthropist</em>, even though he had a larger role than Neve Campbell, who was given second billing.
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NayaRivera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NayaRivera">Naya Rivera</a> (Santana) was in every episode, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeatherMorris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeatherMorris">Heather Morris</a> (Brittany) all of them but the pilot (both were made regulars in season 2) — Harry Shum Jr. (Mike) has been in every episode so far but the first three, but was billed as a guest star until his third and final season.
<ul><li> This trope was the case in Season 2 for Chord Overstreet (Sam), who appeared in all but one episode of the season. The producers' refusal to upgrade him to main cast member caused him to walk out between season 2 and 3. He returned in episode 8 of season 3, and finally got his main cast billing in season 4.
</li><li> True with all of the new cast members for season four. Most of them have appeared in every episode (and played cental parts too), but they are all billed as guest stars.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak">Prison Break</a></em> has had several - Stacy Keach (Warden Pope) appeared in 20 out of 22 episodes in season 1, Frank Grillo (Nick Savrinn) appeared in 18 out of 22, Muse Watson (Charles Westmoreland) appeared in 18 out of 22, Carlo Alban (<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGrady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGrady">Mc Grady</a>) appeared in every episode in season 3, and Leon Russom (General Jonathan Krantz) appeared in every episode in season 4.
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigTimeRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigTimeRush">Big Time Rush</a></em>, Tanya Chrisholm who plays Gustavo's assistant Kelly, wasn't put on the cast billings, despite being in every episode. The second season however added her to it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShakeItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShakeItUp">Shake it Up</a></em> has Tinka Hessenheffer, who is played by Caroline Sunshine, who appears in every episode along with her twin brother Gunther, but is billed as a recurring character while Gunther is included as a regular in the opening credits. She was promoted to opening credits from the second season onwards.
</li><li> The long-running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritCom">BritCom</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine">Last of the Summer Wine</a></em> always listed (Dame) Thora Hird and Jean Alexander as being special guest appearances which at first they were as they appeared first in Christmas specials but later were in most or all episodes with Jean staying till the end, Dame Thora having died a few years previously.
</li><li> Even though the only episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JoanOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JoanOfArcadia">Joan of Arcadia</a></em> that "guest stars" Becky Wahlstrom and Christopher Marquette weren't in was the pilot, they weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">added to the opening credits</a> until season two.
</li><li> Chris Pratt (Andy) on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em> got this for the first season. He got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promotion to Opening Titles</a> (he was actually always there, just labeled as a "guest star") for season two. Interestingly, he was only supposed to be a temporary character, but that quickly changed before season two.
<ul><li> Retta (Donna) and Jim O'Heir (Jerry) were also billed as guest stars despite appearing in most episodes. However they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles">Promoted to Opening Titles</a> halfway through season 6 after the departure of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RashidaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RashidaJones">Rashida Jones</a> (Ann) and Rob Lowe (Chris).

In seasons 2 and 3, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mads</a> and other visitors were billed under "special guest villains". In all other seasons (including season 1), they were billed under "also featuring", with the Satellite of Love portion of the cast billed under "featuring". Of special note: show creator Joel Hodgson didn't even get credit for playing Joel Robinson in the first season! (Fortunately, he still got credit for everything else he did, and the cast issue was rectified in season 2.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFiveO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFiveO">Hawaii Five-O</a></em>, the original version of, is an unusual case - while Jack Lord receives starring credit and is the only person not to have the name of his character included in his billing, the other cast members aren't officially credited as co-stars; James MacArthur (second-billed in all but the final season, which he wasn't in) and all the other cast members listed in the opening credits are billed under "With."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka">Eureka</a></em>, Chris Gauthier has notably appeared in most episodes of the series and maybe misses 2—3 per season at most, yet still has remained a guest star on the show.
<ul><li> An even better example is Neil Grayston as Douglas Fargo. He's appeared in every episode of the series from the beginning and often plays an important part in the events of an episode (as opposed to Gauthier who often only appears in one scene an episode), yet somehow he didn't get credited as part of the main cast until the beginning of season 3.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> is this trope all over the place.
<ul><li>In five seasons, only 37 actors out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">over ninety characters</a> that appeared regularly or semi-regularly were ever credited in the opening sequence. This includes actors like Clarke Peters, Jim True-Frost, Seth Gilliam, Domenick Lombardozzi, JD Williams, etc., who in all honesty were regulars in every way from the first season onward, but didn't get promoted to the opening titles until later (in some cases, MUCH later).
</li><li>Used still more with actors who were regulars but NEVER got promotion to the opening titles, such as Delaney Williams, Hassan Johnson, Felicia Pearson, Julito McCullum, Maestro Harrell and several others. In the case of the latter two, it was particularly strange since arguably both actors were portraying the central characters of season four.
</li><li>What makes it all the more odd is that the show would frequently introduce new regulars who were only around for one season (Chris Bauer, Paul Ben-Victor, Amy Ryan, Clarke Johnson, Thomas McCarthy, Michelle Paress) or promote background characters to "regular" status (Gbenge Akkinagbe, Neal Huff), or just promote people to the opening credits who'd been with the series for a while, regardless of whether their role increased at all (Michael Kostroff, Isaiah Whitlock, Jr.) without even thinking of promoting the above actors who unquestionably deserved it.
</li><li>Of course, the argument could be made that if everyone on that show who appeared regularly received billing in the opening sequence, the sequence would take up half the episode. However, it does seem odd and random who was and who wasn't credited as a regular.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> does this frequently. Mostly because the show had the same opening titles through seasons 1—7, which only billed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDuchovny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDuchovny">David Duchovny</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson">Gillian Anderson</a> as characters in the show. Everyone else, even highly recurring characters, were guest stars. This continued through season 8, when the credits were changed to reflect David Duchovny's absence from the show, but still only had Gillian Anderson and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPatrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPatrick">Robert Patrick</a> in it. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MitchPileggi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MitchPileggi">Mitch Pileggi</a>, who played Walter Skinner and appeared in 81 episodes, did not get a main title credit until the show's final season, season 9.

After becoming more prominent in the second season he started appearing very frequently as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad">Team Dad</a> and become arguably the most important character after Sam and Dean, yet for some reason was always billed as a guest star, even when you take into consideration that the few other actors aside from the main two to also be billed as series regulars (Katie Cassidy and Lauren Cohan in season 3 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MishaCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MishaCollins">Misha Collins</a> in seasons 5 &amp; 6) actually appeared in <em>less</em> episodes in their seasons than he did (with the exception of Collins in the fifth season). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though with Bobby recently being killed off thus limiting his appearances, his role as a guest star is a bit more justified now.</span>
<ul><li> There was actually a bit of a push from the fans of the show to make him a regular cast member around the same time Misha Collins became one. Beaver actually spoke out against this, saying he was flattered by their concern, but it just wasn't necessary, as his status as a guest star left him free to float in and out and work on other projects if he wanted to, and becoming a regular cast member wouldn't allow him that.

This may be partly due to the fact that Al, his character, was meant to be a temporary replacement for the intended Tool Time assistant during the original actor's unavailability, and managed to stick around instead. (Interestingly, Earl Hindman's credit is the only one in the season 1 opener not to portray the actor, perhaps in keeping with Wilson's "invisible" status. He showed up starting in season 2.)

Due to her salary dispute, Suzanne Somers had her appearances reduced to only the tag scene of each episode, and Jenilee's character Cindy moved into the apartment as the replacement roommate. Instead of making a new credit sequence mid-season, they simply kept the one that listed Suzanne as a star and credited Jenilee at the end of each episode as a guest, even though, for all intents and purposes, it was the other way around.

<ul><li> Tom Price as Andy Davidson has also appeared in fourteen TV episodes, a couple of the radio episodes, and has narrated a number of the audio books (a job usually reserved for the series' lead actors). In Series 3 and 4 in particular he appears in more than half of the episodes, and has more appearances to his name than the new leads introduced in those series, but is still billed below them as a guest star.

However, she's then killed off in the third season premiere. If anything, this act may have helped with the surprise of her death - if Lotz had been credited as a regular in the second season and then a guest star just in the third, it would have been pretty apparent to the viewers that she wasn't going to survive the episode.
</li><li> Interestingly played with regarding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieCassidy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieCassidy">Katie Cassidy</a>. She is part of the original cast members of <em>Arrow</em> and gets the regular credit. However, her character is killed off in Season 4, but Cassidy continues to be a part of the Arrowverse, albeit playing a doppelganger of her character, who guest stars in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash</a></em>. When said doppelganger appears in <em>Arrow</em> Season 5, Cassidy is credited with "special guest star" since she only appears in three of the season's 23 episodes. The next season, she is promoted to series regular again, but instead of simply updating her to regular credit, she gets "with", which makes her kind of a guest star. The singling out carries on until the end of the series; the final season updates her to "special appearance by", the same as Matt Ryan below.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattRyan">Matt Ryan</a> retains his "special appearance by" credit for every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em>, even after joining the main cast in Season 4.
</li><li> Gary Green has been a constant face in <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> since Season 3. Despite this, Adam Tsekhman is always credited as a guest star. This continues to Season 5, where Tsekhman is still a main character but continues to be credited as guest, yet Olivia Swann (Astra Logue), who debuts in the final two episodes of Season 4, is immediately promoted to series regular when Season 5 is confirmed.

</li><li> Mackenzie Lintz as Norrie on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnderTheDome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnderTheDome">Under the Dome</a></em> appeared in every episode of the first season and was fairly important to the plot throughout <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as one of the Four Hands</span>, but didn't get credited as a regular until season 2.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em> always had an interesting relationship with leads v. guest stars. The actor portraying Ms Dent was listed as main cast in Season 1, despite only appearing for a handful of scenes over four episodes (and disappearing from the credits, though not promotional materials, after seven). In Seasons 2 and 3, new one-season-arc characters Jackie, Piz and Parker were promoted to leads above some recurring co-stars who played equally significant roles in all three seasons. Season 1 recurring characters Dick and Cassidy were promoted to lead cast in Season 2, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though it's rumoured that Dick was only promoted to disguise the fact that Cassidy's promotion was due to him being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the season, as his role didn't really expand until Season 3</span>. Meanwhile in all this, Tina Majorino as "Mac" appeared in at least as many or more episodes than Dick, Cassidy and Jackie, played a more significant role in the main plot than two of the three, yet wasn't promoted to lead credits until Season 3, along with Michael Muhney as Don Lamb, another actor who'd been with the show since the first season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz">Oz</a></em> is this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Most seasons are only 8 episodes long (except for season 4 which had 16) so many characters appear in every episode. Perhaps the most egregious example of this is George Morforgen as Bob who appeared in every single episode of the series but never received starring billing.
<ul><li> <em>Oz</em> had three levels of billing for its opening credits during the first two seasons: Starring, Also Starring and Guest Starring. Ernie Hudson, Terry Kinney, Harold Perrineau and Eamonn Walker were the only ones billed as "Starring" for the first season, while Kirk Acevedo, Edie Falco, Rita Moreno, Tony Musante, Leon, JK Simmons, Lee Tergeson, Sean Whitesell, Dean Winters and BD Wong were "Also Starring". In the second season, Acevedo, Moreno, Simmons and Tergeson were moved up to "Starring" while Adewale Akinnouye-Agbage, eljko Ivanek, George Morfogen and Lauren Velez were moved up to "Also Starring". With the exception of Ivanek, every new addition to the "Also Starring" list had appeared prominently in every episode of the first season. The "Guest Starring" billing disappeared from the opening credits of seasons three to six, which meant that many actors were credited as "Also Starring" despite only appearing in one or two episodes. Numerous "Also Starring" and "Guest Starring" actors played major characters on the series, despite never being moved up to "Starring" or, in some cases, ever being credited as regulars. Philip Scozzarella, Otto Sanchez, Carl DiMaggio, Timothy L. Brown, Steven Wishnoff, Blake Robbins and many others too numerous to mention never had their names in the opening credits at all, despite appearing as major characters for entire seasons, or longer, and others like Granville Adams, Robert Clohessy, Seth Gilliam, Tom Mardirosian, Craig "muMs" Grant, Kristen Rohde, JD Williams Scott William Winters were listed as "Guest Starring" for the first two seasons, and only became "regulars" by virtue of the "Guest Starring" billing being removed. All of them played major characters.

It's especially jarring since it made Cox into a bigger celebrity than any of the actual main stars. Season 3 added Ruby Rose as Stella, who also wasn't credited as a lead actress but quickly soared to superstardom immediately upon the season's launch.

Bullock as the original mentor character who instead remained a side character). As such, key players like Christian Serratos, Kyle Swann, Carlie Casey, Don Creech, and Hamilton Mitchell were never given anything other than guest credits.

Then we were introduced to Antoine "Trip" Triplett (B.J. Britt) who joined the team in the latter half of the first season and was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeGuestStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeGuestStar">Fake Guest Star</a> for the remainder of that season and the first half of the second.

Not so lucky was Alphonse "Mac" Mackenzie (Henry Simmons) who appeared in literally every episode of the second season, credited as a guest star for all of them. This might have been a way to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fool viewers into thinking his supposed betrayal then supposed departure would be permanent. He was promoted to regular for the third season</span>.
<ul><li> On the antagonists' side, Ruth Negga (Raina) first appeared in 1x05 and appeared five more times over the of Season 1; in Season 2, she's in about half the episodes (as is lead-credited <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">antagonist</span> Brett Dalton), but is still credited as a guest star, despite having more appearances to her name than any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> she's acted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> for, and despite appearing at several publicity events with the original six leads between seasons.

</li><li> Deke Shaw appears in most of the fifth season's episodes, but his actor, Jeff Ward, is credited only as a guest star. This was likely done to hide the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deke gets sent back to the present</span>, and he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningTitles">Promoted to Opening Titles</a> for the final two seasons.

Also, since they're just voices, none of Kirby's animated characters' voice actors are in the opening credits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger">Henry Danger</a></em>: Michael D. Cohen (Schwoz) has appeared in almost every episode of the show ever since he was introduced. It wasn't until season 5 where he finally got upgraded to the opening credits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThundermans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThundermans">The Thundermans</a></em>: Dana Snyder, the voice of Dr. Colosso (and his live-action actor whenever he turns human), appears in all but a few episodes, but doesn't make it past guest-star status because first, he is only a voice, and second, his near-perfect attendance record still isn't a match for the other Thundermans' 100% attendance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist (2017)</a></em>: With her screen time and importance to the plot exceeding that of some of the leads, Wai Ching Ho (Madame Gao) fits the bill. This would continue into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">The Defenders (2017)</a></em>.
</li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">The Defenders (2017)</a></em>, Jessica Henwick is a perfect example. The show is a crossover between the four main Marvel Netflix shows: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016">Luke Cage (2016)</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist (2017)</a></em>, and as such, only their actors and the main villains received top billing. Colleen Wing is a former member of The Hand, and is actually far more relevant to the main plot than Luke or Jessica, whose involvement in the miniseries felt <em>extremely</em> forced at times. But as Danny Rand's girlfriend, she's relegated to supporting status along with all the other love interests and best friends. This is actually consistent with some criticisms of <em>Iron Fist</em>, as many people felt <em>she</em> should have been the main character due to having the more compelling story arc.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SEALTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SEALTeam">SEAL Team</a></em>, Lt. Commander Eric Blackburn appears in every single episode of Season 1, but his actor Judd Lormand is only credited as a guest star. (He was promoted to series regular for Season 2.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred">The 4400</a></em>: Richard Kahan (Marco) appears in 32 of the series' 44 episodes, more than any other guest star. He is the only actor to appear in all four seasons without ever being part of the regular cast.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChavoDelOcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChavoDelOcho">El Chavo del ocho</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChapulinColorado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChapulinColorado">El Chapulín Colorado</a></em>, the actors that take part of each episode are listed in the introduction. If a character from another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chespirito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chespirito">Chespirito</a></em> skit appears (e.g. El Chavo and Quico in a Chapulín Colorado episode), they are listed as a guest star, even if the actor that plays them was already billed.
</li><li> Odd case involving Jenna von Oy on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blossom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blossom">Blossom</a></em>. von Oy had been cast as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix">Six</a> LeMure in the series' pilot and was originally in the opening credits, only to also be cast on the short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> sitcom <em>Lenny</em> (starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEponymousShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEponymousShow">comedian Lenny Clarke</a>); which like <em>Blossom</em> was also created by Don Reo and shared most of the same production personnel (from Wit/Thomas Productions), resulting in von Oy being moved to "Special Guest Star" billing when <em>Blossom</em> premiered in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidseasonReplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidseasonReplacement">January 1991</a>. Eventually, <em>Lenny</em> was canceled in March 1991; and by the start of the 1991-92 season (incidentally, the first full season for <em>Blossom</em>) von Oy had been moved back to the opening credits.

They appeared in almost every episode of the show, but the show got cancelled before they could move up.

One of the underlying conflicts in the series is Gregg's desire to be promoted to co-reviewer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAndEric" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAndEric">Tim Heidecker</a>'s refusal to grant this or share the show.
</li><li> For some reason, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Sips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Sips">Sips</a> refers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LewisBrindley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LewisBrindley">Lewis Brindley</a> as a "special guest" in the description for his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod">Garry's Mod</a></em> series, even though Lewis has been in almost every session of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TroubleInTerroristTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TroubleInTerroristTown">Trouble in Terrorist Town</a></em> for at least two sessions (read: multiple rounds throughout many videos, ending at one point and then starting anew). The most likely explanation is that he started as a guest but then kept playing, and Sips just forgot to change the text.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>, Ray Gillette never appears in the main credits despite having appeared regularly for every season. This probably is because he's voiced by the series creator, Adam Reed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> voice actors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenTom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenTom">Lauren Tom</a> (Amy), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilLaMarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilLaMarr">Phil LaMarr</a> (Hermes) and David Herman (various characters, most notably Scruffy) were always "guest stars" during the original run, despite the fact that at least one of them appeared in every episode (although, in Season 4, they did get their own caption instead of having to share one). In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> run, Tom, LaMarr, and Herman gained starring credits.
<ul><li> This appears to be a pattern for Lauren Tom, who also got guest billing for voicing Connie and Minh on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The voice actors for the recurring villains on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> are always listed as guest stars, even though two of them (Sullivan and John DiMaggio) are in <em>half</em> the episodes (sometimes as characters other than their primary villains).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Whenever Edna Krabappel appeared, Marcia Wallace was billed as a guest star. Edna was the <em>only</em> character the late Marcia Wallace voiced (she could have been included in the regular cast like Yeardley Smith, who also only voices one character, but decided against it). She also received guest star credit whenever Edna appeared, <em>even if she doesn't say anything</em>. She's billed in appearing in <em>176 episodes.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman">Phil Hartman</a> had a similar thing going on, being credited in 55 episodes at the time of his death in the tenth season (which meant he appeared in about one of every four). Unlike Wallace, Hartman's credits were spread out among a large number of characters, between his "regulars" (Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure) and various one-offs (Evan Conover, Lyle Lanley, 'Smooth' Jimmy Apollo).
</li><li> Maggie Roswell, somewhat infamously, was basically treated as a guest star despite voicing Helen Lovejoy, Maude Flanders, Luann Van Houten, and Ms. Hoover, all of whom appeared fairly regularly, and even got nominated for an Emmy and an Annie while working on the show. Fox only paid her $1500 an episode, despite the fact that she had to fly from Colorado to California to record episodes, and had her pay her travel costs on her own dime—the resulting dispute led to Maude being killed off and most of Roswell's characters being retired for several seasons. Even with that gap in mind, she's still been in 243 episodes as of this writing, more than both of the above combined.
</li><li> Pamela Hayden and Russi Taylor voice (or voiced) pretty much all the kids who aren't Lisa or voiced by Nancy Cartwright, while Tress MacNeille voices most of the older women who aren't voiced by Marcia Wallace or Maggie Roswell. Russi Taylor at the time of her death had appeared in 195 episodes, while Hayden and MacNeille both have around triple that as of this writing. Over six hundred episodes, and still an "Also Starring..."
