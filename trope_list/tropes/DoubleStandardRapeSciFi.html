Indeed, it is stated several times that even temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potions</a> are actually <em>illegal</em> in Magical society, probably due to how effective a date rape drug they would be.

That Bulma was specifically dating the "real" Yamcha and <em>not</em> the teenager now in Yamcha's body, which Bulma is ignorant about, is unaddressed and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">Bed Trick</a> angle is presented as romantic.

<ul><li> Issue 200 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> involved such an incident, which was so infamous that it would later be dubbed "The Rape of Ms. Marvel", which involved limbo-stranded villain Marcus kidnapping her and using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> to create a fantasy romance world to seduce and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">impregnate Carol Danvers with himself</a>, erase her memory and send her back with a phantom pregnancy that led to Marcus being "reborn" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging">Rapid Aged</a> to adulthood, and Carol falling in love with him and going back to Limbo with him, all of which the Avengers were cool with. It wasn't originally intended or perceived as squicky until much later, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a> wrote an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> of Carol returning from Limbo and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calling out the Avengers for not helping her</a>. These days it has been inverted to the point that the incident can't be referred to <em>without</em> calling it a rape or a violation. This was very much glossed over in the decade that followed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> created a similar situation in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> triangle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewXMen">New X-Men</a></em>, where Emma, acting as Scott's therapist, convinces him that the best treatment for his PTSD was to have psychic sex then and there. No one, save Jean has any issue with this, (and even then, it's treated no worse than an act of seduction) and Professor X even goes so far as to <em>defend</em> her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>: Another problematic case was during <em>Brand New Day</em>, when Spider-Man and the Black Cat decided to have anonymous sex. This was preconditioned on the fact that thanks to the "Blind Spot", a techno-magic spell of forgetting enacted by Doctor Strange, Iron Man and Mr. Fantastic at Spidey's request, the Black Cat had forgotten that she knew Spider-Man's secret identity (which meant that her memories of more than twenty years' worth of continuity were seriously re-edited). She even made it clear that she would not have entered an affair with Spider-Man if she knew who he really was because she wanted to avoid the emotional involvement. But could this wish not to find out who she was sleeping with be considered truly consensual if one of the effects of the Blind Spot was to make people care about remembering that they once knew who Spider-Man was in his civilian identity but now no longer did?
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a></em> where Starfox is tried for rape, being accused by a married woman who came onto and had sex with him while under the influence of his psychic hormones. He is also accused of doing this to She-Hulk although it turns out he didn't. Prior to this storyline, there's not much sign that he actually uses pheromones like that and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch">it was eventually resolved</a> by having a reveal that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a> had brain-damaged him so that he lost conscious control of his powers, but that he never consciously used his powers that way on anyone who wasn't already looking for a casual sex partner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Raven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Raven">Raven</a>'s powers were fully unlocked, she started subconsciously pulling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick Grayson</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalAffair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalAffair">shared dreams of them getting it on</a>, except that Dick was with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starfire">Starfire</a> and he'd wake up from these dreams with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatapultNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatapultNightmare">Catapult Nightmare</a>. It was quasi-averted in the sense that Raven wasn't fully aware Dick didn't share her feelings and horrified when she found out what she was doing to him.
</li><li> Mirage arrived in the series by knocking Kory out and impersonating her so she could have Dick as her boyfriend, sex included. She was never called to account for this, even when she taunted Dick over not recognizing her in front of his teammates.
</li></ul></li><li> In an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>, the Chameleon pretends to be Peter Parker and has sex with Peter's roommate. The writer acknowledged it was a violation but didn't consider it "rape" and the resulting backlash led the writer to hastily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> it into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">"they were just making out"</a> but it still left a bad taste in the fans' mouths.
</li><li> Accusations of this has been leveled at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a>: Issue 22</em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Dr. Otto Octavius</a></span> in Peter Parker's body has sex with Anna Marconi. Initially he broke up with Mary Jane because continuing Peter's relationship would eventually become rape by deceit, but the author insists that's not the case now because Anna didn't know Peter before the switcheroo happened.
</li><li> Averted in Joe Kelly's run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a></em>, where Typhoid Mary uses a holographic image inducer to pose as his crush, Siryn. Deadpool's horror and disgust at finding out the morning after definitely isn't played for laughs, and serves as Mary crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>.
</li><li> Averted in the series <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubMariner">Namor the Submariner</a>: Llyra, who previously killed Namor's wife, uses her shapeshifter abilities to have sex with the titular hero. Namor all but states that it was a rape ("There is a word for what she did to me, Susan") and goes to crush her skull with his hand, only to be stopped when she claims she's pregnant.
</li><li> In <em>DC Super Stars</em> #12, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy">Superboy</a>'s identity is discovered by a new classmate named Misty, and the two quickly fall in love. It is heavily implied that Clark loses his virginity to Misty, thus playing into the story's theme of leaving childhood behind and becoming an adult (as this was ultimately the tale of how Superboy became Super<em>man</em>). However, at the very end of the issue, it turns out that Misty was kidnapped and "programmed" into loving Clark as part of a final test from his robotic tutor. The tutor returns Misty to her hometown and states that she won't remember Superboy's identity or her time as his girlfriend, but nobody ever stops to address how <em>seriously</em> screwed up it is that the robot kidnapped some random girl and then brainwashed her into having sex with Clark.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a></em>, Kate Kane was for a time hypnotized into an abusive sexual relationship with the vampire Nocturna.

</li><li> Phantom Rider's treatment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mockingbird">Bobbi Morse</a> in <em>West Coast Avengers</em> was an early semi-subversion. The Rider, who was a hero originally but had gone off the deep end at that point, used a magic potion to make her think she was his lover, and kept her like that for some time. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">did not take it well</a> when the spell was broken, and killed/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByInaction">did not try very hard to save</a> the Rider, once she had told him how she felt about it. It was played straighter by some of her fellow Avengers, however, who found <em>her</em> conduct blameworthy. Most shockingly, her own <em>husband</em> Hawkeye (Clint Barton) took Bobbi to task for this, enraged that his wife not only broke one of the Avengers biggest rules (no killing), but also lied to him about it.
<ul><li> It should be noted, however, that the Avengers by and large were pretty much on Mockingbird's side with this, as Tigra and Moon Knight quit in support of the resigning Bobbi, and the Wasp, Henry Pym, the Scarlet Witch and the Vision calling Hawkeye out on his insensitivity, pigheadedness and non-support of his wife. But tragically, the larger issue as portrayed in the story was the Avengers non-killing policy, and not the fact that Mockingbird had been <em>repeatedly raped</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Alias">Alias</a></em>. Jessica Jones recounts how Kilgrave would use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">Compelling Voice</a> power to force college girls to sleep with him, while forcing Jessica herself to watch and wish it was her in their place. This is treated as being as horrible as it should be and left Jessica with severe PTSD after she escaped him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> has wandered into this trope a few times:
<ul><li> Karolina and Xavin's entire relationship depends upon Karolina's sincere belief that Xavin is a girl, because Karolina is a lesbian and is not in the least bit attracted to guys. Xavin, however, is genderfluid, and frequently adopts a male form, and there is no explicit confirmation that they've ever really spelled out to Karolina that their male form is as much a part of their identity as their female form, which raises a whole lot of questions about informed consent that the series doesn't really address.
</li><li> In the final arc of the third series, Nico has sex with Chase while he's still under the effects of a spell designed to make him passive, even as he tells her that he's not interested in her. Within the arc itself, it's treated as a serious violation, and Chase quits the team in disgust over it. But in later appearances, the whole thing is treated as just another of Nico's bad decisions.

<ul><li> An incomplete <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em> fanfic titled <em>You'll Be Well Done!</em> plays with this trope, with Kefka trying to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeByProxy">Rape by Proxy</a> on Terra by using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">lust-inducing potion</a>, which he has stolen from Ultimecia, to set Sephiroth on Terra's trail. Sephiroth, unaware at first of the fact that his sudden distracting lust for Terra is potion-induced, subsequently visits Ultimecia to request a small flask of the same lust potion, intending to use it to make Terra easier to beguile.
<ul><li> Sephiroth doesn't definitively state to Ultimecia whether his reason for seducing Terra by means of the potion is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptTheCutie">sway her all-too-willingly back into serving Chaos</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheAnnoyance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheAnnoyance">boost her power with some really good sex so that she can and will remove Kefka from Chaos's ranks by killing the mad harlequin</a>, but in either case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">for him to harm Terra in any way would be counterproductive to both goals</a>. He's not above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">causing Cloud to fear the worst on Terra's account</a>, however, as proven when he kidnaps Terra on the Onion Knight's watch in order to send a witness (the Onion Knight) running to Cloud for help.
</li><li> Overall, the entire narrative treats Sephiroth's decision to ensure Terra's pleasure during the resulting sexual encounter, through the use of the lust potion, as the lesser evil - if only when compared to what Kefka originally intended. Especially when Kefka, enraged at the failure of <em>his</em> plan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">blasts Sephiroth and Terra both to within an inch of their lives with his Light of Judgment</a>.

</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Cloud</strong> <em>(to Warrior of Light; indirectly to Firion and Onion Knight)</em>: If I'm angry, it's not with Terra. I already know that anything she did was because Sephiroth made her do it. And even if I did hold it against her that she fell for his trickery, I see that Kefka already punished her.

<ul><li> In the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandraBullock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandraBullock">Sandra Bullock</a> film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LovePotionNumberNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LovePotionNumberNine">Love Potion Number Nine</a></em> Bullock and her platonic male friend get access to a potion that, when sprayed into someone's mouth, alters their voice to make them much more attractive to the opposite sex. Apparently the fact that it doesn't <em>directly</em> affect the target dodges the rape bullet in the minds of the filmmakers, since the guy uses it to have sex with <em>an entire sorority</em> (among other women).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited">X2: X-Men United</a></em>, Mystique attempts to do this to Wolverine by shifting to look like Jean. She's on top of him and they're shedding clothes before he realizes who she truly is. Plays on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">All Men Are Perverts</a> when she proceeds to turn herself into Storm and Rogue (who is effectively his teenager sidekick/surrogate daughter), suggesting one of them might be what he "really wants", something that visibly disgusts him. It's not quite so bad in the novelization, when Wolverine knows it's Mystique the entire time but chooses to play along for a while.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Enemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Enemy">Enemy</a></em>, both of the doubles impersonate the other one to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">have sex with the others' girlfriend/wife respectively</a>.
</li><li> The comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInventionOfLying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInventionOfLying">The Invention of Lying</a></em>, plays with this trope. Set in a world where nobody (except the main character) are even capable of lying or conceiving of the idea of lying, the main character lies and tells an attractive woman the world will come to an end unless they have sex. However, when it comes time to do the deed (which would be rape by deception), he backs down and tells the woman that the world will be fine.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Descendants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Descendants">Descendants</a></em>, Ben brushes off Mal's drugging him with a magic potion as something she did out of misguided love, and after one conversation they never mention it again (and become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>). Even worse, he was dating another girl when Mal drugged him. To be fair though, since this is a Disney movie there's no actual sex involved; they don't even kiss.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamscape">Dreamscape</a></em>, the main character tests out his dream-walking abilities by entering the romantically-toned dream of one of his doctors, and they make out in her compartment of the train she's dreaming about. Upon waking, she's angry at him for doing so, but she's more outraged by his violation of her mental privacy than by any implication of sexual assault. At the film's end, the pair board a real train, and speculate about whether it'll be "as good" in real life, so evidently she thought of the actual dream-sex as just a first hook-up in an unusual setting.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellComesToFrogtown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellComesToFrogtown">Hell Comes To Frogtown</a></em>, the main characters find one of the fertile woman they're trying to rescue, but she's uncooperative and they end up tying her up and injecting her with hormones. For some reason they've brought along Sam, one of the few fertile men left on the trip, and he's forced to "get to work." The next morning she's pregnant and grateful. This seems to be a theme with Sam; his backstory reveals that he raped a woman who changed her story once she discovered she was pregnant. The world needs to be repopulated, after all.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsTheCrimesOfGrindelwald">Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</a></em>. Queenie slips Jacob a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potion</a> after he refuses to marry her. However, it's not because he doesn't love her (he very much does), but rather because she's a witch and he's a Muggle. Marriage between the two of them is illegal and he doesn't want to get her in trouble. Still, when Newt discovers what she's done, he's appalled and undoes the enchantment.
</li><li> In the pornographic film parody of the Incredible Hulk tv series, just like the original, Dr. Banner's female colleague has a one-sided crush on Banner. So when he transforms, she has sex with Hulk and denies it later when he suspects.

<ul><li> From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a>, we have Zeus, who has absolutely no qualms about sleeping with women while disguised as their husbands. While Zeus is a rapist regardless, this is usually portrayed as better, since the wives were technically faithful.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ArthurianLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ArthurianLegend">Arthurian Legend</a>:
<ul><li> Galahad was conceived by Elaine magically disguising herself as Guinevere and sleeping with Lancelot, and depending on the version it's <em>Lancelot</em> who gets punished for this.
</li><li> Mordred was conceived by Morgause or Morgan le Fey disguised as her brother's wife.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in Wicca and some other magical circles, where love magic is common but outright enchanting someone to fall in love with you is considered a violation of consent. In these cases, the practitioner usually enchants themselves to find a significant other, and couples make magic together or with their partner's consent.
</li><li> In Japanese folklore, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune">kitsune</a></em> — as well as their Chinese and Korean counterparts — use their shapeshifting abilities and other mystical powers to transform into beautiful women and seduce men, usually to drain their vitality through sex or outright eat them. In cases where the ruse is revealed — either by accident or the intervention of a priest or exorcist — the fox's unwitting lover is usually horrified and disgusted. However, in other cases — like the tale of <em>Kuzunoha</em> — the human and the fox-spirit genuinely fall in love, though such romances almost always end in tragedy when the <em>kitsune</em>'s true form is revealed.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake">Anita Blake</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfLove">a scene</a> between Anita and Micah that is not supposed to be rape. Even though she said, "No," several times, and Micah didn't stop. Anita and Micah are destined mates because of the <em>ardeur</em>, which gets this sort of treatment regularly, due to forcing Anita and whoever's close to have sex, occasionally forcing rape on both parties. This scene was so controversial, in fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">that it was slightly rewritten for the paperback release</a>.
</li><li> In addition, the series contains at least three incidences where a victim falls in love with a mind-controlling vampire, which is treated as somewhat acceptable.
</li><li> Anita regularly uses her <em>ardeur</em> to force men to have sex with her. Due to the series's rampant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">Protagonist-Centered Morality</a>, this is always treated as a morally acceptable thing for her to do and the only people who try to refuse are treated as scum who (literally) deserve to be hunted down and killed.
</li></ul></li><li> The Formics, colloquially known as "Buggers" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em>, are revealed near the end to have a rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicky</a> reproductive process, due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a>. According to the last queen's memories, soon after the new queen hatches, the older queen sends a number of her specially prepared males (glorified drones) to the birthing chamber, where each of them penetrates the young queen and then promptly dies, "shuddering in ecstasy." From a human point of view, that sounds almost exactly like a little girl being gang-raped. This is arguably justified, however, by these <em>not</em> being humans, and by sex not having anything like the same social significance to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> in control of each of their civilizations that it does to us; moreover, this truly is the only way they can reproduce. Further questions of consent are raised in the sequels, when it is revealed that not all of the male drones are born mindless; some have to be telepathically "broken" before they can enter the hive mind. The main character says something along the lines of it being a moral question to consider after another generation or two of coexistence and learning about one another as a species, but one wonders if he would have been so cavalier if it had been a more humanoid species (such as the mammalian piggies) that systematically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Raped</a> and then literally raped every male born with free will.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em>, the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potions</a> varies between comic and deathly serious:
<ul><li> Initially, Fred and George sell love potions legally and their use is treated as funny by the story when another female student tries to give Harry one, though Ron accidentally ingests it so the reader never finds out how far things would have gone if she had been successful.
</li><li> Then it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> when Merope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Voldemort's</a> mother, forces Tom Riddle Sr. into their relationship via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potion</a>, which Dumbedore theorizes was a preferred alternative to the unforgivable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Imperius Curse</a> to reinforce the delusion that Tom Sr. was really in love with her. And the only moral problem with this is that she's having sex with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a>...or so it seems, at first. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">However</a>, this way of looking at the morality of her actions turn out to be limited to the views of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Death Eaters</a> and similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">pure-blood advocates</a>. Tom Sr. acts with utter revulsion once the potion wears off, and Dumbledore refers to what Merope did as enslavement by magical means. The reader is left with an impression that Voldemort's refusing to see his mother as a rapist (instead blaming his father for abandoning his son after Merope stopped giving him the potion, thinking he'd stay for the sake of their baby) is a big part of why he became so hateful toward Muggles.
</li><li> Overall it seems like a consequence of the series getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>. A love potion can be treated like a joke in a children's book but you start to think harder about a joke shop selling magical roofies to schoolchildren and the consequences are much more disturbing. Alternately, it could be that A) Love Potions are only a problem if used over an extended period of time, and/or B) there are different sorts of love potions with varying potency.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ez5p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ez5p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ez5p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The strongest is known as Amortentia, but the notes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfBeedleTheBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfBeedleTheBard">The Tales of Beedle the Bard</a></em> at least seem to imply there are several kinds of love potions as there are people actually experimenting and trying to find the perfect one.</span> All that is certain is that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potion</a> can only cause severe infatuation or lust, not real connection.

The most jarring part is that Ron himself was once victim of a love potion as mentioned above.
</li><li> Veela have an effect on human men similar to a love potion. This one is significantly muddled by the fact that Veela <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToTurnYouOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToTurnYouOn">can't turn it off.</a>

<ul><li> The glamour spell, the series' equivalent of this, is seen by characters as tantamount to rape. Sorceresses who use it are either executed or expelled from the Palace of the Prophets (the Palace has a spell which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">slows down aging to about 10%</a>, so there is little difference between the two for the exiles). On the other hand, the Confessors' power literally makes a person touched by it their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingSmiliesPaintedOnYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingSmiliesPaintedOnYourSoul">devoted slave</a> forever. While that's all problematic enough, it crosses into rape territory because having sex causes them to lose control of their power, Confessing whoever they do it with. This means that there were only two recorded cases of a Confessor able to have a mate who <em>isn't</em> forced to consent with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">mind control</a>, and these cases were <em>3,000 years apart</em>. Bear in mind that Confessors are on the <em>good</em> side, and this isn't treated as rape. Not that it is actually viewed as a good thing - it's merely the only way to promote the Confessor lines, which are essential to their legal system.
</li><li> Confession is also literally the most feared punishment in the setting, to the point that people are more prone to flee at the sight of the uniform than they are when they see a wizard coming, and most wizards are essentially walking weapons of mass destruction with 'maim' as their lowest setting. Enough people commit suicide rather than submit to confession, guilty or innocent, that it's a large practical problem for the legal system. If anything, the setting takes rape a bit <em>more</em> seriously than real life values would actually require.
</li><li> The Confessors themselves hate the effect of their power, too, and specifically take mates they <em>don't</em> have feelings for since they can't bear to do that with a man they love. Which still carries some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>, since they <em>do</em> take mates.
</li><li> In <em>Faith of the Fallen</em> Nicci puts a spell on Kahlan, so she will suffer whatever Nicci suffers, but tenfold, and uses it to have Richard following her. After that, she first tries to seduce Richard then, since she fails, doesn't fight when a local thug, Gadi, rapes her, so that Kahlan with feel it. The fact that she lured him on purpose doesn't change the fact that Gadi is a rapist (since he didn't have to do it and ignored consent), but it does mean that Nicci is effectively raping Kahlan. It's never brought up again. May double as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnFemale">Double Standard: Rape, Female on Female</a> as well.
</li><li> A variation in <em>Temple of the Winds</em>. While there is no direct magic compulsion, the condition to access said temple (which they must enter) are two arranged marriages (Richard with Nadine, Kahlan with Drefan) that have to be consumed immediately. The fact that they have no choice and are couples that would never have been together otherwise, making it rape by coercion, is never brought up (as an added bonus, there is a mundane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">Bed Trick</a> also involved that gets glossed over as well).

The first book even has F'lar considering that if their dragons weren't involved, his relationship with Lessa would have to be considered rape. Since it was written in 1968, there's major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">values dissonance</a> going on (and that's not even getting into how much he slaps her and shakes her around to show his concern about her putting herself in harm's way).
</li><li> Generally averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>, where just about all forms of supernaturally coercing sex are considered bad mojo, whether it is shapeshifting, faerie glamours, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">White Court's mental whammy</a>.

Later in the series, the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luccio was only in a relationship with Harry due to being mind-controlled into doing so by the Black Council</span> is treated as disturbing for both of them.
<ul><li> Arguably not averted in the case of love potions. At one point Harry, who generally is against them, makes one to appease Bob (Harry wasn't planning on actually <em>using</em> it, Bob just insisted on making one in exchange for helping him with a spell). Upon accidentally drinking it, his date for the evening practically rapes him despite the fact that they are in deadly danger and so much as a toe over the line in their small pentagram will kill them both. Possibly the potion was much stronger than Harry intended, as he sometimes doesn't know his own power and the making of the potion was heavily influenced by Bob. It may well be that the potion was intended only to turn someone on, not make them mad with lust.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em> series, also by Jim Butcher, makes an effort to avoid this but there are still instances where people are coerced into having sex why having their arousal manipulated with Earthcrafting.

These incidents range from being played for laughs to being romantic moments, even though Nora usually is disturbed or upset by them.
</li><li> In the <em>Anna Strong Chronicles</em>, the eponymous heroine gets raped by a vampire, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent">mind controls her into compliance.</a> When she recalls the incident, she argues that because she was a willing participant (even though, you know, <em>mind control</em>) it couldn't have been rape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight">The House of Night</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's established that it's immensely pleasurable for both parties when a vampire drinks a human's blood. Early on, Zoey accidentally drinks Heath's blood, establishing a spiritual bond between them. There are several ensuing cases where Heath demands that Zoey drink his blood, even though she repeatedly tells him that she hates doing it and is disgusted by the fact that she finds blood tasty. Heath's arguments come across as very disturbing (for example, telling Zoey she really <em>does</em> want to do it and thus should), and he always wears down Zoey's will by cutting himself and letting her be intoxicated by the smell of his blood. These interactions are treated by Zoey as inconveniences, even though they are disturbingly similar to date rape via drugging. It also goes both ways, since Heath clearly is addicted to the pleasure of having her drink his blood, and continues to cut himself to get her to do so. The text does try to specify the difference between Zoey and Heath's relationship and the undead vampires forcibly drinking his blood later (which he describes as creepy and not like her drinking from him at all), but those situations still come across as pretty unsettling.
</li><li> This comes across in quite a few backstory relationships between humans and vampires, since the bite of a vampire tends to have a drug-like effect on humans, making it questionable exactly how consensual their long-term relationships with vampires are. For example, in <em>Betrayed</em> and <em>Chosen</em>, it's mentioned in passing that Bram Stoker became obsessed with a female vampire after she drank his blood, and went insane when she left him to devote herself to her work as High Priestess, writing <em>Dracula</em> in revenge. Zoey's mother, upon hearing this, comments that the whole thing sounds horrible, while Zoey yells at her for being intolerant of what apparently was treated as a perfectly healthy romance.
</li><li> Zigzagged when Stark mind-controls a fledgling and then almost rapes her. Zoey and her friends immediately condemn this as sexual assault, but as soon as Zoey decides she can redeem Stark, she walks it back to mild euphemisms like "extracurricular biting" and "not so nice past".

Throughout the story the woman wonders if she's basically raping the alien as she has no way of communicating with it, let alone telling if it's really consenting or even sentient to begin with.
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClandestineDaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClandestineDaze">Clandestine Daze</a></em> series where dopplegangers are capable of becoming other individuals both mentally and emotionally. Z knows that sleeping with his targets' significant others would be rape and is revolted at the prospect. Not the least because he has to kill them in order to assume their shape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForgottenBeastsOfEld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForgottenBeastsOfEld">The Forgotten Beasts of Eld</a></em>: Sybil's mother probably didn't consent to have sex with her father, since he called her to him with magic and she's described as being afraid of him. Sybil thinks her maternal grandfather, Lord Horst of Hilt, might be unwelcoming to her given this, yet neither any characters or the text ever describe her conception as even <em>possibly</em> due to rape.
</li><li> In the first book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonvarld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonvarld">Dragonvarld</a></em>, two different factions want Melisande to have a child, and neither bothers with getting her consent. One side physically attacks her, which is properly treated as villainous and horrific. However, the other side overrode her ability to choose just as effectively by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">drugging her</a>, and that's treated as mere distasteful meddling. Granted, she did actually show signs of attraction to the (unwitting and also drugged) third party she was left with, but there was no indication she'd have acted on it without the potion.
</li><li> Played both ways in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldOfTheFiveGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldOfTheFiveGods">World of the Five Gods</a></em> series:
<ul><li> In <em>Paladin of Souls</em>, Ista explicitly tells Foix not to use his sorcery to enhance his seduction of Liss, saying it would be kinder to break both her legs with a warhammer.
</li><li> In <em>Penric and the Shaman</em>, an incident where a shaman attempted to use the weirding voice to seduce Desdemona's previous host is described. She's immune due to being a sorcerer, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">the seduction succeeds anyway</a>.

Once you smell them, there'll be an intense desire to have sex with them. While this isn't portrayed as <em>good</em> when Xizor's trying to coerce Leia into having sex with him this way, it's also not described as rape, nor are all his many previous "conquests". Basically, he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialRapist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialRapist">serial rapist</a>, which adds an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">extra layer of evil</a> to his character. He has also "made use" of Guri's anatomical correctness, at one point pondering if he should tell her to join him in his bath. As she is a droid and owned by him, it can lead a reader to wonder just how consensual this is. The sequel comic book <em>Shadows Of The Empire: Evolution</em> says she literally cannot disobey any of his orders, so the answer it gives would be "not at all". Apparently for Xizor Guri's his occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexbot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexbot">sexbot</a>.

When the crew comes to, they realize that Josef has raped Modra, ripping her clothes to shreds and leaving her with injuries. Alarmingly, this incident leads to a drastic shift in Modra's personality (from hardened fighter to promiscuous flirt), and the book then doubles down on the trope by having two characters remind Modra that she cannot be upset with Joself, as he had no control over his actions.

After they argue a bit about who's in charge, she simply takes over after he falls asleep, takes his body for a run, then showers and sleeps naked. Later she wrests control from him to force him to kiss his girlfriend (which he'd been too shy to do), and then to kiss Dr. Beckett against the man's will.

Typically the technology is only used if both parties are volunteers, but never is there a mention of anyone signing off on their swap partners exposing them to potential STDs, unanticipated pregnancy/paternity, or the knowledge that your body spent the night with Dr. Rush—all of which are frightening possible implications of the laissez-faire attitude the characters take to this technology.

The story doesn't treat him as an attempted rapist at all. Especially strange since the series at the time those events were occurring treated Barnabas as a very bad individual.

Yet the brothers show no concern or alarm over the matter aside from high-fiving Cas for losing his virginity. This matter is worsened in where Dean and Cas discuss how "hot" April was, disregarding the fact that she was raped, had stabbed Cas, and was murdered by the brothers.

After developing his psychic powers further, he also laughs over using his powers to beam non-stop gay porn into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>'s mind to torment him, with the other characters looking appropriately unsettled by this description of near-literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>.

This example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape">Date Rape</a> is not overtly punished (other than by having to hand in the drug) and never commented on again in the show.

</li><li> The creators apparently still didn't get the message, since a later episode, "Adam", centred around a mysterious new member of the team who eventually turned out to be an alien who survived by placing himself in people's memories. Not only do all the team believe he's been there all along, but Tosh believes they are in a relationship and, as a result, is a lot more happy and confident. The episode ends with everyone being made to forget him and it's played as though Tosh is losing something special as a result...but the fact that he was sleeping with her as a result of her false memories left some viewers uncomfortable.

<ul><li> Implied but possibly averted in Jack's story in the episode "The Doctor Dances" about waking up in bed with the jailers who were supposed to execute him after he got blindingly drunk as part of his Last Meal. It's a bit iffy, even if he seems to view it as a pleasant memory. His description strongly implies that they helped him escape after he propositioned them but before they had sex, but it isn't clear if the decision to seduce them happened before or after he got drunk. His statement that they're a "nice couple" who "still keep in touch" tends to imply that all parties have fond memories of the encounter.
</li><li> In "The Doctor's Daughter", the Doctor's distress over having his genetic code nonconsensually stolen to produce an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">Opposite-Sex Clone</a> who calls him "Dad" is put down by Donna to being "Dad Shock". The story seems to agree with her and think the Doctor should be more comfortable with the idea of being forced to father a child.

</li><li> Alternate Olivia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em> having sex for several weeks with Peter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">rape by fraud</a>. No one is really okay with this except Walternate though, so it's more of a subversion. Olivia apologizes to Peter for not thinking about how it affected him, and Broyles is reluctant to let Peter and Olivia read Fauxlivia's files because of "what they've been through". But initially, everyone acts like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">it's Olivia who's been primarily harmed in this situation</a>, not Peter. Instead of worrying about his son's well-being, Walter immediately pressures Peter to tell Olivia what happened - as if Peter made a knowing mistake he should confess. (Imagine making a real world rape victim talk about their ordeal with no regard to his/her own feelings.) And Olivia's complaints and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming">accusations</a> even push Peter to apologize to her for what happened to him. Also, it's never called "rape", and Fauxlivia is forgiven quite easily once they have to work together (considering that seducing Peter under false pretenses was not strictly speaking necessary for her mission).

When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chief Tyrel and Hilo</span> discover that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sharon Agathon</span> is about to be similarly assaulted, they interrupt her would-be rapists just as they are initiating the attack, killing one of them. This leads to serious arguments between characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonhuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonhuman">on the morality (or even possibility)</a> of raping a "machine".
<ul><li> However, the movie <em>Razor</em> makes it clear that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Admiral Cain</span>, who ordered the rapes as a means of interrogation in the first place, not only believed that the victim was capable of suffering like a human, but was counting on it: she expressly chooses the dehumanizing assaults because she hopes the victim will be susceptible to the same kinds of psychological pressures as a human and can be broken in this way, becoming a source of intelligence. However, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cain</span> is the very definition of a morally ambiguous and dangerously ruthless leader, and would probably have been perfectly capable of giving this order regardless, it is implied that it was also a form of cruel vengeance, because not only had the cylon attempted to destroy her ship during the genocidal attack on the Twelve Colonies, she had also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seduced and become Cain's lover in order to do so</span>.
</li><li> Doubly subverted in that this event converts a number of characters who have been on the fence regarding recognizing cylon humanity into true believers.

While Damon often has consensual sex, he's also shown mind-whammying girls (especially Caroline) into it, drinking their blood, and then making them forget it. Including a group of college girls, in a scene meant to highlight his own angst. In the second season he starts "dating" Andie, heavily and repeatedly compelling her and feeding on her. One time she goes off-script when he's in a bad mood he attacks and threatens her, so even if you ignore all the supernatural aspects he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuser</a>. No one appears to care about all this in the slightest. And when she dies, the show has the audacity to play it as a source of angst for him, despite her obviously being every bit as much his own victim as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stefan's</span>. This guy is one third of the show's main love triangle.

One episode deals with a nanotech drug that allows a person to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexByProxy">"ride" someone else's experiences</a>. As the person introduced to the drug was a man about to have sex with his girlfriend, the girlfriend later brings charges of rape against the third partner, as she certainly didn't consent to <em>him</em> getting involved.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em>, Tommy becomes a "Skin Walker" (shape-shifter that can turn into other people) early in season 5. He uses this power to impersonate Sam and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">have sex with his girlfriend</a>. This is treated pretty seriously... for about an episode. No one ever mentions the word "rape" and all is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">forgiven</a> shortly afterwards.

<ul><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">"Freaky Friday" Flip</a> episode, it's to be expected that characters will effectively see each others' bodies when they change clothes. Both Aeryn and John, who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> (they later became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>) and have swapped minds, take advantage of the situation to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManIFeelLikeAWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManIFeelLikeAWoman">explore their new bodies</a>, and while both are disgusted at each other the R word never raises its head.
</li><li> This is subverted when Grayza uses her pheromones to seduce and take advantage of Crichton. It is played VERY seriously and contributes heavily to her villain status. John actually refers to it as rape (though obliquely) during Grayza's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> later in the season.
</li><li> In <em>another</em> episode where the crew have their minds being screwed with, Crichton is the perpetrator this time, trying to force himself on Chiana. This was a "repercussion" of her being a huge tease and a floozy; or at least that was the justification at the time. Once everyone was back to normal, John was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">absolutely disgusted with himself</a>, although <em>Chiana</em> was the one to comfort him and tell him that it wasn't some "inner demon" but the fact that people were literally not thinking like themselves. How much of it was her convincing herself of that was unsaid, but a heavy implication.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em> deals heavily with this trope, as the shows premise deals with brainwashed women and men called "dolls" who can be implanted with customized personalities and skill sets and are often used as sex companions for clients. Episode 6 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hangs a lampshade</a> on the issue with two storylines: one about a handler/bodyguard revealed to be raping his doll in her "blank slate mode and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">asking if it's any different from</a> when a doll is on assignment and their personality thinks they're in love with the client. The other storyline depicts a sympathetic client, a grieving widower who uses the doll to recreate a touching romantic moment with his late wife but who is still considered evil for sleeping with the doll. The dolls are all volunteers who knew what they were signing up for, but it's still rape in the sense that a programmed personality doesn't realize their feelings and desires for their partner are all manufactured.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruction</a> gets even stickier when another regular client who sleeps with a male doll is revealed to be one of the female higher-ups running the Dollhouse, but "breaks up" with the doll because she feels so guilty about it.
</li><li> Then theres the subplot with Topher and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Claire Saunders</span>when she discovers shes really a doll implanted with her predecessors memories, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Claire</span> confronts Topher with the accusation that he designed her to want to sleep with him even though she hates him. He denies this and rejects her advances, however.
</li><li> Its also implied that at least one of them did <em>not</em> sign up willingly.
</li><li> This is also averted in that it's treated as one of the things that makes the Dollhouse a criminal organization that should be shut down.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alphas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alphas">Alphas</a></em>-when Nina "pushes" her ex-boyfriend into leaving his wife, it's depicted as a despicable act, and when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">forces Rachel to kiss her, even though she knows that it's going to overwhelm Rachel</span>, she's not forgiven for several episodes.
</li><li> Thoroughly averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> episode "Hathor", where the Goa'uld Queen Hathor rapes a brainwashed Daniel in order to get DNA to prevent immune rejection of her offspring. After everything's sorted out everyone, including Daniel, is visibly disgusted. So were the writers, who considered "Hathor" the worst episode in the series: in later episodes the characters refuse to talk about the episode's events, and that aspect of Goa'uld reproduction was quietly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> away. Likewise, several months prior to "Secrets" Apophis impregnates the host of his queen Amaunet, which happens to be Daniel's wife Sha're who was kidnapped in the pilot. Kudos to Daniel for being horrified at what was done to her but completely unwilling to reject her.

So he overpowers Ron Sandoval (a human altered by the Taelons), takes his form and overpowers Sibohan Beckett, another Taelon-altered human. Liam is conceived from the incident, but Sandoval remembers nothing of it, and Beckett had her memory wiped shortly after Liam's birth in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Resistance headquarters</a>. <em>Liam</em> is fully aware he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a>, though, and won't acknowledge his Kimera heritage any more than absolutely necessary.
<ul><li> Unfortunately played straight in the form of Lili being captured by the Jaridians, and having an affair with one disguised as a human soldier. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> is implied to be a factor.
</li><li> It also featured in an earlier episode where William Boone sleeps with a woman who he believes is an ex-lover but is actually a complete stranger: He has been implanted with false memories of their relationship as part of a Taelon test, and she often seduces men in this manner to test their loyalty. Boone does feel used when he realises the truth, although he seems more concerned about the fact that the false memories caused him to kill a man who was threatening her.

The indignation of the other characters seems to stem from Eva coercing Killian's love and taking him from Freya, with no mention of forced sex.
<ul><li> Ingrid's trance state with the mandragora. This results in horror and a mini-breakdown for Ingrid, but the rest of the cast utter 'oh noes' more akin to 'what a shame' than as if she had suffered a terrible ordeal.

One woman he got while looking like Luke Skywalker, while the other four women were seduced while he was wearing the faces of their husbands. Although he eventually goes away on rape charges, the episode's still a fair bit more comedic than most stories focusing on a serial rapist.

One is a superspy named Edward Albright, the the other a mild-mannered family man working a 9-to-5 office job named Henry Spivey. After the chip that regulates which personality is currently active starts to malfunction, Henry discovers Edward's existence and job. He then visits Edward's apartment and takes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Cool Car</a> for a ride. When Edward "wakes up" and finds out what Henry has been up to, he goes to Henry's home and has sex with his wife, leaving Henry a message on his hand not to touch his stuff. Henry looks more incredulous than upset, despite the fact that it's technically rape. Then again, Edward is the original owner of the body, and Henry is the identity created as a cover. However, Henry's family is real, and his wife knows nothing about Edward. She is pleasantly surprised, however, about "Henry" being a much better lover of late. This, apparently, happens plenty of times, and Henry stops caring that his wife is, essentially, sleeping with another man. On another occasion Henry also "woke" while Edward was having sex with his psychiatrist.

Though he brings it up when the truth comes out, it's never treated as an unforgivable deception and the word "rape" is avoided entirely. On the other hand, he was lying to Beth about who he was making him guilty of rape by fraud as well, and it's later indicated he knew Sarah wasn't really Beth.

<ul><li> After Lucifer's mother escapes hell and takes possession of the body of a recently killed woman named Charlotte Richards, Lucifer goes back to his decision to bring her back to hell and instead forces her to take the life of her host. When "Charlotte" mentions having sex with the clueless husband whenever he asks a question, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> and no one see anything wrong with that.
</li><li> Lucifer has the power to bring out people's "innermost desires", which includes making anyone who finds him remotely attractive be willing to have sex with him. While it's vague how much control he has over this, he is still fully aware of his effect on people and the person's ability to consent is extremely dubious, as the effects are uncomfortably similar to losing one's inhibitions due to drugs or alcohol.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville">The Orville</a></em>: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOrvilleS1E09CupidsDagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOrvilleS1E09CupidsDagger">Cupid's Dagger</a>" in a nutshell. Both Kelly and Ed have sex with Darulio while influenced by his pheromones to feel attraction toward him. This isn't something he can control, granted, but he could have worn gloves while aboard ship, or at the very least explained up-front about the pheromones before letting anyone touch him. It's also stated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesAnything">his culture considers it rude to reject an offer of sex</a>, so it's fair to say they don't have the same consideration of consent. Nobody calls it rape, or even wrong, after finding out though. The same also goes for Dr. Finn's willingness to have intimate relations with Yaphit when he inadvertently absorbs Darulio's pheromones, though Yaphit was ignorant of the situation and refused further offers after he found out. Though there isn't physical sex involved, Ed and Kelly both knew exactly what effect the pheromones would have when they dosed the diplomats with them to defuse a battle and avert a war. It isn't clear whether they tell their superiors about it, but no one who knows they did it calls them out for drugging the ambassadors. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The closest the episode gets to acknowledging the problem is when Kelly asks Darulio if he was similarly "in heat" when they slept together in the pilot (which incited her and Ed's divorce).</span>

<ul><li> This is handled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">inconsistently</a>. In one case, Lenny in Season 2, exists as a disembodied mind trapped inside The Shadow King's own disembodied mind. She clearly states that whilst a prisoner there she is being repeatedly raped by The Shadow King. In another case, we learn something troubling about Syd, in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she used her body swapping powers to take over the body of her own (sleeping) mother, seduce her mother's boyfriend, and initiate sex with him. When the powers swap her back into her own body, said boyfriend is terrified to discover he is mid-coitus with an underage girl. People don't know about her powers so Syd not only gets away with it, but her victim is arrested for committing statutory rape. Whilst the scenario isn't at all presented in a positive light, Syd shows no apparent remorse and no one ever confronts her about what she has done. On the contrary, David reacts like Syd was the victim when he sees what happened in her memory.</span>
</li><li> And in the end of season 2, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> David uses his powers to make Syd forget their arguments and then has sex with her (i.e. doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">exactly the same thing as in the Willow/Tara example above</a>)</span>, she has the nerve to not only (rightly) accuse him of raping her, but to also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> free the finally captured Shadow King in order to imprison David, and then to demand that David either be drugged to suppress his powers (and sanity) or stay forever imprisoned.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Travelers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Travelers">Travelers</a></em> it's an integral part of the "good guys" mission to maintain their cover by staying in the relationships their hosts had and pretending to be them under all circumstances. In fact, that's one of the basic laws they have to obey. Unusually for this trope, the main characters mostly do try to avoid the routine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">Bed Trick</a> this requires of them, but one of them does eventually have sex with "his" wife (he was drugged the first time) and then slowly falls in love with the woman - who still thinks he's her real husband, whose body the Traveler took over shortly before the guy's historical death. But even though the main characters are all presented as very ethical and well-intentioned people, and the Director who gave them their laws as god-like and better than people in terms of ethical restraints, nobody on the show has yet pointed out that this standard operating procedure means that thousands of Travelers are out there committing rape by fraud on their hosts' spouses and partners.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, giving Angela in Rivet City some ant queen pheromones so she can seduce her celibate love interest Diego (with the end result of him getting shotgun-married and kicked out of the priesthood he aspired to) nets you positive karma, meaning it's a good act. Conversely, bringing a crate of the rare Nuka-Cola Quantum to Ronald in Girdershade, so he can impress his neighbour Sierra (who is clearly hooked on the stuff) and entice her into sleeping with him, gives you negative karma. Evidently the latter is treated as bad, bad rape despite the fact that he's not trying to coerce her (he's just trying to impress her enough to want to go along with it voluntarily, and it fails completely because she doesn't understand what he wants and he's not spelling it out for her).
<ul><li> The Rivet City case is especially jarring because Diego's firm wish is to be a priest. Convincing a priest to abandon his faith by giving a woman a chemical which makes him unable to act rationally is a good act according to the devs.

The artist said he's iffy about rape jokes involving realistic situations, but since nobody in real life has ever actually had their life ruined by tentacles, he feels okay joking about it. It helps that the tentacle monsters have human-level intelligence and understand things like consent, so nobody in the comic actually does get raped, outside of fantasy sequences. Also, in at least one comic, it's the woman who is trying to bully the tentacle monster into a sexual encounter.
