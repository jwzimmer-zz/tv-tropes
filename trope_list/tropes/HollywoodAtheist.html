<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Atheists in real life are a rather diverse group. After all, the only thing confirmed by the label "atheist" is that the person doesn't believe in God/gods. It's like trying to make a coherent generalization about people who don't like baseball.
</p><p>
</p><p>In fiction, however (and <em>especially</em> in American fiction, as the title says), while it is reasonably common to see a character who is never shown practicing or even mentioning religion, it's generally only characters with a fair degree of cynicism and bitterness who will state outright that they are an atheist. Some of the more common character traits are:
</p><p></p><ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst">Cynicism Catalyst</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith">some other trauma</a>, or a miserable life in general was the direct cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilStoleMyFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilStoleMyFaith">their 'conversion' to atheism</a>, as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">Rage Against the Heavens</a> at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> who lets such things happen. Consequently, the Hollywood Atheist can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism">easily be made</a> to reverse or reexamine their lack-of-belief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsAGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsAGod">if something good happens</a>, even if there is no explicit connection between the good event and divine intervention. Conversely, when something bad happens (especially their own death approaching) the atheist will suddenly become enough of a believer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrayerIsALastResort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrayerIsALastResort">pray for help</a>. This is where you get the old (and disproved) saying "There are no atheists in foxholes." See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay-Theist</a> if they do believe in a higher power but have a grudge against it for these reasons; the character falls in this trope if they profess a disbelief in the relevant deity despite their actions/views seemingly being fuelled by an intense hatred of it.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Atheists have been turned off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">hypocrites and villains acting in the name of religion</a> and only need to be shown a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaintlyChurch">non-hypocritical or heroic</a> believer to see the light.
</li><li> Atheists show contempt, dislike, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">hatred towards religion and gods</a> (which may become contradictory to the point of them seeming to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay Theists</a> instead), and will mock believers to no end.
</li><li> Sometimes in relation to any of the previous points, atheists are depressed, lonely, anti-social, and often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilists</a>, underlining the idea that atheism is simply not compatible with happiness.
</li><li> Atheists are somehow simply ignorant or unaware of religion, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism">will happily convert on the spot</a> when informed of the rudiments of whatever dogma the work is endorsing. Expect them in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a>. (Despite the trope name, this shows up as early as the book <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayy_ibn_Yaqdhan">Hayy ibn Yaqzan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, making this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>.)
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Atheists only seem to have arguments against their culture's predominant religion. In the real world this is most often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Christianity</a>, and to a lesser extent, its brethren <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Judaism</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>. They'll have nothing to say about other spiritualities  they may even view them positively in contrast. (Note, however, that some Eastern religions like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and Jainism have sects which actually enforce atheism or are at least compatible with it  they might not feature belief in god(s), only in other elements of their cosmology like reincarnation and karma.)
</li><li> Atheists are hardline materialists and/or have a pseudo-religious belief in science and logic (which is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism">scientism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, not atheism). They might even be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">technophiles</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhumanism">transhumanists</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstChurchOfMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstChurchOfMecha">roboticists</a> as well, effectively having that as their religion.
</li><li> Atheists are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">selfish</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist">hedonists</a> who only care about themselves and their own happiness. Going to the extreme of this idea, they might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">consider and/or proclaim themselves God(s)</a> under the right conditions, often fully meaning it rather than doing it to invoke blasphemy.
</li><li> Atheists are straight-out evil, whose lack of belief enables them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpOffTheSlipperySlope">Jump Off The Slippery Slope</a> with glee, underlining the idea that a person can't be an atheist <em>and</em> moral at the same time. In addition to lacking religion, they also lack any kind of empathy for others. Bonus points are awarded if they believe that rejecting religion makes them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">exempt from the concept of good and evil</a> (which only ever seems to make someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">a villain</a>). Compare and contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn">FaithHeel Turn</a>.
</li><li> Atheists are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions">smugly convinced of their own intellectual superiority</a> and usually blinded to the "truth" by their own elitist pretensions. Usually, they are shown as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from their religious opponents, especially the more fanatical ones.
</li><li> Related to the previous, atheists might consider themselves modern or hip for it, with their beliefs being portrayed as a fad they will ultimately outgrow.
</li><li> Atheists don't just argue against theism, but may actively discriminate against, harass, and even persecute believers.
</li><li> In older works, they may be stereotyped as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BombThrowingAnarchists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BombThrowingAnarchists">Bomb-Throwing Anarchists</a> and or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommies">Dirty Commies</a>, given the prevalence of atheism among such ideologues. An association with communism (usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssociationFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssociationFallacy">citing the crimes</a> of the USSR, etc.) is still used to disparage atheism at times, even when the specific atheists are not at all communist (or when churches were complicit in the crimes of these regimes as well).
</li><li> Atheists may be portrayed as or assumed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">evilutionary biologists</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Social Darwinists</a> if they advocate the theory of evolution or work in the life sciences, despite such ideas being much older than evolution or modern atheism, having advocates from a variety of religious orientations and being actively disavowed by most today.
</li></ul><p>Common to all portrayals of the Hollywood Atheist is the idea that faith is the natural state and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith">something must occur to drive the character away</a> from the norm. Given that the majority of humans worldwide are religious (to varying degrees), this understandably colors media greatly, but still, it's always 'my reason for not believing is X.' One never hears 'I just don't have a reason to believe', which is a common (if not the most common) real-life reason given by atheists. The "Problem of Evil" (why would a good God create evil or suffering?) is an age-old question that has perplexed scholars of religion precisely because <em>scholars of religion want to believe.</em> For an atheist who doesn't have reason to believe, the "Problem of Evil" isn't very relevant. However, other atheists will use this as an argument against belief in God.
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableReligiousTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableReligiousTargets">Acceptable Religious Targets</a>. A major exception is science fiction, which often goes so far the other way as to state that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsWrong">Religion Is Wrong</a> and humanity has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions">Outgrown Such Silly Superstitions</a>. For atheists living in fantasy settings where the existence of gods is irrefutable, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a> (who stubbornly disbelieves in the factuality of God/gods) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay-Theist</a> (who accepts the factuality of God/gods, but refuses to worship Him/them).
</p><p>As with other strawman tropes, Hollywood Atheism is a caricature of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> attitudes crafted to suit the purposes of various authors; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease">by definition, real atheists are not examples</a>. The fact that there unfortunately <em>are</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a> of atheists in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> who exhibit these characteristics does <em>not</em> mean that you should assume that those characteristics apply to any atheist you meet.
</p><p>Compare with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Holier Than Thou</a>, and see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith">Crisis of Faith</a>. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atheism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atheism">Useful Notes on Atheism</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant">Not to be confused with</a> some of the American conservative movement's more vocal members' view of Hollywood's "war on Faith".

<ul><li> Edward Elric, a bitter young man who lost his faith in any kind of benevolent god when an attempt to resurrect his dead mother goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">horribly awry</a> and becomes very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">grouchy and condescending</a> when it comes to religion. However, he often seems more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay-Theist</a>, considering that "God" or the closest thing to that is the Truth, who was the one who took Ed's arm and leg along with Al's body. In the first chapter of the manga, Ed mutters that he's agnostic when Rose goes on about the local priest's miracles. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a>, Edward is depicted as an agnostic theist instead of an atheist. While he still openly questions the existence of a God, several lines make it clear that he believes in one even if he's against worshiping it.
</li><li> There's also a later chapter on the Ishvalan war, in which the religious leader of the country turns himself in to save his people. King Bradley declares that his life is not worth an entire nation and laughs that if their god exists, why doesn't He strike him down for the genocide. Shortly after, Mustang and Hughes discuss Ishval's religion and how their god seems to have abandoned them.

In Revy's case it was replaced with a nihilistic materialism (in her own words: "Money and guns. As long as you have those, the world's a great place."), while Hansel and Gretel were driven utterly insane by the injustices done to them and became convinced the only purpose behind existence is to kill or be killed. The only exception to this rule is the arc villain Takenaka, who is an atheist but doesn't have any kind of sob story to go with it.

His nonbelief later drove him to start his own evil cult.

They kidnapped <em>him</em>, where he was kept literally in a cage with other children his age, is implied to have been gang-raped on a near-nightly basis, and then ultimately denounced his faith during a ceremony in which he was to be the sacrifice.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> is portrayed as an atheist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">by some writers</a>, presumably as a side effect of having his parents killed and spending the last 10 to 15 years looking at the slimy underside of society.
<ul><li> Given that Batman has seen demons, been teammates with angels, and in general encountered mystical things enough to know that <em>some</em> kind of supreme being exists, Batman's position is sometimes written not as "There is no God" but "When I finally meet God, He'd better have a <em>really</em> good explanation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">all this crap.</a>"
</li><li> After much scrutiny, the folks at the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/comic_book_religion.html#heroes">Adherents<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> website have concluded that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Batman.html">Batman is a lapsed Episcopalian or Catholic.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Neil Gaiman gives him a suitable atheistic afterlife: he gets to reincarnate as himself, in a different Earth, every time.
</li><li> At least in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeofComicBooks">the Bronze Age</a>, he is definitely not a religious practitioner. When asked by Dr. Leslie Thompkins if he ever prayed, he replied "No. Not since <em>that night</em>."
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>, Batman only believes in gods he has evidence for. For example, he is obviously not stupid enough to deny all the angels, gods, demons, zombies etc. he's seen are real. However, he's quick to point out that he doesn't believe in most <em>claims</em> of them, because he's experienced enough to know the real gods and angels and demons and suchlike from the fakes. Batman certainly doesn't worship God or practice religion, at least from what is seen in the show.
</li><li> Technically, Batman has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">already killed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">ONE god</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Tim Drake (Red Robin/Robin III) in the Pre-Flashpoint continuity (1989-2011) was officially made to not "get" faith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin">Red Robin</a></em> #22 (which would make him a regular atheist) but afterwards he also says he has trouble believing a God would let all these horrors happen while saving a Church member.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet">Freddy Krueger</a>-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">Mister Rictus</a> from the comic book miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wanted">Wanted</a></em>. He was the most pious of Christians until he died on the operating table after an accident. After seeing what lay beyond, i.e. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath">nothing</a></em>, he went completely crazy and started doing whatever the hell he felt like with no restrictions or morality whatsoever. Of course the fact that the accident scarred him to a ridiculous degree may have contributed. He is basically the personification of one of the most common atheist reactions to the "Atheists have no moral code" claim-namely, "If faith is <strong>really</strong> the only thing that keeps someone moral, then that someone has problems."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis">Warren Ellis</a> has used a similar approach a couple of times. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Stormwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Stormwatch">Stormwatch</a></em>, there's a character called The Eidolon, who's died and returned to let everyone know that there's nothing beyond this life. Then there's an early issue of Planetary with a Hong Kong ghost cop (possibly cop ghost) who's come back with a similar message: "There's just us." "Did he say justice?" "No. 'Just us.'".
</li><li> The Kree from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> claim to have mathematically disproved the existence of God and teach it to kids just after toilet training. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a> in the Marvel Universe means they're crossed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a>: Michael Holt, aka Mister Terrific.

Developments with Mr. Terrific (especially meeting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">Earth-2 mk II counterpart</a>) have pretty much established that he was indifferently religious until his wife died, at which point he got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">pissed off at God</a>; had she survived, he would have found a profound faith from that miracle, so he's playing this trope straight now.
</li><li> Madcap in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a></em> comics doesn't believe in Zadkiel (the evil angel who took control of heaven) <em>even though he is directly working for him</em>. And note that this takes place in the Marvel universe, where, decades ago, the Gorgon mathematically proved the existence of God. That said, Madcap is one of the most tragic examples of this trope, a devoutly religious young man who saw his entire congregation die horribly in the accident that gave him superhuman powers. Needless to say, such incidents didn't exactly help his mental stability. However, it's also worth noting that the atheist facet of his personality was only introduced in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a></em> comics.

The fascistic Federation regards religion as potentially subversive. The heroine, Captain Lola Beck, reflects this view and cracks down hard on fellow soldier Holly Little's Christian prattle. She even questions the sanity of her superior, Sky Marshall Anoke, when he also claims to believe in God.

After a miraculous escape—but the children's safety isn't certain, not permanently—Alexander muses, "If there is a god, then he's a shit, and I'd like to kick him in the butt."

These include him mentioning to the Abbe that he "has been to Hell", during his fighting in the Napoleonic Wars, whereas the Abbe has "only read about it." Also: "Why should I love God? He strung up his son like a side of veal. I shudder to think what he'd do to me."
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRite">The Rite</a></em>, the main character is a priest who doesn't actually believe in God (he joined the seminary to get a free college degree). Even after he sees a girl possessed by demons who speaks in tongues, contorts her body into impossible positions, and her voice changes completely, along with her <em>vomiting up the nails used to crucify Jesus</em>, he still claims it was just a hoax to cover up her being molested.

</li><li> The Christian film <em>The Atheist</em> is about an atheist man taken on a trip by Jesus to examine the issue of faith. Apparently all atheists are rampant sinners who do just about everything a Christian would think of as wrong.
</li><li> In <em>Cargo 200</em>, Artyom, professor of scientific atheism, is both this and a straw Marxist philosopher. When he has a discussion with a believing peasant, who himself is a self-taught philosopher, he doesn't have anything to say except stupid cliches of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. As a human being, he is a despicable coward, who knows the truth of the murder and kidnapping the plot revolves around, but doesn't say anything, even knowing that an innocent man is going to be framed and executed for these crimes, because he doesn't want to be involved with the police. He doesn't change his mind even when the mother of the accused man begs him to testify.

<ul><li> Josh's aggressively atheist philosophy professor Radisson declares all his students must sign a statement that "God Is Dead", or fail his class. Josh won't do this, so Radisson informs him he must therefore argue the statement's antithesis.

Interestingly enough, the film seems to be trying for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">reconstruction</a> of this trope: Raddison himself tries to use the story of his mother to justify himself to Josh when the two of them are alone, by noting that "many of the greatest atheists were once Christians".

Randy is initially an atheist who defends his hedonistic swinger lifestyle by saying it's a biological imperative for humans to have sex.

However, she's also portrayed as completely sincere in her principles, genuinely believing that her cause is right, taking in a young gay man kicked out by his family and also valuing her family above all.

<ul><li> The film has a blatant example of this in its protagonist, who not only is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarOnStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarOnStraw">caricature</a> of famous atheists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherHitchens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherHitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a>, but he also openly admits that the reason for his atheism is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilStoleMyFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilStoleMyFaith">his youngest son died of cancer</a>.

Interestingly enough, the film seems to be trying for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">reconstruction</a> of this trope: Harkens <em>himself</em> tries to use the story of his son to justify himself, apparently trying to make a Problem of Evil argument (i.e. that suffering like this would not be allowed by an all-good, all-powerful God, thus one does not exist) though it's not very well explained. He also doesn't bother actually making this an argument in debate (although it's a common one, and what many Christians openly admit is difficult).
</li><li> It also falls on the well-worn Evangelical view of secularists only leading lives of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist">empty hedonism</a>, as pre-conversion Sol has no moral principles other than endless partying (that only makes him more miserable).

Why they worship Hitler raises suspicions because Hitler condemned atheism. There is NO evidence to suggest that the real-life Dylan and Eric were actually atheists, and the two scenes where they taunted Rachel for her religious faith (one in the stairway, the other after they shot her in non-fatal areas) were entirely fabricated for the film.

But after several people are killed in an avalanche on the 16th day, Fito's agnosticism is almost played for laughs when, upon hearing the sounds of another potential avalanche, he hurriedly starts praying the Hail Mary with the rest of the survivors.

Victor's lack of morals are also based after his own arrogance and belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">he is the pinnacle of human potential</a>.

<ul><li> The Misfit, from short story "A Good Man is Hard to Find," is practically the archetypal dangerous, nihilistic atheist. He decided at an early age that if Jesus never died on the cross, then there's no reason to do anything at all but enjoy himself the only way he knew how: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">killing</a>. The story may have been a reaction to the rise of existentialism in literature.
</li><li> <em>Good Country People</em> features the protagonist as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">a grumpy atheist, who mainly does it solely to annoy people</a>, attempting to "convert" (read: seduce, then crush his beliefs) a seemingly wholesome Southern boy who's got the fire of Jesus in him, selling Bibles for a living.

Like the protagonist's fake leg.
</li><li> Another one of her stories, "The Lame Shall Enter First" features a more positive, humanistic atheist faced with a cloven-footed character who claims to be a Satanist. The Satanist comes across as the wiser of the two: at least he knows how the battle lines are drawn.
</li><li> Another (kind of) positive portrayal of an atheist (sort of) is the title character from <em>Parker's Back</em>, although he's more agnostic - being vaguely spiritual but not believing in gods and basically treating tattoos as his religion. He's married to a shrewish hateful Christian woman who hates things that aren't Christian and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar">if she hates something it isn't Christian.</a> Also, she falls into heresy.

</li></ul></li><li> The novel <em>The Last Templar</em> features a character who vowed to destroy Christianity after taking the advice of a priest to not abort his wife's high risk pregnancy, resulting in his wife and unborn child's death. Just to <em>really</em> show he means business, he <em>sets fire to the church</em> with the priest still inside shortly afterwards.
</li><li> The one-act play "Deus X" plays around with this trope. It concerns a neuroscientist who wonders why he grew up to be an atheist while his brother grew up to be a televangelist. He eventually discovers that religious faith is caused by a gland in people's brains, and develops a drug that eliminates it. Although this turns the devout into wanton sex maniacs and the kind of conscienceless people that atheists are often stereotyped as, it is portrayed as unequivocally a good thing, and the play ends with the doctor character encouraging the audience to take a handful of the pills when they leave.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlesAndEmma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlesAndEmma">Charles and Emma: The Darwins' Leap of Faith</a></em> exists partly to explore this trope.
</li><li> Adam Hauptman of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a></em> series became an atheist after witnessing the horrors of the Vietnam War and simultaneously surviving a werewolf attack. He's bitter about his memories of dying in the jungle, waiting for God to save him and his comrades. Though it seems his bitterness is more towards his own naivete, he also mocks Mercy for her belief. Mercy herself is shocked that anyone could remain an atheist after witnessing the power of Christian symbols to repel vampires and other evil beings.
</li><li> In the Endworld novels, the Doktor is a prominent example. His devout atheism is due entirely to his parents being killed in a car crash before the war.
</li><li> The dwarfs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C.

Trumpkin, one of the "good" red dwarfs, helps the good guys in <em>Prince Caspian</em> but denies the existence of Aslan, even when Aslan is standing in front of him (which is how some Christians view atheists as behaving) until Aslan roars in his face. The "bad" black dwarfs in <em>The Last Battle</em>, meanwhile, reject Aslan and are doomed to wallow in their own mortality. Lewis's fiction for adults is actually a bit more subtle than that; there are quite a few examples of this type, but then there's at least one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> who remains a defiant atheist to the end.

In <em>Darkly Dreaming Dexter</em>, the novel on which the show is based, his brother Brian is also an atheist for the same reason, though it is also implied (at least in the Showtime series) that, rather than actively disbelieving in a god, Dexter simply has no <em>use</em> for religion/the concept of a god (this is sometimes called "apatheism"). In a later season he starts to explore the idea more after pursuing a serial killer whose inspiration is the Book of Revelation, becoming impressed by a reformed murderer-turned-minister called Brother Sam, but still never fully becomes religious that we see.

In fact, this is what got his family killed after he did a fake "reading" of a serial killer, so it explains his hostility to such beliefs. And when another psychic "successfully" guesses a few things and tells him about the murders, he breaks down defeated and crying. One of the few times he openly wavers on the issue is the episode that ends with Jane and his brother-in-law visiting Jane's wife's grave. His brother-in-law asks if he thinks she can see them (since she would be happy to have them reconciled).

More accurately, she believes that whether there's actually a God or not is immaterial, since humanity could never hope to understand him in any case. "I think penguins may as well speculate about quantum physics," as she puts it.

It was however later revealed that it was not religion that drove a wedge between him and his sister, but the fact that Cox didn't want to deal with anything from his childhood, and religion was just an excuse.

Interestingly, the Inquisitor's 'duty' is based on the notion that life is extremely precious, a common belief in many real atheists. This would make him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Hollywood Atheist</a>.

<ul><li> Played pretty straight with Morgan—he has a lot of pent up rage at religion due to God not rescuing him from his childhood trauma despite his prayers. However, while the character arc does end with him in church, this seems to be more a matter of making his peace with religion than actually becoming religious, as he still doesn't seem to believe in God. In terms of other characters, Rossi is Catholic, Hotch is an agnostic, Gideon has described himself as a man of (unspecified) faith, and Reid describes himself as a "man of science"—though he did have a near-death-experience, and has been rather confused on the matter since then. The show itself seems to be actively agnostic — not in the sense of ignoring the question, but in the sense of very deliberately bringing it up and very deliberately refusing to answer it.
</li><li> "The Popular Kids" presents the killer as a Nietzsche-quoting teenager who murdered jocks in fake Satanic rituals, blaming the deeply religious town. In particular, he framed a local "Satanic" (read, "atheistic, heavy-metal-listening, and bitter, but not really Satanic or a killer") youth. Reid tells him that, like a lot of people, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe">misinterpreted Nietzsche</a>.

An annoyed Strife appears and demonstrates his powers, but Pythagoras dismisses them as magic tricks. He explains to Hercules that the reason he doesn't believe is that his father devoted his life to the gods, to the point that he spent more time at the temples instead of with his family. None of his father's prayers were answered and Pythagoras never saw any evidence of the divine beings his father constantly preached about. At the end of the episode, Pythagoras reluctantly admits that there <em>may</em> be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw">beings that seem to be gods</a>.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>. After a bus driver apparently kills himself by driving his bus (full of kids) off a cliff, his last acts come under scrutiny. Specifically, when he stopped at a convenience store shortly before his end, he bought a number of things, including a cheap little Christian keychain, which he then shrugged at and tossed in the trash. Everyone assumed that this was a sign he was turning his back on God, and thus planned to kill himself. When Veronica investigates, she finds that the store has a large sign proclaiming "NO CHANGE (don't even ask!)." So he was just buying the cheapest thing he could to make change, and threw it away because it was a cheap little keychain that wasn't worth keeping. It is eventually discovered that he didn't actually kill himself; there was a bomb on the bus. Though in fairness, the fact that he left a note saying he was leaving his wife for another woman, but which was vague enough to be mistaken for a suicide note, <em>really</em> didn't help.

She reacts to Paige's joining a church youth group as if her daughter takes to drugs or prostitution. As a rule, while the average Soviets did frown upon religion, they wouldn't exactly freak out like Elizabeth either. Even Philip has to tell her to cool it a bit-she'd been shown to take stereotypical Soviet values far more seriously than him already.

Given this was in the Cold War era, it may have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> regarding the officially atheist communist states, who persecuted religious people... and everyone else who didn't obey them. They even claim that the State has <em>proven</em> that he doesnt exist. They dont say HOW they did that, but presumably few people are going to argue with them. Naturally, Wordsworth denies they can prove such a thing (at this point he's been sentenced to death anyway).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MastersOfHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MastersOfHorror">Masters of Horror</a></em> episode "Haeckel's" tale, the titular Haeckel, a medical student, doesn't believe in God, the soul, or the supernatural, and tries to reproduce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Dr. Frankenstein's</a> experiments. This is clearly linked to his materialist view of things, which is proven entirely, horribly wrong by the end. Oh, and he shares a name with the real biologist Ernst Haeckel, the 19th century German scientist who proposed racist scientific theories and was a materialist (though not an atheist, but a pantheist-he's often mistaken for the former).

</li><li> <em>Belle's</em>, a black family sitcom, has the main characters view an atheist this way. Daughter Jil brings a date home to have dinner with her family, who says he's an atheist during conversation. This is treated like the worst possible thing, explicitly more so even than being a criminal. Jack, her date, defends himself well, but to no avail. He's actually portrayed in a positive way himself-denying any of the stereotypical reasons for disbelief, and making some good points against their bias. It's Jil and her family who buy into the trope. While her dad later says he accepts it if Jil wants to still see Jack, he's overjoyed when she says they broke up.

Unusually, he doesn't seem to have had a single moment that embittered him, so much as years of dealing with his unhinged wife and children - one episode has flashbacks to Ben before Nick's birth, and he's almost unnervingly chipper and upbeat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGods">American Gods</a></em>: Laura, who didn't believe in God or an afterlife, and was depressed with her life despite having Shadow (whom she cheated on while he was in prison). After she dies, Anubis claims she "believed in nothing". This is because she actively <em>refused</em> to believe in anything, not love, not her husband, not anything. In contrast, Shadow is a more evenhanded atheist, who believes in plenty of things but is skeptical of the supernatural.

<ul><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">interesting</a> take on atheism in a world where most of the gods are flat-out <em>evil.</em> Or, well, they used to. There used to be more chaos gods, including Necoho who was the God of <em>Atheism</em>. This was in a world where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">Gods Need Prayer Badly</a>. So the more you prayed to him, the weaker he got, and the less you worshiped, the stronger he got. He would also try to destroy/wreck the other Chaos Gods' plans, and hoped to destroy all gods, including himself. This fell out of favor with the writers. He only actually appeared in the story once, in an RPG adventure; a few authors just enjoy name dropping him as an obscure call-back.
</li><li> The single group that would seem most like they would be atheists- but aren't- are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">Tech Priests.</a> They believe that the greatest show of their love is to cut off bits of their bodies and replace them with machinery. However, they do this because they worship a being they call the Machine God, or the Omnissiah (who is all but stated to be the C'tan Void Dragon, one of the eldest forms of life in <em>existence</em>, locked up on Mars by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a>).
</li><li> The Tau are atheists, but believe in something they call the Greater Good. They do believe in their own intellectual superiority, but they are also cut off from a realm of existence called the Warp, which is where and how the various gods of the 40K-verse work their power. Thus tales of possession and the horrors faced by psykers get nothing but disbelief from them, they refer to Chaos armies as madmen (which, while technically true, leaves out the very important fact that they're <em>divine-powered</em> madmen), and believe manifesting Daemons to be yet another form of alien resistant to the concept of the Greater Good. A Tau fleet pulled into a warp rift in one story was rescued by what is, by all appearances, a minor god embodying their Greater Good philosophy; they still have no idea what to make of it.
</li><li> In a twist of supreme irony, the man who would become the (literal) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> of Mankind was very much an atheist, as demonstrated in "The Last Church", where he argues with the last priest left on Earth about the merits of faith, using only examples like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">The Crusades</a> and other religious massacres to make his point. It was so poorly argued that the uneducated drunk of a priest <em>verbally destroyed him</em> and deconstructed his entire grand ambition; it's currently the page quote for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a>. One of his sons betrayed him precisely because his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a> worshiped him as a god, when he thought rational thought should replace faith. The Emperor was aware of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a> nature of his universe, and wanted to make everyone atheists in order to weaken the gods (which was doomed to fail since Gods in his setting don't feed on faith, but emotion, so unless everyone dies or becomes as emotionless as the Necrons, it won't work out). Oddly enough, faith in the Emperor happens to be a potent weapon against Chaos.

He's a doubter like Thomas of Aquin, hence his libertine ways and his love of breaking anything sacred out of spite (such as sleeping with nuns, offering indecent money to poor people if they will curse God, etc).

When Karl returns <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and orders his men to burn down the castle and capture Franz, Franz has a long talk with himself and then with a priest about the existence of God and about whether he will be punished for his sins.

<ul><li> Hayley in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> is an atheist just to tick off her ultra-conservative dad, though at one point when she was dying of cancer she made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven">deal with God</a> that if she got better she would save the orphans who were abused by Roger and Steve. The series also has an interesting example in the episode "Rodger Codger": first Hayley belittles Francine for teaching the catechism to some children, then after Roger's apparent death, a priest tells Francine that he won't go to heaven, since heaven is only for humans (it doesn't help that they told him Roger was a pet). Francine becomes extremely disillusioned, and pretty much becomes this trope, with the supposedly atheist Hayley trying to make Francine embrace her faith again, so Francine doesn't stay one for long.
<ul><li> Stan briefly becomes this trope when Steve convinces him that Christianity is nonsense (by nitpicking some extremely low-hanging fruit in the Bible such as the exact order of the steps of creation in Genesis, and Adam's age) and briefly becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist">The Hedonist</a> before sinking into a deep depression.

In the episode "Hurricane" he says that he doesn't believe in God, but doesn't consider himself an atheist, since he thinks that atheism is just another religious belief. This is forgotten in season three where he explicitly refers to himself as an atheist.
</li><li> Brian of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> has stated himself to be an atheist, though he subverts this trope for the most part. While certainly cynical and suffering periods of bitterness, overall he tends to be quite cheerful and relaxed about life. The only occasion where he wasn't willing to live and let live when it came to a Christian was when it was Meg, in an episode where she was driving everyone crazy with her newly acquired born-again Christian beliefs, and made Brian into a social pariah by telling everyone he was an atheist. Yet it was actually the book burning that really pushed Brian over the edge. Of course, the episode also ends with Brian convincing her that God cannot be real, or else he would not have made Meg as ugly as she is (granted, he was at the end of his rope).

</li><li> Brian is a rare portrayal of the fictional atheist in that he actually does outright state that his reason for not believing in God is that he's never seen any evidence. He even points out that we've sent all manner of probes and crafts up into space and have never once found anything resembling a divine entity. Despite this, God and Jesus Christ are both semi-regular characters on the show, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Brian has personally met the latter</a>.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, he wasn't an atheist in the earlier seasons. In fact, when Peter claims that he's a god and causes plagues to reign down on his family, Brian points out the exact reason to him:

The church then gets picketed by agnostics who protest for their right to believe in something that may or may not exist.

His wife and son are very religious, but his atheism stems from the fact that his wife, who he used to have a happy marriage with, prayed during the pregnancy of her only surviving child (and didn't smoke, or drink, or go on any roller coasters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">or horseback riding</a>), believes God is the reason her son survived and now favors Clay over him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Clay's behavior after his wife dies contributes to his atheism as well</span>.

Despite this, he's met and thwarted the Devil, respects Christmas as a tradition, and has been shown to not be above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrayerIsALastResort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrayerIsALastResort">prayer as a last resort</a> (and then immediately blowing it off when things go his way).

After Ned Flanders becomes principal of Springfield Elementary, the school falls into a state of chaos and anarchy due to him being a pushover. This doesn't bother Chalmers at all (he openly states that he punished Skinner for less serious issues mainly because he didnt like Skinner) but what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">puts him over the edge</a> is Ned Flanders saying "Let's thank the Lord for another beautiful school day!" over the PA system.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Chalmers</strong>: Thank the Lor — thank the Lord? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer. A prayer in a public school! God has no place within these walls, just like facts have no place within organized religion!

It's just that BECAUSE he's seen so many strange and outlandish adventures that he considers it more likely that anything the can't explain is just another super power they haven't heard of yet as opposed to something caused by an actual God. Being able to rain down lightning on a whim doesn't look as divine after your crew has already spent time fighting a living sand storm and riding geysers into the sky. Furthermore, he also stated that if God did exist, he would like to meet him because he or she would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>.

This causes him to have a small argument with Twilight, who believes entirely in her own god, Queen Faust, over how it is possible to not believe in gods and how you can be sure that everyone in your world believes the same as you. Sunset eventually calms them both down and explains to them that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureVsNurture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureVsNurture">instinct that ponies have that has them believe in Queen Faust isn't shared by humans.</a> Flash for his part says that he is more of an agnostic these days due to all of the magical events he has witnessed first-hand and is more willing to believe in things than he was previously.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">     Film </div><div class="folder" id="folder19" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz">Hot Fuzz</a></em> with protagonist Nicholas Angel, who says he's open to religion, though not entirely convinced in a brief conversation with the town vicar (leading the vicar to label him agnostic instead), and is the most morally upright person shown, to the point of following <em>every</em> rule to the letter. While the guy <em>does</em> have some issues (namely being a killjoy), he's never anything less than a hero.
</li><li> Averted with the hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaHasRisenFromTheGrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaHasRisenFromTheGrave">Dracula Has Risen from the Grave</a></em>, who just happens to be an atheist, with no tragic past. He eventually converts by the end because he sees Dracula getting repelled by a cross and it gives him reason to believe in God.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord">John Ford</a>, despite being a Catholic himself, provided an aversion in his final film, <em>7 Women</em>, where Anne Bancroft, an atheist doctor working in a religious mission, ends up performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.

In the film, while her character's atheism is implied and stated, she is fairly good-natured (if an alcoholic) about it and doesn't seem to have trauma. John Ford explained her simply:

</li><li> The filmmakers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLedge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLedge">The Ledge</a></em> deliberately wanted to avert this trope for the protagonist, who is an openly atheist man that didn't come to his lack of belief due to trauma, leads a fairly happy life and doesn't convert in the end. Unfortunately, the hero becomes unsympathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">for other reasons</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoloist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoloist">The Soloist</a></em>: Steve seems to have this view of them. Early on in the film, he attempts interviewing an atheist charity group, and one of his lines is So do you non-gather in your non-worship? The film itself doesn't agree with him on that issue however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spartacus">Spartacus</a></em>: Gracchus states that privately he believes in none of the gods, but realistically when in public of course he believes in all of them. He is not portrayed as worse for this, and in fact comes off better than most of the politicians by the end.

As an atheist, Lee Strobel is depicted as a likeable and sympathetic character. Also, the supporting characters who are atheists or agnostics are mostly decent, realistic people. Lee's atheist mentor even warns him against pursuing his quest to disprove Christianity, saying that it might ruin Lee's marriage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chocolat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chocolat">Chocolat</a></em>: Vianne to the villagers (given that she practices various traditional magics and is going to hold a fertility celebration on Easter, while Vianne is labeled an atheist she probably practices pagan-in a broad sense of the word-beliefs, though she would never label herself as such). To them, any person who just isn't a Catholic seems to qualify. Averted though as she never actually displays any of the traits (nor expresses what her beliefs are, besides them being clearly at odds with theirs).
<div class="indent"><strong>Boy 1</strong>: I hear she's an atheist.

Though he is firmly anti-religious, he treats the believers cordially and even views Pastor Dan as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">worthy opponent</a> in light of their debate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMatterOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMatterOfFaith">A Matter of Faith</a></em>: Surprisingly subverted with Kamen, given that he's set up as the designated villain of the film. He's unfailingly friendly, patient and polite with others, showing none of the stereotypical traits. The nearest he comes is bruskly saying Stephen should "Wake up" and realize that there's no God or afterlife during their debate. Earlier he sincerely stated he's got no problem with Stephen's faith though, so this may have just been a bit of exasperation in their exchange, which had gotten heated. Despite the fear Stephen has, he never tries to convince Rachel and the rest of his students that his views are right as a result of the fact evolution occurred.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note50srv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note50srv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note50srv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The film does not even mention theistic evolution.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ICantThinkStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ICantThinkStraight">I Can't Think Straight</a></em>: Averted with Tala, who may not believe in God (she's unclear) but is a nice person. It appears that her main beef, regardless of what she believes herself, is the negative aspects of organized religion.

William doesn't believe that there's anything more to a person's mind than just all the neurochemistry which makes up their brains, rejecting any soul. His wife Mona is dismayed by this materialist view, trying to dissuade him from it. Yet he is never anything less than a good man. It also turns out he's <em>right</em>, as he later manages to successfully revive both her and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most of</span> their children through copying their minds into some cloned bodies, which isn't portrayed as bad.

Miranda teases Cyd a little by calling her "Ms. Atheist" and does appear to have mildly negative opinions on atheism/religious skepticism, but suggests this may be just coming to things from a different though compatible angle to religious perspectives. For her part, Cyd suffered a terrible tragedy in her past but this doesn't appear to be why she's an atheist-she just wasn't raised religious. In any case she's portrayed as nice and upbeat, aside from very mild rudeness.

Jasnah is always respectful of Shallan's religious beliefs, though she will occasionally roll her eyes at the more ridiculous things.
</li><li> Jasnah's uncle Dalinar (who is himself devoutly religious) respects her greatly, partly because she chose to be honest and explain her lack of belief rather than pretending for the sake of appearances.
</li><li> One of Jasnah's most precious possessions is a book that a religious scholar used to <em>almost</em> successfully convert her. One of her biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments is when she gives it to Shallan following an apparent suicide attempt.
</li><li> When Shallan tells an ardent that Jasnah is researching the Voidbringers (ancient demons assumed to be myths at best), he assumes Jasnah is trying to disprove their existence, and thus disprove religion as a whole. Jasnah scoffs at this, saying that trying to prove a negative is a fool's errand, and destroying religion wouldn't really improve the world at all even if she could do it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jasnah:</strong> Let the Vorin believe as they wish—the wise among them will find goodness and solace in their faith; the fools would be fools no matter what they believed.

Not bad for an author who has never been shy about his own Christian beliefs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed">Discussed</a> in <em>Triggers</em>, where the US President is a closet atheist. Following numerous terrorist attacks in the US, culminating with his own near-assassination, he decides to destroy Pakistan with nuclear missiles for harboring terrorists. An old woman finds out about his nonbelief and this plan, trying to convince him that doing so will not only cause him to be viewed as a monster, but later people would say only an atheist could have done such a terrible thing (he had planned to admit his atheism after leaving the White House). Also averted by Caitlin and her dad in his earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WWWTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WWWTrilogy">WWWTrilogy</a></em>. Both are simply nice, ordinary people. Author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertJSawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertJSawyer">Robert J.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArcOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArcOfFire">Arc of Fire</a></em>: Averted. Myrren's doubts about Vraxor finally culminate in her disbelief that he exists, along with the other gods. The series itself has revealed she's wrong, as Vraxor and Nimrod appeared at the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkHeart">Dark Heart</a></em>, while Shial personally has encountered Shayna, though Myrren doesn't know this. Vraxor's holy book however may well be wrong, as she argues. Vraxor and Nimrod having both been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod">gone for a very long time</a> doesn't help to show that they exist of course. The author is himself an atheist activist, and thus explores this with more nuance than most, rather than just the usual negative stereotypes.
</li><li> Partly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ElmerGantry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ElmerGantry">Elmer Gantry</a></em>.

She especially stands out as she's an atheist <em>medicinecat</em>. Medicinecats are supposed to have a close relationship to StarClan.

Growing up in Flea Bottom and being told of some new "true god" in each new port he docked in made him consider that gods were something people made up to give themselves hope. This is in clear contrast to the Book canon, where Davos is the odd man out in Stannis's court not because he is an atheist, rather because he remains a firm believer in The Seven. Meanwhile, Thoros of Myr believed the gods were just something made up to scare children into being good. Thoros came to believe again after his prayer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">raised a man from the dead</a>, while Davos is more reluctant, though Stannis argues it would make no sense to disbelieve after what he's now seen Melisandre do. By season 6 he's come to conclude that the Lord does exist and is occasionally even helpful, but that he and his religion are evil.

Indeed, in the pilot episode Mike declares there is "no scientific proof" of God's existence, although his actual beliefs in several episodes later in the series reveal he is more agnostic (this view would also be compatible with agnostic atheism). The perfect case in point was "Edith's Crisis of Faith," where Edith renounces her deep Christian faith after witnessing a deadly robbery; Mike helps her reaffirm her faith by saying God would not want such a horrible thing to happen. Interestingly, Mike also loved Christmas, since the time celebrated the birth of Jesus, to him a kind, wise and benevolent philosopher, while viewing the idea he was the "son of God" as ridiculous.

Ironically, by the season finale, Florida and Carl are wed and move to Arizona as a way to explain Esther Rolle's departure from the series (due to her extreme dissatisfaction with the series' turn). Rolle also criticized the way she was being axed off-a devout Christian (Florida) marrying a hardcore atheist (Carl)-and when she returned to the show a year later, the producers agreed to her wish that Carl be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> from the show.

In one episode, where Nick is dating Sharon Lemure, he remarks that-after noting all the historical conflicts based on religion-only atheists seem to be truly happy and at peace.
</li><li> Lindsay Weir from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></em> is an atheist simply because in her view there is no rational reason to believe in god(s), though her atheism is also explained in the first episode as a reaction to seeing her grandmother die and hearing her say how there was no light and she was alone.
</li><li> The 2000s' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> features prominent atheist characters, all different.
<ul><li> Admiral Adama, a humanist who views mankind as flawed but inherently good, and ultimately accountable to nobody but themselves for their mistakes in life. While Adama explicitly states a few times that he's an atheist, he sees no problem with using humanity's faith as a rallying cry (such as in the infamous "So say we all!" scene) and accepting some of Roslin's more irrational endeavors (though he's opposed to them early on and nearly topples her government over it). He comes off as more of a pragmatist - seeming to accept that faith is necessary for people to have even though he doesn't share it himself.
</li><li> Gaius Baltar, an egocentrist who ultimately comes to consider <em>himself</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">a god</a> (or at least, a prophet). Baltar thinks of himself as an instrument of God (incidentally, the Big G hates it when you call Him that)-he was an atheist, but begins to believe there is something in "Hand of God"- with the apt final shot of the episode.
</li><li> The Cylon Brother Cavil/Number One Model, the only model to reject both the Cylon god and the Lords of Kobol, and the most sadistic and genocidal Cylon model to boot. While Cavil doesn't believe in God, he has no problem with using "God's will" and the "divine plan" to justify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">a grand agenda</a> which turns out to be based on little more than petty vengeance.
</li><li> In a deleted scene we find out that Billy Keikeya was also an atheist, despite being Laura Roslin's aide and most devoted supporter. By then Roslin was having prophetic visions and some people thought she was the messiah; Billy didn't believe in the gods, but he believed in Roslin. Though both scenes which were shot featuring Billy explicitly "confessing" his atheism to Roslin were deleted, you can still pick it up by observing his actions through the show (it's easier to see it once you've been told Billy is an atheist). It's mostly non-verbal-you see him sort of staring down and looking a little ashamed whenever Roslin rambles about Pythia, and in a couple of his scenes with Dualla, she implies her faith and he awkwardly changes the subject, his facial expression stuck somewhere between tolerance and pity.
</li><li> Gaeta's atheism is presented matter-of-factly, if mostly by implication: he has trouble taking Roslin's 'visions' seriously, and acknowledges to Adama at one point that he is 'not a man to look for religious explanations' of natural events, however convenient those events might be. His lack of faith in any gods is not considered a problem by other characters at any point.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> has Temperance Brennan, who argues with Seeley Booth (a strong Catholic) all the time about his faith and her lack of it. This is strong because they both make good points, and neither is instantly converted to the other's viewpoint. She is probably one of the most well-treated atheists on television. She frequently states her rationale for why she doesn't believe in a God in a calm manner - unsurprising, considering she's an anthropologist above all else - and nothing has ever been made of her being "wrong". She and her Catholic FBI partner get into frequent arguments over her atheism, but over the seasons, he's come to tease her affectionately over it. The arguments usually aren't "over Brennan's atheism", though. They're usually started because she'll occasionally come close to picking a fight with him over some aspect of his belief. This stands in contrast to how she's shown to not only be knowledgeable but openly respectful of pretty much every religion but the Jesus-as-savior ones. She tones it down later as she seems to realize she's antagonizing Booth for no particular reason, and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">entirely possible</a> there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> for why she has issues with Catholicism. In early episodes, it is clear that Brennan chafes at the idea of faith as being in opposition to reason. Over the years she herself starts demonstrating faith, specifically in her partnership with Booth. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This character development came to a head in the 8th season finale "The Secret in the Siege". After Brennan proposed to Booth, and he subsequently broke off their engagement (in response to serial killer Pelant's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>), Booth and Brennan's relationship seemed to be in serious trouble. At the end of the 9th season premiere "The Secret In the Proposal", Brennan assured Booth that she still had absolute faith in him and believed that he would make things right between them.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted">Inverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting">Moonlighting</a></em>. The snarky, somewhat dark, cynic David is a devout believer in God, while his life-affirming, successful partner from a good, loving family, Maddie, is an atheist.
</li><li> Subverted with Nichols in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em>, who indicates that he's an atheist simply because his parents raised him that way. In a second defiance of the trope, his atheism doesn't seem to define him; it's only a very minor attribute, which comes up exactly once in the entire series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em>, Father Dougal McGuire is shown in a number of episodes to have no belief in God or any other aspect of the Catholic faith. At one point he discusses the matter with a bishop having a crisis of faith, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism">who ends up resigning his post and becoming a hippie</a>. Of course, he wasn't <em>trying</em> to encourage him to leave the clergy. But this is Dougal we're talking about.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ted</strong>: Dougal, how exactly did you become a priest? Was it a "collect 10 crisp packets and become a priest" promotion?
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Grilled Cheesus" with Sue and Kurt: while Kurt expresses dislike of religious <em>institutions</em> because of what he considers their sexist, homophobic and anti-science attitudes, the arguments he uses in his conversations with the other Gleeks about god and faith are mostly the same as those used by intellectual atheists, including Russell's teapot and a brief reference to the Flying Spaghetti Monster. It's also implied that his atheism is of long standing - his speech about his mother's funeral makes it clear that even as an eight-year-old he had no belief in any sort of after life. On the other hand, he does try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">stop people from praying for his father when he's in the hospital</a>, despite the fact that his father is religious and would most likely <em>want</em> people to pray for him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint">Probably because they were making an obnoxious production of their prayers despite almost none of them knowing Burt personally</a>.
</li><li> Sue, on the other hand comes off as mostly angry at God for giving her sister Down syndrome and tries to stop the students from singing about their religious beliefs - though to be fair, this is also at least partly because their insistence on doing so is causing Kurt, whose father is in a coma after a serious heart attack at this point, considerable stress. Even better, while they both make their peace with the religious (or bow to religious privilege), neither is converted by the end of the episode.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Finn sings a song about losing faith and the episode treated it in a very cool manner. It's still rare to find a show that's not afraid of sending the message "some people lose their faith; that's ok". Finn's emotional distress at losing his faith in his Grilled Cheesus is not in itself made light of. It's just presented as the logical consequence of a certain rather shallow and opportunistic sort of faith being challenged. The editing of the song sequence does, however, imply that Finn thinks Kurt, as an atheist, feels the same confusion and isolation Finn is experiencing <em>all the time</em> - while making it clear that actually, Kurt doesn't, and that his sympathy for Finn's situation is, for various reasons, not great.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Christmas episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E12ComparativeReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E12ComparativeReligion">Comparative Religion</a>" we learn that Britta is an atheist and Jeff's agnostic, but neither is particularly bitter or obnoxious about it. Both go out of their way to politely accommodate Shirley's overtly Christian holiday plans, and Shirley's actually the more obnoxious when it comes to other people's beliefs here. As the series has progressed, however, Britta has gotten a bit more in-your-face about her atheism, especially when mixing it up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">Shirley</a>.
</li><li> The clash between this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">The Fundamentalist</a> was played with in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS3E07StudiesInModernMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS3E07StudiesInModernMovement">Studies in Modern Movement</a>. After Shirley insinuates that Britta doesn't have a moral code because of her lack of religion, Britta picks up a hitchhiker specifically to show the opposite. This backfires on Britta when the hitchhiker is himself a staunch Christian. It then backfires on <em>Shirley</em> when he's also a big supporter of legalizing weed, and believes himself to be Jesus. They finally come together with the reveal that he's <em>incredibly racist</em> and doesn't think blacks and whites should mix. Oh, and he drinks human blood.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>, Dean used to be an atheist, at least until he met Castiel and other angels. And later God himself. Now his believing in God is rather pragmatic, not really motivated by faith. <em>Supernatural</em> is interesting in the regard that his atheism seemed only to apply to the Christian god. A couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonstersOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonstersOfTheWeek">Monsters of the Week</a> were, in fact, pagan gods.
<ul><li> Granted, given how many of those pagan gods they've killed it's not hard to imagine they were just more powerful-than-usual monsters that some people used to worship/placate.

<ul><li> Alicia is an open atheist but isn't shown to be a worse person for it. In fact, although her daughter Grace is a born-again Christian, these different beliefs never affect their relationship. "Dear God" has Alicia needing help dealing with a venue change to a Christian arbitrator rather than a courtroom, and she goes to Grace for advice on how to use the Bible as a legal document.
</li><li> This was first revealed when Eli planned to use a video of Maddie Hayward refusing to take part in a public prayer against her gubernatorial campaign (she's one of Peter's opponents and Eli's just doing his job as campaign manager), but she short-circuits him by telling a reporter who catches all four of them at a dinner that she felt it would be hypocritical of her to go through the motions as an atheist. Peter tells the reporter he respects that, though he doesn't agree with her. The reporter then queries Alicia, who states she's an atheist as well.
</li><li> Alicia herself invokes this when she's involved with a custody case against a philosophy professor. She uses the fact that he doesn't believe in an afterlife, free will or anything immaterial as evidence that he would be a worse parent to his son than the child's mother. However, the professor defends himself against her accusations ably (which seem to partly stem from the recent loss of her friend-the professor's opinion that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">existence ends at death</a> upsets her).
</li><li> It comes back to bite Alicia when she's running for State's Attorney, as many people in the US believe this trope to be true. She's advised that open atheists are unelectable. Thus, she's forced to backtrack on her admission of being one into calling herself "questioning" after Will's death and her daughter's influence. She's obviously very uncomfortable with this, as is Grace when her prayer group leader gives thanks for her supposedly getting through to Alicia.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalibuCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalibuCountry">Malibu Country</a></em>: Nicely averted when June admits she's an atheist. Reba respects this, along with her desire to not attend church anymore.

However, it's revealed later that Vinick had actually stopped believing in God and Christianity many years before his wife's death, after reading the Bible cover to cover.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMessengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMessengers">The Messengers</a></em>: This is averted with Vera, who as an atheist initially doubts the things she's told at the start of the series but comes to believe when shown incontrovertible evidence, and is not shown as wrong for doubting earlier or otherwise portrayed poorly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>: Corporal Klinger at first seems to be a Catholic. Several seasons in Father Mulcahey catches Klinger praying. Mulcahey questions him, asking why he would do this, being an atheist. Klinger responds, "Gave it up for Lent." In other episodes, indications that he's a Muslim appear, for instance referring to Allah or saying he prayed that Allah would help Mulcahy. In any case, he is always positively, if pretty eccentric.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1985">The Twilight Zone (1985)</a></em>: Averted in "The Star", based on the story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, which has an atheist named Chandler who's friendly with a Jesuit priest, Matthew Costigan, and they seem to have frequent polite debates on God's existence. Both are scientists on a space ship which picks up a signal from an ancient civilization whose star went supernova thousands of years ago. Chandler questions how God could do this to an entire species. Then once Costigan discovers that the light of the supernova is what was seen as the Star of Bethlehem, Costigan has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith">Crisis of Faith</a> at the idea these kind, peaceful aliens were sacrificed to herald Christ's birth. Chandler, however, apologizes for his prior criticism, seeing him distraught. He then shows Costigan a last message that the aliens left, saying not to mourn for them because they had lived full, rich, happy lives, a sentiment they both find uplifting. This is a kinder ending than the original story, in which the priest despairs at what he's learned, with no message from the aliens to save his faith.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Manifest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Manifest">Manifest</a></em>: Ben is briefly mentioned as being an atheist, but except for some snarky comments by Michaela, this isn't portrayed poorly.

This is not shown to be bad (nor does she begin to pray, though Kathryn says God won't mind).

Rebecca is an atheist, but also one of the most heroic characters. Franklyn is as well, but does very bad things. However it's never indicated to be a result of his atheism, and he's also not portrayed with any stereotypical traits besides this. He's no different than many other characters, and does good too (along with him displaying actual remorse).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>: Leonard's father Alfred is an agnostic who believes in science, but he's open to the possibility that God exists and doesn't judge people based on what they believe. He's also genuinely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>. This makes him a sharp contrast to both his ex-wife Beverly, who plays it straight, and Sheldon's mother Mary, who is a religious fundamentalist.

Later we learn that his father wasn't particularly religious either, so his atheism probably wasn't entirely caused by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being Doctor Manhattan</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em>: Ogilvy firmly replies that he doesn't believe in God when Amy asks him. She doesn't appear to be entirely comfortable with this, but it's overall averted. Ogilvy is not only a kind man and brilliant scientist, he likely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>saved humanity</em> through figuring out how to kill the red weed.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BobHeartsAbishola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BobHeartsAbishola">Bob Hearts Abishola</a></em>: The titular Bob is a curious example. He is shown praying to God in "Ralph Lauren and Fish" when his mother has a stroke, but "A Big, White Thumb" establishes that Bob is not religious and the prayer was merely a "foxhole" moment. Bob and his siblings weren't raised to follow any religion due to their parents wanting the children to make their own choice rather than have religion shoved down their throats like they did. When Abishola asks Bob to accompany her to church, he is hesitant to go and while he doesn't say he's an atheist, he does make many condescending comments about the family's Christian beliefs (including calling himself "sensible" instead of an atheist). He later calls Abishola and apologizes for his remarks while agreeing to give church a try. The experience is very unenjoyable for Bob as the arrogant minister puts him on the spot and basically forces him to accept Christ into his heart, which Bob only does to get him off his back. Abishola struggles to accept Bob's lack of belief, but Bob puts it to rest when he tells her that while he doesn't know if he believes in God (perhaps he's agnostic instead of an atheist), he does believe in miracles, hence why a woman like Abishola gave Bob a chance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOutpost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOutpost">The Outpost</a></em>: Averted with Janzo, who's mentioned as not believing in the gods, but this comes after he kindly offers to pray with Naya over her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mother and sister dying</span>. This fits with his generally kind, caring nature. Further, he's a great hero in his right, having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">found the cure for a deadly disease.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dates">Dates</a></em>: Averted. Jenny tells Christian (whose religion appears to be very important) that she doesn't believe in God due to the problem of evil. He respects this, and she's portrayed sympathetically (kleptomania notwithstanding).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AFrenchVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AFrenchVillage">A French Village</a></em>: Müller states he doesn't believe in God at one point, while he's quite the brutal agent with the German SD, torturing suspects regularly. Judith, however, is a good character and says she's not a believer, along with Jules. Mr. Cohen is an atheist too and portrayed quite sympathetically.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a> campaign setting also had the Athar faction, who's big thing was that they believed the gods weren't really gods, just really, really powerful mortals with huge egos, as evidenced by the fact that the gods could be killed. Like the ur-Priest Prestige Class, they had the ability to muck up divine magic but lacked the "must be evil" restriction on their alignment. They were frequently portrayed as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> characters, however. An interesting twist with the Athar is that more than a few of them weren't actually <em>atheists</em> as we'd see it — they believed in a divinity of sorts, they just didn't agree that the beings generally called gods were really divine. The Athar's <em>leader</em> is a subversion. While most Athar join the faction due to being betrayed or disillusioned from their gods and are generally bitter and angry, Factol Terrance simply woke up one morning and realized that he simply did not have faith in his god any longer, so he left his clerical position and joined the Athar. Terrance is also one of the most stable, sane and generally pleasant leaders of any of the Planescape factions.
