More often than not, they can be roughly described as follows:
</p><ul><li> The Beautiful Sister: An attractive, outgoing, fashionable, popular, but unintellectual character. If older, she'll be more mature in "womanly" ways. Can range from smart yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrainlessBeauty">The Brainless Beauty</a>. Endlessly criticizes her sister for her willing social outsiderness.
</li><li> The Smart Sister: A bookish, explicitly smart character. Very often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight">The Snark Knight</a>. Very socially awkward and subject to far less male attention, although this often has more to do with her personality than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">her appearance</a>. Endlessly criticizes her sister for her willing or apparent shallowness.
</li></ul><p>While it is usually made clear that they love each other, the sisters are constant verbal combatants. Most of the time they find each other incomprehensible. Sometimes they both harbour a secret inferiority complex. After all, calling someone "The Smart Sister" implies that she isn't pretty, and vice-versa. The sisters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTriangle">may become love rivals</a>, but often they prefer very different types. The smart sister is usually the more sympathetic of the two, either an explicit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> or the character preferred by fans. This is often the result of writers themselves having been the Smart One growing up and thus often projecting their own feelings onto her, though many a reader can relate (and project too).

<ul><li> Urd and Skuld of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> play with this Trope six ways 'til Sunday. While Urd is the Popular Sister and Skuld is the Smart Sister, Urd is no intellectual slouch herself (and quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>), and Skuld can be either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Bratty Half-Pint</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a>. Still, they have their sweet moments. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">To add to the hilarity</a>, they're also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveObstructingParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveObstructingParents">Love-Obstructing Parents</a>; they have a middle "child", Belldandy (who <em>is</em> a happy medium between the two, incidentally, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">real sweetheart</a>), and live under the roof of Keiichi Morisato — while Urd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">makes attempts to bring the two together</a>, Skuld sees Keiichi as a rival for Belldandy's attention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingTorpedo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingTorpedo">and tries to keep the two apart.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus">Blood+</a></em>: Saya is the "Smart" Sister, though she's not so much snarky or intelligent so much as she embraces her humanity <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and excludes herself from the world because of her deathwish</span>. Diva is the Beautiful Sister, and is well aware of her sex appeal and how to use it, and wants to create a world where she can live openly and as she sees fit. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0jazu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0jazu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0jazu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As a side note, they are literally at war with each other.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> plays around with this trope. Nabiki is not so much "smart" as she is "cunning" and enormously popular with the guys even when <em>everyone</em> knows she only dates them in order to fleece them for all they're worth. Also, it's "Beautiful" Akane who criticizes Nabiki for her shallowness and materialistic attitude.
</li><li> Momo and Nana Deviluke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em>, even more so in the sequel <em>Darkness</em>. Momo, the younger one, is more extroverted, devious, scheming, sexually active, comfortable herself and quite popular, while Nana, far from bookish or unpopular, is far more straightforward, cynical, sheltered and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a>.
</li><li> Karala (the popular younger sister) and Harulu (the smart older one) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon">Space Runaway Ideon</a></em> go for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">Cain and Abel</a> route.
</li><li> Poor Misty from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> has to deal with Popular <em>Triplet</em> Sisters! It doesn't help that while not bad people, Daisy, Violet, and Lily are completely irresponsible Gym Leaders as well, causing Misty to leave Ash and Brock at the end of Johto.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe">Minami-ke</a></em> spreads the trope over three sisters instead of two, though it's largely borne by Kana (the Popular Sister, minus the actual popularity) and Chiaki (mostly the Smart Sister). Eldest Haruka picks up the "popularity" aspect of Popular Sister and "responsibility" fragments of the Smart Sister role. The warring is entirely between Kana and Chiaki as well and is mostly over Kana wanting Chiaki to participate in her shenanigans, and Chiaki calling Kana an idiot and preferring her <strong>own</strong> shenanigans.
</li><li> Hinagiku and Yukiji Katsura of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> could qualify. Popularity isn't quite as significant though. Hinagiku is the school idol and Yukiji is a teacher but noticeably less popular. Yukiji likes to drink and is constantly wasting money, while Hina is the student council president, president of the kendo club and seems to be good with money, at least to the effect of lending large amounts to her sister.
<ul><li> The two also apparently have the rivalry of their foster parents' affections. Yukiji is favored by their father while Hinagiku is for their mother.
</li><li> It seems while it isn't a point of contention to cause the two to argue, Yukiji does have a grudge over her sister's popularity. And Hinagiku doesn't seem to have any reluctance to harm her sister, particularly when Yukiji barges in on her changing. OTOH, though, Hina is shown to have quite a bit of respect for her older sister, using 'onee-san' even while berating.
</li></ul></li><li> Semi-averted by Momiji Fujimiya (Beautiful) and Kaede Kunikida (Smart), the fraternal twin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">Cain and Abel</a> sisters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueSeed">Blue Seed</a></em>. Since they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth">Separated at Birth</a> Momiji didn't even know she had a twin older sister until they came into conflict <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as Kaede has grown massively disillusioned of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden">Barrier Maiden</a> deal</span>, though in the end, Momiji is able to use her pure-hearted belief in their sisterhood to her advantage <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> so she can bring Kaede back from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. (Which turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a> plan in the end)</span>.
</li><li> Narumi (beautiful) and Kurumi (smart) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em>. They adore each other, yes, but Kurumi also feels very awkward as she feels Narumi is overshadowing her.
</li><li> Agon and Unsui of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> are probably the closest example of a male version of this trope. Agon is popular (especially with women), arrogant, shallow, lazy and condescending. Unsui is reserved, analytical, serious, hard-working, and eternally overshadowed by his brother in every way. They don't necessarily argue, but Unsui often scolds Agon for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> and Agon loves to tease his brother.
</li><li> Slightly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> as beautiful Rachel Durless apparently never feels threatened by smart Angelina, while Angelina feels deeply envious of Rachel but still loves her dearly and the main reason she wants to be a doctor is to help her older sister who is asthmatic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not helped by how Earl Vincent Phantomhive, the love of Angelina's life, marries Rachel, has Ciel with her... and they're both murdered a few years later.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em> has the Anarchy sisters, with Panty being the Beautiful One and Stocking being the Smart One. When they're not fighting Ghosts, they are often quarreling with each other, especially in "Transwhoremers".
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>. In the early chapters, there is a running gag where Rukia is often seen reading a shojo manga, which, according to supplemental materials from the tankoban, is about two sisters having a private war over a box left to them by their dead mother.
<ul><li> In-series, this is averted by the Kotetsu sisters. Older sister Isane is the "Beautiful" one since she's a kind and softspoken healer, while younger sister Kiyone is the "smart" one thanks to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead">Fiery Redhead</a>, but they get along pretty well as we can see.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mina (beautiful) and Masayo (smart) Aoshima. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Taken to horrible levels when Masayo <em>kills</em> Mina over a huge misunderstanding.</span>
</li><li> Also, in Detective Conan Special, the Matsumoto sisters.

The eldest, referred to as darker and "coal-black", grows jealous of the younger, "bright as is the sun" sister as she wins the favor of the man they were romantically competing for. The eldest murders the youngest, nearly getting away with it had it not been for divine intervention at the end. The eldest is usually depicted as being not as beautiful as the younger, but clever enough to almost get away with murdering her sister. That would make the eldest the smart sister, while the younger is the beautiful one.

Their relationship seems to straddle the line between truly loving each other and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">Cain and Abel</a>: you cannot leave them alone in the same room for ten minutes without each finding novel ways to hurt the other. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Both of them are horribly broken upon their being separated</a>, and actively start missing/ mourning each other greatly (neither know that the other is alive).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em> examines the trope in some way, before it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">was even a trope yet</a>. The two eldest Bennet daughters Jane and Lizzie are both smart and pretty, but one trait overshadows the other in each case — Jane being the pretty one of the family but a little too naive and trusting, while Lizzie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedYoungLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedYoungLady">Spirited Young Lady</a>-like nature preventing her from being thought as pretty and as conventionally lady-like as Jane but her wit and intelligence make up for it. They embody the positive qualities of the smart and pretty sisters, while their three younger sisters embody the negatives. Mary the wannabe smart sister is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a> who cares more about forcing her opinions on others and appearing smart than actually cultivating her mind. Lydia and Kitty are the wannabe pretty sisters but are silly vapid boy-crazy idiots who embarrass the family at every possible interval. They're all single at the beginning story and their air-headed mother considers match-making and husband-hunting a competition.
</li><li> Elinor and Marianne Dashwood in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em> have some elements of this (their younger sister barely has a presence to speak of). They're both beautiful, intelligent, well-read and proficient artists — Elinor paints and draws while Marianne sings and plays the piano. They're very close and love each other dearly. However, Elinor is slightly less beautiful and way more reasonable, responsible and levelheaded, while Marianne is considered a more striking beauty, and she's also overly passionate and not prudent enough, especially considering her intelligence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion">Persuasion</a></em>: Anne and Elizabeth Elliot. They have a younger married sister, Mary, who thinks she won, and she did in some ways because of her prosperous marriage at a young age. Elizabeth is the beautiful sister — a vain woman, proud of her beauty and her blue blood, dissatisfied only with the family's debts and her still being single when she's almost thirty. Anne is the smart sister — keenly intelligent, sensitive, selfless and kind to everyone, even to people who don't deserve it. Elizabeth and Anne are very close in age but their position in society is vastly different. Elizabeth is the mistress of their father's house and one of the most prominent ladies of their social circle (she's second only after Lady Russell, their widowed and titled friend). She's also their father's favourite child. Anne is neglected and overlooked by both Elizabeth and their silly father.

Both are beautiful and bright. Maria is elder and the more beautiful sister. Julia is also attractive, just not as pretty. Also, Maria is coddled more by their aunt Norris. They get on well until Henry Crawford comes to Mansfield. They soon become enamoured with him and compete for his attention and love.

<ul><li> Claudia and Janine, and this is apparently hereditary. Their mother, Rioko, is a librarian, and her sister, nicknamed Peaches, is something of a wild child. (<em>Their</em> mother says she got along beautifully with her sister, however.) Unusually, Claudia (the Popular One) is one of the main characters, whereas Janine (the Smart One) is merely part of the supporting cast.
</li><li> Marilyn and Carolyn Arnold; Dawn and Mary Anne exhibit signs of this in the early days of their stepsisterhood.

<ul><li> Jo (Smart) and Meg (Beautiful) fit in technically speaking, but end up subverting the trope. Aside from Meg chiding Jo once in a while for being tactless and too outspoken, they get along pretty well and Jo considers Meg her best friend. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jo even shows jealousy towards John Brooke when he's revealed to have feelings for Meg, as she's afraid that she'll lose Meg's emotional support.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Meg Cabot's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllAmericanGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllAmericanGirl">All-American Girl</a></em> has a set of three sisters where the protagonist has an inferiority complex because her older sister is the Popular One and her younger sister is the Smart One. She herself is Artistic. The main rivalry is between the protagonist and her older, popular sister as they are closer in age and the youngest is so smart she considers rivalries petty.
</li><li> Laura and Mary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Ingalls</a> have elements of this. Mary is very pretty and perfectly well-behaved, while Laura is active, energetic, and brave. Some subversion in that they're both pretty smart, though. They laugh about it when they're older. (They also have two younger sisters, Carrie and Grace, but their ages and personalities don't lend themselves to the trope.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subversion</a>: In the first book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheSpiderQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheSpiderQueen">War of the Spider Queen</a></em> hexad, Pharaun's sisters Sabal and Greyanna have one of these... except that they're said to be identical in both looks and personality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">(not that Sabal gets much personality given to her)</a>.

</li><li> The entire point of Philippa Gregory's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOtherBoleynGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOtherBoleynGirl">The Other Boleyn Girl</a></em> is the rivalry between Anne Boleyn and her younger, less famous sister Mary. Interestingly enough, neither of them fit completely into the stereotypes listed. Anne would be the "Popular Sister," yet she is far more intelligent than Mary. Accordingly, Mary would be the "Smart Sister," except she's not as smart as Anne, and is generally considered more beautiful. What it really comes down to is Anne knows how to work the court and has heaping piles of ambition, while Mary just wants to raise her children in the country. The true fit in the types comes in that Anne is far more shallow than Mary.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deenie">Deenie</a></em>: Their mother frequently tells people (including complete strangers) that "Deenie's the beauty, Helen's the brain." At one point Helen tells Deenie she doesn't have to fall into the role their mother has chosen for her.
</li><li> A version of this appears in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Old Testament</a> book of Genesis. Jacob falls in love with Rachel, but on their wedding day, her father substitutes her older, less attractive sister Leah as the bride. Jacob subsequently marries Rachel as well, and for some years the two women try to outdo one another in giving him children (apparently, Leah desperately prayed to God to be appreciated by Jacob, so He took pity on her and made her able to bear children, leaving Rachel barren until the last two); they even get their (slave) maids involved.
</li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TippingTheVelvet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TippingTheVelvet">Tipping the Velvet</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Affinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Affinity">Affinity</a></em> by Sarah Waters, the protagonist is the Smart One (and very gay), their sister the better looking, popular one. Both relationships are problematic- Nan's sister Alice never comes to term with her sister being gay, Margaret's jealous of Pris for being so normal (though will never own up to this).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a> references this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmAmericaAndSoCanYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmAmericaAndSoCanYou">I Am America (And So Can You!)</a></em>, in the chapter about family (which is appropriately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily">fraught with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSuburbia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSuburbia">distressing subtext about the nuclear American family</a>).

</li><li> This trope is the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> grew up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleFosterParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleFosterParents">Muggle Foster Parents</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">hated him</a> (well, and that whole Voldemort thing). Harry's treatment by his Aunt Petunia was essentially revenge against his mother/her younger sister Lily for being the better sister (it seems Lily got the looks <em>and</em> the brains <em>and</em> was a witch to boot — no wonder Petunia was so jealous). That's not the reason Vernon abused him, of course, but that's a moot point since Petunia wouldn't be married to someone like Vernon if she hadn't chosen to be like that.

<ul><li> Lucy and Susan — it's hardly the focus of the books, but there are hints at times. Susan is older and considered more conventionally pretty, often takes a superior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a>-type approach to the problems the kids encounter, and of course is the one who ends up "outgrowing" Narnia as a young woman to focus on her social life. Lucy is the youngest of the four and has the closest relationship with Aslan, which Susan sometimes tries to step on, apparently thinking Lucy is acting spoiled or attention-seeking. And when Lucy is in the magician's house in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheDawnTreader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheDawnTreader">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></em>, for instance, and reads the spell for making yourself beautiful, one of the things she sees in the illustrations is Susan looking plainer than usual and consumed with envy. The unspecified ages of the Pevensies throughout the books make all this a little harder to pin down, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagiciansNephew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagiciansNephew">The Magician's Nephew</a></em> alludes to it in what little backstory we get concerning Jadis and her unnamed sister. Apparently the two started a war over their rights to the throne, one that ended with Jadis speaking the Deplorable Word in order to wipe out everything other than herself. Better that than let her sister take the throne, according to her.

Oddly enough, Dicey and Maybeth have the makings of this (the former being a tough tomboy and the latter being sweet and girly), but subvert this as each sister finds the other's opposite trait from hers to be comforting.

</li><li> Michelle Magorian's <em>A Little Love Song/Not a Swan</em> is about Rose (the smart one) and her big sister Diana (the beautiful one). At first, we only get Rose's side of the story, since she's the main character, which is that everyone likes Diana better because she's prettier, including their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">recently deceased father</a>. When they finally talk about it, it turns out that Diana herself is convinced that their father liked Rose best because of her intelligence and that he never took anything Diana said seriously. Diana also feels lonely because girls generally don't like her and boys are so mesmerized by her looks that they can't talk to her.

Elin is the plain-looking sister, who is clever enough to become the local medicine woman. Gertrud is the beautiful sister, who is more frivolous and sociable than Elin. However, the true conflict only starts when Gertrud runs off with a penniless fiddler and disgraces the family. Elin will never forgive her for this, especially as she's secretly in love with Gertrud's fiancé and sees how he's hurt by her betrayal. It is later revealed that Elin also felt that Gertrud was their mother's favorite even after the scandal, which would make her bitterness if possible even worse. Gertrud meets a tragic death only a year or so after she left with the fiddler, but even that can't make Elin forgive her. And even on her own deathbed years later, Elin is unable to say one positive thing about her sister. And it becomes even sadder when you realize that Gertrud apparently never wanted this poisonous relationship with her sister, but it was all on Elin's side.

The reason is a simple one: Granny has a wealth of resentment against her older sister Lily, who became a witch first and got to leave home and do all the interesting things with Witchcraft that Granny longed to do herself. But Esme was then forced into the role of Good Witch, having to stay at home in Lancre and do all the boring and humdrum everyday "good witch" things. Esmerelda takes a long-awaited vengeance on Lilith — who tries equally hard to thwart and if possible to kill her sister. And does some good as a side-effect.

</li><li> In this case, six sisters (or, according to one side's opinion, only four). And it isn't pretty. Seventies/Eighties singing family <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNolanSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNolanSisters">The Nolan Sisters</a> appear to have split into two separate rival factions who are mutually not at home to each other. Let us call these the Provisional and Official wings of the Nolan family, as it does appear to have got this bloody and this Irish. Relations were soured when the oldest sister made abuse allegations against her (now deceased) father that were hotly denied by the horrified rest of her family. It was pointed out that the oldest sister is bankrupt and in desperate need of the money only a shock/horror autobiography could bring in. Offered a lucrative reunion tour and recording deal, the rest of the sisterhood retaliated by cutting the oldest out of the contact. On top of this, a sixth sister who left the band just as they became famous was miffed to discover the sisters were reforming, and she had not been invited. Lawyers have been brandished and opening shots fired. Official family history has been airbrushed to make it look as if there were only ever four Nolan Sisters (Maureen, Linda, Bernadette, and Colleen). Anne and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest">Denise Nolan</a> are said to be just a wee fecken' bit offended that they no longer exist, and are seeking to prove their corporeal integrity, to the satisfaction of Church, State and Courts. (If nothing else, they are credited on the first few LP's and an awful lot of TV work the girls did....) Watch this space.
<ul><li> Family relations have "normalized" somewhat and something of a Good Friday Agreement has been entered into following the tragic and premature death of Bernadette Nolan. However, the youngest and most successful Sister, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow">TV presenter Colleen</a>, almost immediately set about getting her retaliation in first, via an autobiography serialised in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">the Daily Mirror</a></em>.

We do find out more about them as the story goes on:
<ul><li> Nova takes a moment to share some rather embarrassing details about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Vera's disastrous dating life with the party and that her no-nonsense persona is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">really just a front she puts on for work</a>. In reality, she is really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">not good with people</a> and can't carry on a normal conversation without it turning into awkward silence, which explains why her record for being able to hold on to a boyfriend is only a month (and that this guy lost 30 lbs. trying to put up with Vera), and every time after a breakup she inevitably ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows">drowning her sorrows</a> while complaining to Nova.

<ul><li> Daria Morgendorffer is the titular character and the smart one, her sister Quinn is the red-headed popular one. However, Quinn is shown to be fairly intelligent in her own right (which actually <em>scares</em> her, fearing she'd be kicked out of her clique), and Daria is shown to be fairly attractive when she makese an effort (which actually <em>scares</em> her, fearing it makes her as shallow as the conformist students she rails against). The sisters do begin to make peace in the final season. In the episode "Quinn the Brain", Quinn embraces a shallow sort of intellectualism because the dimmer wits wandering the school find her crappy poetry profound. Daria finds this even worse than her normal, self-imposed ditziness; as much as she hates her sister's default state, she hates discarding personal integrity in favor of pleasing the masses even more, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWantOurJerkBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWantOurJerkBack">she works to restore the status quo</a> (even willing to give herself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong">a temporary makeover</a>), if only so that their relationship can remain at "rivalry" as opposed to out-and-out holy war.
</li><li> Turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a> to some extent: their mother, Helen, has an acrimonious relationship with her older sister Rita, and to a lesser extent their younger sister Amy. Rita seems to be the pretty one, Amy the smart one, and Helen the overachiever who's become the most successful. Interestingly, each sister has their own gripes towards the other two. Despite being spoiled the most by their mother, Rita felt that Helen's achievements made Amy and herself look lazy; whereas Amy got out of doing anything for the family by shutting herself in. By comparison, Amy feels that Helen was too high strung/high maintenance (going as far to congratulate Jake for putting up with her) and resented the constant attention that Rita got from their mother which in turn led to Amy constantly withdrawing herself. Witnessing all this leads Daria and Quinn to decide that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">they don't want to feel that kind of resentment toward each other twenty years down the line and start working to get along with each other better</a>.

In fact, a good part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">Sibling Rivalry</a> tropes are averted in the cartoon: while the kids <em>did</em> have their disagreements, <em>extended</em> rivalries didn't really happen.
</li><li> An adult example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AKindOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AKindOfMagic">A Kind of Magic</a></em> has Willow, a cheerful fairy, and Ferocia, an evil witch.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sixteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sixteen">6teen</a></em> has Jen as The Smart One and Courtney as The Beautiful One in "It's Always Courtney, Courtney, Courtney".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em> has Abigail Lincoln, a.k.a. Numbuh Five, and her sister, Cree. This show takes this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> since Cree is a teenager and a sworn enemy of the Kids Next Door, in which Numbuh Five is involved. Cree was once a KND operative herself, known as Numbuh 11, and the sisters got along rather well then, but when Cree got older, she was no longer allowed in the KND but escaped being decommissioned. This has also somewhat caused their personal relationship to sour as well. One scene shows them at the dinner table pretending to get along, when in fact they're secretly aiming weapons at each other under the table.
</li><li> This trope appears several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> First off, we have Celestia and Luna, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">embodiements of day and night</a>. Older sister Celestia is the Popular One — the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God Empress</a> of Equestria who brings daylight to the land, beloved by all of her people — while the younger Luna shows traces of the Smart One (she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> including being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker">Dream Walker</a>) and, in her opinion, isn't as well-liked, because everypony is asleep when she delivers nighttime to the world. Luna's jealousy of Celestia's popularity eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">transforms her into the monstrous Nightmare Moon</a>, which in turn forces Celestia to banish her to the moon for a thousand years. By the end of the pilot, Luna has been healed, and the two sisters mend their relationship (though a few later episodes, and the tie-in comics, hint that they're still rivals, though to a far lesser extent). This is the central conflict in the Season 7 episode "A Royal Problem", with both sisters being upset with each other because they believe that the other has the easier job. Luna thinks Celestia has it easy basking in the love and adoration of her subjects. Celestia thinks Luna has it easy dealing with dreams instead of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">Slave to PR</a>.
</li><li> Among the Mane Six, we have Rarity and Sweetie Belle. Like Celestia, Rarity is the Popular One and older of the two, a prim-and-proper pony who works as a seamstress/fashion designer and loves high society. Like Luna, Sweetie Belle is younger, and while not the polar opposite of her sister, she's far more energetic and playful, which contrasts with Rarity's posh attitude. Both Sweetie Belle-centric episodes ("Sisterhooves Social" and "For Whom the Sweetie Belle Tolls") focus on the contrast between the sisters, with Sweetie becoming particularly jealous of Rarity and either declaring that she doesn't want to be her sister or intentionally sabotaging one of Rarity's important clients. Rarity and Sweetie Belle's relationship has been expressly compared to Princess Celestia and Princess Luna's <em>by Luna herself!</em>
</li><li> The trope is downplayed with Pinkie and Maud Pie. Pinkie is the younger sister and Popular One — she's quite literally the embodiment of fun and laughter, has a bright pink color, and works as a party planner and apprentice baker in Ponyville. Older sister Maud is the Smart One — she's an expert on rocks who is receiving a doctorate in the field, is dull gray, and has a single friend (a small pebble). Both sisters are well aware of their severe contrast but don't try to change for one another and never ask each other to. This is perhaps best symbolized by the Pies' tradition of exchanging rock candy necklaces whenever they see each other — Pinkie loves sugar and always devours hers right away, while Maud doesn't care for sweets and keeps them in a small box. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">despite their differences, they love each other dearly</a>.
</li><li> Finally, the trope is largely averted with Applejack and Apple Bloom. Both have pretty much the same personality — headstrong, hard-working, and compassionate — and get along extremely well. The only tension in their relationship was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">single incident</a> in "Somepony to Watch Over Me" where Applejack thought that Apple Bloom needed to be kept safe and babied her to an absurd degree.
</li></ul></li><li> Alice Tompkins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> has a decades-long rivalry with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle">Southern Belle</a> sister, Miranda, who for the most part, is considered to be more attractive, and deliberately tries to upstage Alice every chance she gets, even at Alice's wedding. When Miranda finally admits to her sister that she's jealous of the life that she has with her job, her daughter, and her relationship with Jay, Alice takes a brief moment to rejoice.

Until the international situation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">began to get really dire</a>, they behaved almost <em>exactly</em> like every other pair of arguing teenagers. Did we mention they shared a room? Well, they shared a room — which, as soon as their politics were cemented, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMySide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMySide">split down the middle with a chalk line</a> and decorated on each side in the symbols of their ideologies (Unity in swastikas and pictures of Hitler, 'Decca' in hammers and sickles and pictures of Lenin).
<ul><li> What makes this really sad is that there's evidence that when they were children Unity and 'Decca' were very close and shared a secret society and language, among other examples.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiaryOfAYoungGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiaryOfAYoungGirl">Anne Frank's diary</a> is full of this kind of thing about her older sister Margot, who she claimed was prettier, nicer, smarter, more mature, and just "better," in contrast to Anne's adolescent awkwardness and mood swings. She also wrote about times she thought her parents were favoring Margot over her.
</li><li> This was the relationship between the Tudor Queens of England, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryTudor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryTudor">"Bloody" Mary I</a> and her younger half-sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Elizabeth I</a>. Mary's happy childhood as the only surviving child of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a> came to a crashing halt when Henry took up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AnneBoleyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AnneBoleyn">Anne Boleyn</a>, for whom he divorced Mary's mother Catherine of Aragon. Anne was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">infamously cruel to Mary</a>, persuading Henry to strip his daughter of her rightful title of 'Princess' and even forcing her to be a nursemaid to the infant who supplanted her as heir to the throne. Nevertheless, the much-older Mary was fond of her little sister and also their mutual half-brother Edward (later Edward VI). As Elizabeth grew older, however, Mary began to see her as a rival, a fact which was cemented during Mary's queenship. Their opposing religions did not help; Mary was a steadfast Catholic (under the influence of her devout Spanish mother) while Elizabeth had been reared in the (Protestant) Church of England. When Mary became Queen, Protestant plots to depose her and place Elizabeth on the throne resulted in Elizabeth being arrested and imprisoned several times. Elizabeth was much younger, prettier, and much, much smarter than poor Mary; she was unhappy, aging badly, despised by her subjects, unable to have children, and eventually died of a tumor. Against her inclination, she had no choice but to leave the throne to the sister she resented.
<ul><li> It has been speculated that the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">Queen Elizabeth</a> was not immune to this effect. Princess Elizabeth was never intended to be a contender to the throne: her father George, after all, was merely the younger brother of King Edward VIII, a man who, barring accident or the unthinkable act — abdication — was set to be King until well into the twentieth century. But events conspired, her father ascended a tarnished throne as King George VI, led a country through WW2, and died young in 1952, so the eldest of his two daughters became Queen Elizabeth II. The ongoing calculated bad behaviour and imperious hauteur of her younger sister, Princess Margaret Rose, was out in public for all to see: Margaret lived in perpetual jealousy of Elizabeth's role as Queen, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">and her antics were designed to embarrass the reign.</a> Elizabeth is said to have felt like the dowdy and plain one next to her sister, a woman who regularly figured in lists of the world's most beautiful women and who was known for her grand living. While Margaret had some love and affection for her sister, she pushed the boundaries of acceptable behaviour and caused Elizabeth constant dread and embarrassment: her affairs were legion, not especially discreet, and included Peter Sellers and (according to legend) Mick Jagger, among many others. As the sisters entered middle age, however, Elizabeth asserted greater control as Margaret's looks faded and died; lacking the looks to keep rich lovers, Margaret now depended on her sister's dole and had to toe the Windsor party line — effectively, the Queen was taking her revenge for the put-downs and exquisite embarrassments of earlier years.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanFontaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanFontaine">Joan Fontaine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaDeHavilland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaDeHavilland">Olivia de Havilland</a>. One of the most famous feuds in Old Hollywood, and was STILL ongoing at this entry's original inclusion in 2012. By the time of Joan's death in 2013<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3aw3v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3aw3v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3aw3v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ironically, Joan had joked that if she were to die first, Olivia would probably be annoyed because she'd beaten her at something</span>, both sisters were just a little under 100 and hadn't spoken to each other in 30 years. The rivalry was all the more intense because both of them were A-list actresses back in the day, each winning Oscars for Best Actress. Rivalry compounded by the fact Joan had been <em>forbidden</em> by her parents to use her family name for acting — she had to settle for "Fontaine".
<div class="indent"><strong>Olivia</strong>: Imagine what we could have done if we had gotten together. We could have selected the right scripts, the right directors, the right producers — we could have built our own empire. But it was not to be.
