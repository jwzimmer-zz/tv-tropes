<div class="acaptionright" style="width:350px;">The nostalgia goggles you get today are crap; they were <em>so</em> much better back in <em>my</em> day.</div>
<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"Even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit. That the imagination of man is capable of creating the myth of a more open, more generous time is not a sign of our folly."</em>

</p><p>There are many causes for this. First, people's tastes are generally based on the art they knew as they grew up, and they continue to inform themselves on this basis. This is especially problematic when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> comes into play: Modern day art (be it music, film, television, etc.) may positively depict contemporary societal norms and developments that would have been frowned on when you were growing up. Second, tastes can refine or limit as one ages; what may have seemed brilliant to a child or teen would seem crude or laughable to most adults, but the memories of how great something from one's youth seemed to linger long afterward, making the familiar examples seem better than more or less equivalent modern ones in comparison. Third, change in most art forms comes in waves, rather than developing continuously, and the transition from one wave to another can be jarring and unfamiliar — while the periods between waves tend to be uninspired across the board.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Another possible important cause of this nostalgia is a consequence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">Sturgeon's Law</a> combined with the passage of time: As new material is released, the vast majority will be of mediocre or worse quality, but over time, a powerful selection pressure causes all but the best material (and in some infamous cases, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">worst</a>) to be rapidly forgotten, leaving an increasingly inaccurate impression of the overall quality of the genre over time. This is known as "the nostalgia filter", and can be easily demonstrated by a careful review of the period works that are <em>not</em> remembered today. The distance of time also compresses the memories of past eras, causing the best work to seem more continuous than it was, whereas "new" is a continually moving frontier: between this memory compression and the selective memories of "the good stuff", the past of the genre is remembered as a time when "it all was good".
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The most impressionable time is during pre-adolescent, adolescent, and teenage years (with the absolute latest being the twentysomething years). These are the years where one is young and undistracted (or less distracted in the case of twentysomethings) by the full responsibilities of adulthood and the burdens of getting older. For boys, this may also be the time before they discovered girls or sex. Apart from schoolwork, they simply could afford time to absorb the pop culture or cult genre of the time, be it film, music, video games, or TV shows, and give it more attention, allowing it to ingrain itself on the senses, thus influencing one's tastes for the rest of their life.
</p><p>One final possible reason: most developers/authors/artists/musicians/etc. create whatever is popular at that day and age. This means that what was popular last year isn't being produced in the same density. If a person's preference is for something that is out of fashion right now, they may have little choice besides 'hang onto the older version' or 'give up on it completely'.
</p><p>Of course, this is certainly not to imply that newer is automatically better or that the Nostalgia Filter applies to every single case; just because a person prefers an older work to more modern things doesn't mean they only like it because of nostalgia. Sometimes the older work <em>is</em> better, or at least has its own appeal that the present things don't — even beyond "Charm", which is often thrown around to describe stuff mostly to just mean "It's nostalgic".
</p><p>Sam Viviano, art director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD">MAD</a></em>, has a saying which defines the Nostalgia Filter: "<em>MAD</em> was at its best whenever you first started reading it." A corollary to that is that, if you didn't like <em>MAD</em>, it was at its best shortly <em>before</em> you started reading it.
</p><p>You'll notice that this trope sometimes overlaps with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryHatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryHatedom">Periphery Hatedom</a>. Almost always, when people complain about how new stuff sucks, they bring up examples of things which were marketed towards the youth of their own generation as examples of "good" or even "classic" works in the genre. Never mind that 20 years ago, when it was being marketed towards them, many of the adults back then were saying the <em>exact same thing</em> we are today. It's a neverending cycle. This trope also frequently overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureLoser">Future Loser</a>, where the individual (consciously or not) feels <em>his own life</em> was better in those days than it is now.
</p><p>It most importantly must be mentioned that <em>not every adult uncontrollably succumbs to this.</em> While adults abusing the Nostalgia Filter has become a bit of a cliché (particularly in media aimed at teens and/or preteens), there are <em>many</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> adults (of various ages) who enjoy both old and new media in equal measures. This is especially true for those who are socially active and hang around a diverse group of people. How many real people subscribe to it is highly debatable. However, one thing is for certain: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Those who abuse it or abuse the concept of it tend to be very vocal about it.</a>

<ul><li> The four audiobook volumes of <em>The Alan Cross Guide to Alternative Rock</em>, based on the author's radio series <em>The Ongoing History of New Music</em>, appear guilty of this: most of the bands are from the 1980s or early 1990s, several are from the 1960s and 1970s, and the ones from the 2000s that are covered are treated briefly. Cross, a history major, averts this by noting it's far easier to objectively measure the cultural impact of older artists, while for most newer artists it's too soon to tell if they'll be influential.

It has been noted that this has a certain similarity to frequent fan-criticisms of the current DC Universe.

He fondly recalls a New Years teen party that we see from Phineas's perspective - everyone converges at his parents' house over his objections, people get stupid drunk, he and Franklin get beaten up by hoods who crash the party, and the house and family car end up destroyed just before the parents get home.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, there's a scene in the 1480s, where the immortal Hob Gadling, now about 130 or so, overhears an old man complaining about these newfangled chimneys, and reminiscing about the days when "we did have a good honest brazier in the house," when nobody suffered from "rheumes and cattarhs" and the smoke was "good medicine for the man and his family." Hob mutters to Dream about how foolish the old man is, and how back then everyone was coughing and wheezing from the smoke, and occasionally you'd find whole families that had asphyxiated in the night. In the book's final volume (wherein he's <em>several</em> hundred years old) he attacks people nostalgic for times when they weren't even alive by criticizing the very <em>concept</em> of a Renaissance Faire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a> #1</em> has a middle aged man moping about how the music in the present is nowhere near as good as the music in his day (i.e. the second half of the 1970s).

</li><li> Played with in the "Talisman" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Finder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Finder">Finder</a></em>. Marcie Grosvenor spends years trying to find a children's book that her mother's on-off boyfriend read to her regularly when she was a little girl. When she eventually finds it she discovers that it's complete rubbish... and then she realises that it's not just Nostalgia Filter, it's that the guy who read it to her, who came from a culture which placed great value on oration and oral storytelling, was improvising almost everything and using the book simply to get prompts from. She ends up feeling oddly betrayed by him over this.

Roger gets upset that her choice is "Captain Goofball", a comic he loved when he was younger, but Andy proves her point by bringing out an entire month's worth of strips and showing that the comic hasn't been funny in a long time. She argues that they should give the kids reading the comics today the chance to find a strip that means as much to them as "Goofball" meant to Roger, but he still ends the storyline saddened by the loss.
<ul><li> Also done unintentionally with the Steve Jobs tribute comic, where Jason wistfully pulls the family's iFruit out of storage. Long-time readers may recall that when they first got the iFruit, Jason outright despised it and took a very long time to warm up to it (though author Bill Amend was a Mac fan from Day One).

The story features Gil, a writer played by Owen Wilson, who is writing a novel about a man that runs a nostalgia shop, and the writer himself has a nostalgic view of the 1920s in Paris as a sort of Golden Age, something that his fiancée and her family constantly rag on him for. Eventually, Gil discovers a mysterious taxi cab that arrives every night at midnight and transports him back to a nostalgia-filtered 1920s Paris, where he meets many famous authors and falls in love with Adriana, a woman who is at the time Picasso's mistress. As time goes on, the writer discovers that Adriana has feelings for him too and decides to live in the 1920s with her.

The whole idea revolves around the main character, Alex, trying to pretend to his mother (who was in a coma and missed the fall of the Berlin Wall) that Communism still exists and there is no re-unification process going on, to the point of creating fake news broadcasts and putting capitalist products in old-style communist-brand packaging. Many of the older supporting characters (who have ended up losing their jobs and security) find the environment to be something of a refuge from the changes happening around them, and Alex himself begins to become almost nostalgic, not necessarily for the real East Germany (he is seen protesting in the beginning of the film) but for the country that could have been, and the ideals it claimed to represent. The film itself is careful to show the good and bad sides of both capitalism and communism (or at least, the former's absurdity).

<div class="indent">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way — in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
</div></li><li> Perhaps the uber-archetype <em>The Idylls of Theocritus</em> paints a vivid scene of a shepherd and a goatherd meeting at noon to compliment each other on their pan flute playing. The whole genre invites readers to meditate on a 'golden' past which feels better then one's present, usually, corrupt urban or courtly real world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> there is an in-universe example: at the end of the series, Marco sees the years he spent fighting Yeerks as the "good old days". He remembers life-and-death battles as "cool, rock 'em sock 'em battles". He doesn't really seem to remember how much they scared the crap out of him at the time. But then, it's said that Marco has a much easier time adjusting to civilian life than the others, because he doesn't feel guilty about the things he's done.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOutlaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOutlaws">The Outlaws</a></em> shows conservative political groups and certain Freikorps fighters, especially officers, trying to bring the good old German Empire back. The younger generation, including the hero, aims at a nationalist revolution and radical change of Germany, although in a different way than the moderate Left and the Communists.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatyricon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatyricon">The Satyricon</a></em>, published some time in the 1st century AD (and in the very, very strange <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FelliniSatyricon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FelliniSatyricon">Fellini movie</a>), the poet Agamemnon complains about the failing quality of contemporary literature and poetry, compared to the good old days, making this at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>.

</div><ul><li> The epigraph from Chapter II of that story sums it up neatly:
<div class="indent">When I was a fighting-man, the kettle-drums they beat, <br/>The people scattered gold-dust before my horse's feet; <br/>But now I am a great king, the people hound my track <br/>With poison in my wine-cup, and daggers at my back.

<ul><li> This and the example from the <em>Satyricon</em> above are examples of this as applied to the field of linguistics. Language was always at its best when your grandparents were speaking it.

Even though he's well aware of what working conditions are like for ordinary people, and his reason for returning was to escape from corrupt policemen who have not heard of Miranda rights...

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheExtinctionParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheExtinctionParade">The Extinction Parade</a></em>, the narrator describes <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayan_Emergency">the Emergency<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_May_incident_(Malaysia)">1969 race riots<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Malaysia through such a lens. They sucked for humans, obviously, but for vampires like her and Laila, they were a buffet, as the backdrop of war and civil unrest made it easy to get away with murder.

Almost prophetic...
</li><li> Scottish comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankieBoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankieBoyle">Frankie Boyle</a> criticized this approach in his autobiography, <em>My Shit Life so Far</em>:

</li><li> Defied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot">Hercule Poirot</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Curtain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Curtain">Curtain</a></em>. When he reunites with his old friend, Hastings, the latter began to reminisce about the good times of his youth, until Poirot reminded him that the old times weren't as all good and jolly as Hastings remembered it to be.
<div class="indent"><strong>Poirot:</strong> But indeed, my friend, you were not so happy as you think. You had recently been severely wounded, you were fretting at being no longer fit for active service, you had just been depressed beyond words by your sojourn in a dreary convalescent home, and as far as I remember, you proceeded to complicate matters by falling in love with two women at the same time.
</div></li><li> Definitively summed up in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">The Last Continent</a></em>. Ponder Stibbons knows that the answer to any suggestion of his will be You dont get proper fill-in-nouns these days—remember old nickname ancient-wizard-who-died-fifty-years-ago-who-Ponder-wouldnt-possibly-be-able-to-remember? Now <em>there</em> was a chap who knew his fill-in-nouns.
</li><li> This is pretty much the entire novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ComingUpForAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ComingUpForAir">Coming Up For Air</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BestServedCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BestServedCold">Best Served Cold</a></em>: Discussed. When a notary claims that "mercenaries aren't like they used to be," the mercenary Nicomo Cosca counters that it's only natural for people to mistake the past as better than the present because they were younger and more idealistic. Some people get better and others get worse, but the world stays the same.
</li><li> In his book <em>How Music Works: The Science and Psychology of Beautiful Sounds, from Beethoven to the Beatles and Beyond</em>, composer John Powell (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragon">How to Train Your Dragon</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenRun">Chicken Run</a></em>, etc.) puts down the idea that vinyl/record music somehow sounds better than CDs almost entirely to this, stating that "Much of the CD/vinyl debate can probably be attributed to technology nostalgia, which dates back to cave-dwellers having heated arguments about the superiority of bronze arrow heads compared with the newfangled iron ones." He points to a study of 160 enthusiasts of either CDs or vinyl, in which only 4 could accurately and reliably identify which they were listening to. He notes that with this study having been done back in 1993 (the book was published in 2010), further improvements in technology have made it even more impossible to tell the difference.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CastleHangnail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CastleHangnail">Castle Hangnail</a></em>, the ghost Edward remarks that modern politics, with its Prime Ministers and Parliamentarians, isn't as good as it was back when he was alive, when you got rulers like Mad King Harold, who believed he was a cuttlefish and tried to wage a war on the clouds. He stands by this even after Majordomo reminds him that it was Mad King Harold who cut Edward's head off.
</li><li> Robert Heinlein's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeEnoughForLove">Time Enough for Love</a></em> literally dives headlong into this one, as it's the story of Lazarus Long, the oldest member of the human race, telling stories to "youngsters" attempting to convince him to get another rejuvenation treatment instead of letting his body die. While he flirts with it during his stories of being enslaved, of begging for money until he could become a priest of a religion he didn't believe in, of almost dying in the wilderness countless times, it isn't until the latter part of the book that he gets the opportunity to literally go back to the past - back to the 1910s, when he was a small child. He's giddy as can be as he enjoys his time in a world of casual bigotry and judgementalism... and then gets his ass shot off fighting in the trenches during World War I. This being Lazarus Long, he got better.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em>, a common theme is various gangsters missing the good old days, when the Mafia had more power, men were more honorable and acted like "the strong, silent type". The flashbacks we see make it clear that men like Johnny Boy and Junior were as bad, probably worse, than the current generation.
</li><li> The opening theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em> has Archie and Edith singing about how ideal their childhood was. Thing is, they both grew up during the Great Depression.
</li><li> Several American sitcoms are set in a rose colored idea of two decades ago: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em> was a 1970s sitcoms about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWonderYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWonderYears">The Wonder Years</a></em> a 1980s sitcom about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em> a 1990s sitcom about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>. These shows concentrate more on the fashions and pop culture of those decades than on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> problems that were current then. <br/><br/><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em> is something of a subversion. While the other series showed life in those past eras as simpler and with more innocence (to a degree), <em>That '70s Show</em> highlighted youthful rebellion, job loss, divorce and other such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">delightful</a> topics. Unlike the other sitcoms, which implied some things but showed us nothing, <em>That '70s Show</em> openly stated that the teens were having sex, drinking and smoking pot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AuctionKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AuctionKings">Auction Kings</a></em>, Paul loves the 1980s. Jon loves old toys.

After interviewing several people from each of the periods (along with footage featuring pundits such as Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, and Bill O'Reilly) grew up in which they discuss how things weren't really that great, John Oliver comes to the "realization" that the reason these pundits constantly look back to these times as happier and less complicated times is because those were the periods when they were children, and the world generally seems happier and less complicated when you're a child.

Furthermore, Time Lords in particular refer to the upper class rather than the entire Gallifreyan race in certain contexts. Other times, The Doctor does seem to miss more Gallifrey itself at time.
</li><li> A common story on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FantasyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FantasyIsland">Fantasy Island</a></em> is a guest wanting to relive a period in history they have romanticized.

The song begins with a picturesque homecoming, obviously after a long time away, with a man stepping off a train and being welcomed by his family and his girlfriend, Mary ("hair of gold and lips like cherry"). The young man walks through his hometown, and it hasn't changed a bit ... even the old oak tree he used to play on is still there, majestic in its glory. It sounds too good to be true ... because it is. The scene suddenly takes a dark turn as the man awakens from what's to be his final night in bed ... he was only dreaming, and he's staring at four dank, dark gray walls. He's in prison, presumably a prisoner of war and awaiting execution at dawn ("For there's a guard, and there's a sad old padre/Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak"). That he'll be laid to rest beneath that green, green grass of home gives him little comfort in his final hours.
</li><li> "20 Years Ago" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers">Kenny Rogers</a>, who reflects on a simpler time  the mid-1960s  in his 1987 hit, noting about good times at the drugstore counter and the now-recently closed movie house, and noting that an ordinary dime had lots of buying power. However, the nostalgia is tinged with bitterness and darkness, particularly as he reflects on the death of a close high school friend who was killed in action in Vietnam.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStatlerBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStatlerBrothers">The Statler Brothers</a> found great success with a number of songs reflecting on old times, sometimes fun — "Do You Remember These," a 1972 top 5 hit reflecting on popular culture from the late 1930s through the end of the 1950s; and "The Movies," a 1977 country hit that was a roll call of all the great movies from the earliest days to the then-present — and sometimes bittersweet, most notably "Class of '57."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerleHaggard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerleHaggard">Merle Haggard</a>: For as many songs he recorded that bitterly recalled certain memories, the "Okie from Muskogee" recorded many songs that recalled good times. Some examples:
<ul><li> "Okie From Muskogee": A 1969 song paying homage to small-town life, where conservative values were the norm and outsiders with ideals contrary to the established way of life  e.g., patriotic values, with residents not using drugs, adopting hippie lifestyles, attempt to dodge the draft or challenge authority - were considered just that ... "outsiders."
</li><li> "The Roots of My Raising" and "The Way It Was in '51": A two-sided hit from 1976 which played upon the values of home and growing up in a carefree era. "The Roots of My Raising," about a young man who visits home for the first time in several years, reflects on such childhood memories as the one-room schoolhouse, the homestead, father and bankers who had absolute faith in their customers' ability to repay loans. "The Way it Was in '51," which became a minor hit of its own in 1978 (and still gets classic country airplay today as a "B"-side) spoke about a now middle-aged man's teenage years, before rock music and Interstate highways, when camaraderie was found amongst small town residents and neighbors and Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell were unquestionably the most popular singers of the day. "The Way it Was in '51" made a reference to the Korean War, and the line "servicemen were proud of what they'd done" was perhaps a sly reference to the Vietnam War, where not all veterans were "proud" of their service and they were shunned when they got back.
</li></ul></li><li> The song "I used to love H.E.R" by Common just reeks of this trope. In this case Common is reminiscing about how Hip-hop changed with the times, but at a certain point it's clear he feels saddened by what it eventually became.
</li><li> The Futureheads song "Christmas Was Better in the 80s".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobSeger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobSeger">Bob Seger</a> basically built his career on nostalgia, with songs like "Old Time Rock and Roll" and "Night Moves".
<ul><li> And "Against the Wind" and "Like a Rock" and "Still the Same" and "Main Street." Pretty much every song is about how awesome things were when Seger was younger.
</li></ul></li><li> "Summer of '69" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BryanAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BryanAdams">Bryan Adams</a> could be considered to use this in response to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays">Glory Days</a> trope, though it doesn't look back at 1969 as much, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">never mind the sexually position of the same name</a>, done in that wonderful summer.

The band realised this and have based the subsequent part of their career around 'getting back to their hardcore roots', specifically their first two EPs and first album. They like to remind people of this with playing their first two EPs live in order, calling the four songs recorded for their best of 'an EP's worth of new songs', bringing back screamed vocals, releasing an independent EP called <em>The Young and Defenseless</em>, of which two songs went on the album and two didn't (mirroring their EP <em>Four Ways to Scream Your Name</em>). Their album <em>Conduit</em> is a return to the hardcore roots they had before they even recorded an EP. Despite this, some fans still say they aren't as good as those early works, even though they've produced many songs in that style since.
</li><li> SR-71's song "1985", made famous by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup">Bowling for Soup</a> cover is about this.

</li><li> "Back in the Day" by Ahmad, a hip-hop song that's filled with syrupy nostalgia. It's arguably the poster child for nostalgia in the hip-hop community, along with songs like "T.R.O.Y." by Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth, and "Passin Me By" by Pharcyde.

Despite being sentimental, they are also comical since they basically depict the children as having all kinds of hijinks and misbehaving.
</li><li> "Those Were The Days" by Mary Hopkin is a nostalgic song about the joys of the past. It was released during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, but is ironically often used in nostalgic TV shows about the 1960s, even though it originally didn't reflect on that time period.
</li><li> "As Time Goes By", made famous by the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca">Casablanca</a></em> looks back on the memories of a love from long ago.
</li><li> "Things We Said Today" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AHardDaysNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AHardDaysNight">A Hard Day's Night</a></em> and "In My Life" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RubberSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RubberSoul">Rubber Soul</a></em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> songs who are both an example as well as an subversion. They look nostalgically back at now from the viewpoint of the future.
</li><li> "We'll Meet Again" by Vera Lynn has become extremely nostalgic for people who went through World War Two in Great Britain. It's united the country in a way that was so powerful that virtually every World War Two film or series set in Great Britain has to resist the tendency to use it, because it has become such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a>. Which is odd considering that the time period looked back on was when Britain was bombed by German airplanes and people had to tighten their belts because of rationing. Now, it's mostly known ala <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>.
</li><li> "Mon Enfance" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacquesBrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacquesBrel">Jacques Brel</a> looks back at his childhood and how the illusions were destroyed by World War Two. "Rosa Rosa Rosa" is a more playful song about his school days as a young boy.
<ul><li> Same title, different song "Mon Enfance" by Barbara, is about her revisiting the house where she grew up as a kid and her ambivalent feelings about it, including the text "the war threw us out there, we lived as outlaws and I loved that, when I think about it...", and by the end stating that the memories from the childhood are the worst, because they hurt us.

</li><li> "Play Dough!" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAquabats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAquabats">The Aquabats!</a> is about a nerd reminiscing on the carefree days of his childhood.
</li><li> German hit from 2013/2014, "Lieder" from Adel Tawil, is a trip down memory lane to all the music that was important to him becoming what he was. Most pieces of music referenced are from the '80s, though references stretch from the 1850s to quite recent pieces.
</li><li> The song "Früher war alles besser" by German mittelalter band Saltatio Mortis mocks this trope. It starts out seeming like another song reminiscing about the good old days, when everyone could find a job and the banks weren't corrupt, but the chorus tells everyone to stop thinking in such a way. It even outright calls anyone who believes in the 'good old days' an idiot. The claims about how things were better in the past get progressively more ridiculous as the song goes on, getting to the point where it's claimed that back then, the ice never melted in your drink.

</li><li> "These Are the Days of Our Lives" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> puts a more positive spin on the trope: the old days were great, but hey, the present is pretty good too.

As they track the trends and styles that rose and fell over the decade, they freely admit that for all the movies that have aged well — famous hits, ones that were big in the day but have <em>not</em> entered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">Small Reference Pools</a>, and ones that just flew under the radar — there are plenty that haven't (they've noted more than once that they're dreading having to revisit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em>, and have a grudge against most of the teen sex comedies of the era for their morally abhorrent lead characters and alarming treatment of women), and take the time to put their success or lack thereof into the larger socio-political context of the decade.

Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked." Toward the end of her column she added, "Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth."

In that particular review, Troy outright states that he felt "nostalgic glee" in reviewing the classic books, and that, while he does hate a few of them, he loved them as a child and used that love to prevent his reviews from being too cruel. In fact, he even explains that part of the reason the <em>2000</em> reviews got progressively meaner is because he didn't read them as a kid and didn't develop the same appreciation for them.
<div class="indent"><strong>Troy:</strong> I kind of feel like all of the nostalgic glee that used to fuel my earlier entries has been replaced with easy tomato-lobbing — I didn't read these more recent books when I was a kid, it's hard for me to figure the appeal this new series has for anyone, and thus making fun of something that obviously sucks seems like something less than a challenge.

Bob is <em>not</em> a fan of the latter decade, frequently accompanying mentions of it with a stock photo of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWrestler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWrestler">Randy "The Ram" Robinson</a> with the caption "The '90s sucked", and he has little love for most of the pop culture trends of that era (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">Nineties anti heroes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernism">post-modern</a> teen horror, et cetera). On the other hand, he loves the '80s, cheesiness and all. He states that this was because the '90s were his awkward, schlubby teen years that came in between his wondrous childhood in the '80s and his present-day success as an internet personality.
</li><li> Bob later <a class="urllink" href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/6962-The-90s-Didnt-Suck">re-examined<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> his original view of both the political and pop culture attitudes of the 90s. While admitting 90s did have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">good</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">stuff</a>, Bob considered the time to be a cultural dead zone with no real identity outside of references to previous eras like the 70s and 50s. He finds the answer to this in Francis Fukuyama's famous treatise <em>The End of History</em>, stating that the West's victory in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> had produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeAreBummedCommunismFell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeAreBummedCommunismFell">a sort of ennui</a> that, in turn, produced a culture of nostalgia and introspection. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">9/11</a>, of course, quickly shattered that culture.
</li><li> Averted, and examined, with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/5140-The-Simpsons-Is-Still-Funny-Pt-1">his treatment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. While going over the older seasons, Bob noticed that most of the episodes he thought were comic gold as a kid didn't age well, while the episodes he thought were boring when they first aired became much better now that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">old enough to appreciate the humor</a>. He concludes that <em>The Simpsons</em> didn't jump the shark like its fans thought it did, but rather, its fans grew up and their tastes in humor changed, and the show didn't change with them. Plus, there's the fact that the show, a broad satire of the greater pop culture, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">a relic</a> of a time stretching from roughly 1950-2000 when pop culture was largely monolithic<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1x83l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1x83l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1x83l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As in, most mainstream Americans, apart from those on the cultural fringes, watched the same three or four TV <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Networks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Networks">networks</a> and the same movies, received the same news, listened to the same music, read the same books, et cetera.</span>  the early '00s, the time most commonly cited as when <em>The Simpsons</em> "stopped being funny", is also the time when the internet and cable television fragmented pop culture into a million little shards and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Subcultures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Subcultures">subcultures</a>. <br/><br/>When he <a class="urllink" href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/moviesandtv/columns/highdefinition/12188-The-Simpson-s-Maude-Flanders-Isn-t-as-Good-as-She-Seems">revisited the show<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FXNetworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FXNetworks">FXX</a>'s marathon of every episode in 2014, not only did it reinforce his opinion that this trope was in full effect on the earlier seasons, it also caused him to notice a microcosm of this trope in how Maude Flanders was portrayed. After she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned">killed off</a>, both the characters on the show and many viewers came to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">remember Maude as a paragon of saintliness</a>, yet as Bob watched the old episodes she was in, he mostly saw her acting judgmental, acidic, and catty, to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">he couldn't wait for her to be killed off</a>.

He was surprised to learn that they made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf">TV adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenWolf">Teen Wolf</a></em> (<em>Truth or Dare</em> starred one of that show's lead actors, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPosey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPosey">Tyler Posey</a>), a movie that he thought sucked, and used that film as proof that younger generations shouldn't always listen to people like him when they tell them that everything made in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> was golden.
</li><li> In the <em>Big Picture</em> episode <a class="urllink" href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2019/07/08/familiar-things-stranger-things-uses-nostalgia-preserve-history/">"Familiar Things"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he discusses how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em> makes use of '80s nostalgia and how much of the discourse surrounding it concerns whether or not pop culture as a whole is too obsessed with the past. He notes that the nostalgia cycles for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> have gone on for far longer than people ever expected they would, and attributes this to the fact that the great pop culture trends of the 21st century, unlike their analog-era predecessors, never fully went away, citing how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> were still thriving over twenty years after their respective debuts even though they were both old enough to be nostalgic. He also discusses how a lot of the '80s pop culture that inspired <em>Stranger Things</em> was itself inspired by nostalgia for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, with the Baby Boomers of that decade being the first generation to turn nostalgia into an industry — and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplainExplainOhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplainExplainOhCrap">promptly has an "oh dear God" reaction</a> at the thought that, in twenty years, there will be nostalgia for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>.

Oddly enough, he attributes this to a desire by many Gen-Xers to seem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">older and more worldly</a>, noting how many of the heroes of '90s teen culture were twentysomethings like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Dante Hicks</a> who felt like they'd already turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan">grumpy old men</a>.

<ul><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> features a CIA holodeck machine that scans the memories of people and projects them into the holodeck. The machine has a literal nostalgia filter. When Stan revisits his childhood with the filter on, it's bright, warm, comforting, and his dad is a nice person. Turned off, the place is a dump and his father is cruel, as it really was (not that Stan is bothered by it).

BoJack Horseman perception and remembrance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">the '90s</a> does involve a few embellishments, often being held by BoJack as the peak of his career and life. However, as the first season begins and progresses, it becomes all too clear that even then, he was far from happy, stable and mature; something that has carried on toward his middle age in the present with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisOwnWorstEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisOwnWorstEnemy">the problem of it</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin">all being something within himself.</a> As of the end of season 2, his rose tinted version of this early part of his life has been shattered as well, with BoJack realizing that his young adulthood was in some part self-denial at his increasingly clear issues. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It only get worse in season 3 when Sarah Lynn's death and the misfortunes he faces forever taint his memory of the show, to the point of running out of the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Ethan Around</a></em> after one of his co-stars mentions how she wants to be famous, reminding him of Sarah Lynn's destroyed life.</span>

In the episode "Back to School", Cat is looking forward to attending his high school reunion and dancing with his old crush Sally. He describes himself as popular and having a great time in high school. Even in the beginning of the episode something is fishy, with all of the memorabilia and rewards he claimed were his really belonging to Dog, and their diploma having Dog's name but not Cat's. He tells Dog that they need to correct it by visiting their old high school. The brothers visit Rancid the school principal about the diploma, and it is revealed Cat never attended the last day of school so for him to have the diploma and be able to attend the reunion dance, he must go back to school for one day. Cat is happy to relive his glory days, but wonders why he can't remember his last day at school. But throughout the day things just keep going wrong with him while Dog is popular - three of Cat's new classmates are the relatives of the Greasers who make him miserable, his crush Sally is indifferent to him, and after class when he asks her to dance with him at the reunion, she coldly tells him that she has a boyfriend and makes it clear that she does not like him. At lunch both the cool kids and nerds refuse to let Cat sit with them, and then a food fight break out and Cat gets blamed for it. Finally at gym he is humiliated by Cliff, who is the teacher and Sally's boyfriend, who brings Sally there to watch his humiliation. As the kids laugh at Cat and call him a loser, his repressed memories come back and he realize the truth - Cat was an outcast and all of his positive memories of school were Dog's, and at the last day of school he was humiliated at gym by Cliff's father Coach Feltbottom, the gym teacher at the time, where he and all the other kids call him a loser, which made Cat run away and block out his memory of the day. And because Cat blocked out his memory of that day and chose to remember things differently, he set himself up for more humiliation in this episode.
