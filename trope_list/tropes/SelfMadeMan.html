The few advantages that they possessed are disproportionate to the scale of their achievements; the principal cause of the latter being their own skills, talent, and merit. Be it through hard work, dedication, commitment to their work, a little cunning, some business acumen, and a dollop of serendipity, they have gone from unimportant to important. This is usually who you get at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">Rags to Riches</a>, but this is not that trope because the Self-Made Man is often there right at the start of the story, whereas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">Rags to Riches</a> follows the course that leads a character here.
</p><p>Often the conflict of this kind of story revolves on societal acceptance and reputation. Typically, in works set further back in history, they are looked down on as upstarts, a reflection of the dislike a lot of the nobility had for the power shift following the Industrial Revolution. In more modern settings they might be respected to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a>, basing their ascent on how they had to climb the ladder from the bottom. In other kinds of stories, the story have characters looking back on the process by which they made themselves, wondering if the rest of their lives are going to be as exciting and adventurous, or if what they built and sustained can last, or if it has any meaning in wider society and history beyond their own personal success. Expect them to show fewer social graces but often more political savvy than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMoney">the more traditionally wealthy</a>, except when he is feverishly trying to imitate and become socially accepted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueBlood">Blue Bloods</a>, when he generally comes off the worse. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">Impoverished Patrician</a> is often to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a>, or his daughter (or any situation where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobilityMarriesMoney">Nobility Marries Money</a>), though it also is possible that his rise was because he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnableToSupportAWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnableToSupportAWife">Unable to Support a Wife</a>, and she did indeed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou">Wait For Him</a>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassedOverInheritance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassedOverInheritance">Passed-Over Inheritance</a>, the will-making character is often this trope, because refusing your children the inheritance you got comes across as petty.

In the case of artists, novels like Bildungsroman and Kunstlerroman often serve as a coming-of-age story for how people make themselves into these kinds of individuals. In the case of scientists, it deals with the times they spent until they found the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a>. A Self-Made Man can appear as a protagonist, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a>, a hero or anti-hero. They can also be supporting-characters, where <em>their</em> interesting plot is mostly over and at times serves as backstory or foundation in which one can mine for dramatic gold, guilt, baggage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays">Glory Days</a>. A less positive spin on this trope is the stereotypically boorish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche">Nouveau Riche</a>. As this character tends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefaultToGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefaultToGood">Default to Good</a>, it can be seen as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>. A second variant of this trope is that of a character who, for whatever reason, chooses to change their basic nature in defiance of normal expectations of what they are "meant" to be or are likely to become — a naturally selfish or evil-inclined character, for example, forcing himself moment-to-moment to act generous or good because he has decided to make himself that way. This archetype is similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">Übermensch</a>. They might be the middle generation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeSuccessfulGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeSuccessfulGenerations">Three Successful Generations</a>. What is necessary for self-made also differs. Doing well after graduating at the top of your cause and maintaining high academic standing (all of them being markers of merit) is somehow not as remarkable as achieving something without going to university, either by being self-taught or being a "savant".

Indeed the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverASelfMadeWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverASelfMadeWoman">Never a Self-Made Woman</a>, explains how successful women have historically had their achievements tied to connections with men, who had to make it possible for them. This is more how the trope is portrayed than it is in reality since there are indeed quite a number of women whose achievements are no more over-advantaged than that of men. And of course what seems self-made in one era and context changes from another.

Not to be confused for the book by Norah Vincent, a chronicle of immersive journalism in which she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">passes for a man</a> for more than a year.

Regrettably, he just about broke himself in the process, becoming nearly as bad as his father. If what his father says is to be believed, he too was an example of this.
</li><li> Priest Seto (whom Kaiba is a reincarnation of) was also an example, who managed to work himself up from humble beginnings to becoming a member of the Pharaoh's court. While he was technically a member of the royal family (and was eventually crowned Pharaoh himself), the only one who actually knew that had nothing to do with his ascension.
</li><li> Katsuya Jonouchi/Joey Wheeler of the same show is an unusual example. Starting out with a mediocre Duel Monsters deck and a smattering of chance cards, Jonouchi enters one tournament after another and with a combination of skill, luck, and being thoroughly underestimated by his opponents, manages to be a success. Flashforward five seasons—he's been the runner-up at Duelist Kingdom, a finalist at Battle City, and is the third-ranked duelist on the planet. Interestingly, Kaiba and he <em>hate</em> each other.

<ul><li> Jack Atlas started as a rat from Satellite. But once he had a chance to escape from there, he became the King of Duelists not shortly after. However, this is subverted much later, as it is revealed that Goodwin and Yeager paid strong duelists to lose against Jack on purpose when Jack's career began.
</li><li> It is revealed that Rex Goodwin himself was the Legendary D-Wheeler from Satellite. Somehow he managed to become the CEO of Public Security of Maintance Bureau and Neo-Domino City's most famous man.

Everything started when a single card, that was probably discarded as a trash card by someone from the Tops, fell from the sky and a very young Jack found it. Years later, the boy from the Commons became the man who won the Friendship Cup and earned the title of King, being the hero of the entire City.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a> is a moderate example. Her parents were always well-off, a pair of respected and successful doctors who were themselves descended from successful professionals, but they were solidly in the yeoman social class and never had the money to really be "rich." Honor herself earned her first several million dollars with prize money from ships she seized for smuggling during her stationing in the Basilisk system, then reinvested the modest fortune into numerous investment opportunities around Manticore; the proceeds from her investments turned her from millionaire into a <em>billion</em>aire. She then founded Grayson Skydomes, Ltd. on the planet Grayson, bankrolled by her off-world fortune, the proceeds of which made her the wealthiest individual on Grayson and in shouting distance of the wealthy on Manticore. Throughout the novels, her fortune continued to expand through regular reinvestment in the many financial opportunities a sustained war provides anybody with capital and resources, along the way also earning a knighthood, a Duchy on Gryphon and investment as a Steadholder on Grayson. The later books have her as one of the most important figures, exonomically, politically and militarily, in the entire galaxy. However, all along the way Honor is quick to point out that her financial success is primarily the doing of her hired financial consultant, and she was always quick to deflect any praise or reward from her personal actions.

However, there are a few exceptions:
<ul><li> Varys had nothing, even less than Littlefinger, who was at least a minor noble, being born as a slave and prisoner. After he was castrated and thrown into the slums of the Free Cities, he became a pocket thief and whore. There, he learned to extract secrets from his clients.

He then moved up the ranks of the Second Sons, eventually becoming their leader and becomes the right-hand man to the Mother of Dragons. He also believes he'll return to nothing, and seems pretty okay with it.
</li><li> Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish is born into the very lowest ranks of nobility, with holdings barely worth mentioning and being seen as the son of an upjumped merchant by the ruling class, but parlays his twin talents of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">manipulation</a> and money-lending until he's playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">cyvasse</a> with kings and queens as pawns.
</li><li> Xaro Xoan Daxos was a poor immigrant from the Summer Isles when he arrived in Qarth but became a member of the ruling Thirteen.
</li><li> Daenerys Targaryen went from abused child to independent woman; from glorified sex slave to fully-realized Khaleesi; from penniless widow to commander of eight thousand elite soldiers and liberator of over two hundred thousand slaves. She remarks that she did the last two things in only a <em>fortnight</em>.

He confesses to Will that, for all his Self-Made Man rhetoric, he didn't have it that rough since his parents were always there for him.

Born Andrei Rianofski in Russia, his family fled the persecution and violence of the Russian revolution. He soon rose to power and wealth through a series of investments. As an adult, he used his personal history of having pulled himself up by his own bootstraps to argue against the idea of unions, taxes, and anything that could benefit the public welfare (if they want better working conditions, they should work to become rich like him). Eventually, he founds his own underwater city to avoid having to pay dues to an overseeing governmental body, claiming that the new city would operate as a meritocracy where anyone could acquire wealth. Needless to say, Ryan's lack of compassion for his (effectively captive) city's populace goes badly when they're deprived of basic human rights and resources...

Despite the invention being a success back when it was made and the Simpsons having a baby, the device was never seen in any other episode.

</li><li> At this point, it's worth explaining the page quote. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminDisraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminDisraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> wanted to go into politics.

</li><li> U.S. patriots owe a lot and pay homage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, "he exemplified the emerging American nation. Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical and democratic values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> as per myth (and in real-life) was born in a log cabin, and historically ranks among the lowest-income holders of any US President coming into office. He also did not go to elite educational institutions unlike other Presidents before and after him, being almost entirely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookWorm">self-taught and autodidactic</a>. He worked as a teenager chopping wood and later as a bartender, and studied independently to qualify for his bar exam before building a very successful law practice. By the time he arrived on the political stage, Lincoln was reasonably well-off, married into the wealthy Todd family and had what we would now call "social capital".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman">Harry Truman</a> is in a similar boat, being the last US president without tertiary education, the son of a farmer who did various odd jobs until he got himself elected. After he left office, he subsisted mostly on his small army pension. Notable in that he himself had ensured public servants got generous retirement packages, but at the time, this did <em>not</em> extend to the president. The Former Presidents Act of 1958 was specifically passed so Truman would have a generous retirement, as unlike most previous presidents he was not independently wealthy.
</li><li> Many figures in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> were this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaximilienRobespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a>, Georges Danton, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just were mostly nobodies with middling careers in law who in the course of the Revolution gradually became famous across France and Europe. Since there was no political career and opportunities before the Revolution, all of them made their careers on their ability at oratory, their education and their dedication and hard work, qualities that made them and other Jacobins promote the idea of meritocracy and insist on people earning their ranks in army and political office.
</li><li> One of the beneficiaries of the above is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>. Napoleon made meritocracy part of his mystique, with the idea of soldiers being promoted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpThroughTheRanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpThroughTheRanks">Up Through the Ranks</a> and earning their titles via achievements, a myth that he occasionally did live up to. In actual fact, Bonaparte came from a family of minor Corsican nobility, and who on account of mere chance, became a French citizen at birth, and got to study in an elite military institution in France. However, Napoleon faced considerable racism in France for his origins and his accent<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1cyq8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1cyq8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1cyq8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His French sounded like an Italian speaking French and he never lost that accent</span> and would never have received rank and advancement had it not been for the Revolution and the army reforms of 1793; and later the support of wealthy patrons like Paul Barras. Napoleon's achievements were immense and prodigious but it owed a great deal to luck and "a little help from my friends".
</li><li> Toussaint Louverture, the leader and hero of the Haitian Revolution is a bigger example than any of his French contemporaries. He was born into slavery into the Caribbean plantations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Haiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Haiti">Sainte Domingue</a> who on the outbreak of revolution, despite limited education, and zero military training and education, became the military commander and leader of the revolution, defeating many professional armies and becoming an adept politician who could moderate various factions. His downfall came out of underhanded betrayal and low cunning from Napoleon rather than any mistake by Toussaint.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> was the son of a village alderman in an unremarkable small town who had no university education, no noble connections or military career (unlike other playwrights of his generation).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> was the illegitimate son of a minor nobleman who would not have inherited much by virtue of being a noble bastard (his surname Leonardo da Vinci signified the village of his origin, Vinci, rather than actual family connections). He apprenticed with the artist Verrocchio who admired his talent and patronized him. By the time of his death, he was renowned across Italy for his talent, genius, and skill and ended his career as an artist-in-residence for the King of France.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> was a self-made autodidact who didn't go to college, worked as a photographer on the streets, taught himself film-making on the cheap, and step-by-step made himself into a world-renowned film-maker without ever working for a great deal of time in Hollywood, without working in other media, or coming from independent wealth.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> was born to an average middle-class home and had no background in arts and cinema, and initially became an anthropology student before going to film school. He went from a lowly college intern on the set of one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>'s earliest films, to set film-maker, to second-unit film-maker (on <em>The Godfather</em>), to feature director of a flop (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/THX1138" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/THX1138">THX 1138</a></em>), before making his first hit (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti">American Graffiti</a></em>) and then banking it all on a film that many producers and some of his cast and crew didn't believe in, and which if it had failed, would have entirely finished his career. The result was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> whose mammoth success made him the richest independent film-maker ever, all as a result of his own ideas, conviction, determination, and talent.
</li><li> A good recent example (one taught in some schools in fact), is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ">Jay-Z</a>; who over the course of 20 years went from being a drug-dealer in Brooklyn to being one of the most successful rappers ever, as well as the CEO of a media empire (including his own record label); with a net worth estimated at around $500m. Famous in that he did not do this alone, however his business partners (who are mostly now at best moderately successful and at worst in prison) have not reached the same heights - so he must've done something right by himself.

<div class="indent"><strong>Obama</strong>: I hear all this, you know, "Well, this is class warfare, this is whatever." No. There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own  nobody. You built a factory out there? Good for you. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">I want to be clear</a>. You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police-forces and fire-forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory  and hire someone to protect against this  because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea. God bless  keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is, you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.

</li></ul></li><li> Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez, the youngest woman in history elected to the US House at 29, was born to a working-class family and worked a number of odd-jobs when she challenged incumbent Joe Crowley in 2018. She mustered $192,000 from small donors against Crowley's $3.4 million and defeated him in the primary in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssumedWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssumedWin">underdog victory</a>. This was especially shocking given that Joe Crowley was a high-ranking ten term incumbent who was in a position to become the highest ranking House Democrat. In November she easily defeated her Republican opponent and won a seat in the House, and pointed out that she couldn't rent an apartment in Washington DC until after she got her salary, as compared to many other candidates and representatives who get funding from backers, donors, and other pre-political ventures.
</li><li> Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin prove <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">you don't have to be nice to be self-made</a>. Adolf Hitler was born to a lower-middle class family. His mother and father died before he turned 18 and he ended up homeless for a while. With no higher education he became a prominent political figure and rose to rule Germany. Hitler's lack of previous rank was lampshaded by some of his generals who privately called him "The Bohemian Corporal". Stalin was born even poorer, to an alcoholic cobbler in Georgia whose alcohol shakes cost him his small business. After dropping out of school he joined the upstart Bolsheviks and cunningly made himself the effective head of a superpower for decades.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a> was born in a working class family in Edinburgh, Scotland, dropped out of school at 13, and worked many jobs including as a milkman, a coffin polisher, a lorry driver, a lifeguard, served in the Royal Navy, then worked as an artist's model before entering bodybuilding, which led him to acting and eventually his breakthrough part: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNameIsBondJamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNameIsBondJamesBond">Bond</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo">Dr. No</a></em>, and his portrayal of the sophisticated secret agent propelled him into international superstardom.
