</p><p>Usually, this trope involves an athlete getting an injury, but the career can be anything that requires physical and/or mental ability. Likewise, what causes the disability can be something other than an injury (for example, a disease) - the important point is that it prevents the character from achieving their goals by causing a disability.
</p><p>A variation is where a previously known condition or illness worsens unexpectedly to a point where the character is no longer fit for his/her career. With a character known for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron">injury-prone or just too stubborn to know when to quit</a>, this injury may represent the writing on the wall.
</p><p>Sometimes the injury is part of the backstory, but if it happens during the course of the main story, expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">Angst</a>.

In circles such as the police or the military, this is sometimes sardonically called "earning a desk job". With sports where knee collisions are a regular occurrence, the injury might be so bad that standing up (after it healed) without a cane is impossible.
</p><p>The injury may have started as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game-Breaking Injury</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteDwarfStarlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteDwarfStarlet">White-Dwarf Starlet</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender">I Coulda Been a Contender!</a>, common results of this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamCrushingHandicap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamCrushingHandicap">Dream-Crushing Handicap</a>, where the character is disabled to start with instead of becoming so during their career, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingTheCompetition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingTheCompetition">Crippling the Competition</a>, where this trope is invoked. If the character overcomes the injury, either temporarily or permanently, then they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackInTheSaddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackInTheSaddle">Back in the Saddle</a>.

May result in the character taking on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostInjuryDeskJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostInjuryDeskJob">Post-Injury Desk Job</a>.

<ul><li> Discussed with Yuutaro, the second student of the revived Kamiya Kasshin School, who ends up in the way of one of Raijuta's air-slicing attacks that severs the tendons in his sword-arm. While Kaoru and Yahiko mourn the loss of their promising junior, Yuutaro himself declares that if he can't use his right hand anymore, he'll use his left instead...and his rich dad is willing to send him to doctors in Germany to try and repair his right arm anyway. A brief glance at the dojo's wall in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> shows Yuutaro listed as a junior instructor.
</li><li> The Meiji government tried to invoke this on Makoto Shishio, Kenshin's successor as Manslayer because they feared his ambition. They jumped him at night, knocked him out, and burned him alive. That certainly ended his old career. Unfortunately for the government, it just made Shishio angry
</li><li> At the beginning of the "Jinchuu" arc, a flashback shows that near the end of the civil war, Kenshin fought a massive samurai working for the Shogunate and cut off his sword hand. When the samurai demanded Kenshin kill him because of this, Kenshin refused. The samurai did <em>not</em> take the mercy well, and carried a grudge for years.
</li><li> In the finale, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kenshin's career as a swordsman is brought to an end because his fragile build couldn't keep up with the demands of his sword style, resulting in irreparable damage to his muscle tissue. He's just fine with this, however, since he's brought closure to his past and wishes to settle down with Kaoru</span>.
</li><li> Anime-only example: In the first episode, Gohei Hiruma was a former student at the Kamiya Kasshin dojo who harassed and was overly violent towards the other students. In retaliation, Kaoru's father shattered Gohei's right thumb, specifically mentioning this trope as the reason. It doesn't take, as Gohei learns to fight left-handed  which is what clues Kenshin into having Kaoru check her father's old records. During their fight, Kenshin shatters the knuckles on Gohei's <em>left</em> hand, ensuring that he can never hold a sword again.

<ul><li> Bruce from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> gives up crime fighting due to a heart condition. On its own, it probably wouldn't mean much, but the circumstances caused him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun">point a gun at someone</a>.
</li><li> This trope is used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> The Bronze Kneecap explains that tripping over the Crimson Chin's titular facial feature was what caused him to injure his knee and ended his career. He subsequently smelts all of his bronze trophies and makes them into his villain costume. Timmy views this as a major overreaction and the Bronze Kneecap responds that the Crimson Chin never even said he was sorry.
<ul><li> It should also be noted that Timmy unwittingly did the same thing to Mr. Bickles during the episode and manages to evade such extreme repercussions by apologizing and effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath">Talking the Monster to Death</a>. (Although Timmy didn't actually injure Mr. Bickles. He just put on a better magic act and consequently drove him out of business.) It's hard to feel sorry for him given that he's basically a spoof of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide-Eyed Idealist</a> who has a new "Dream" every single solitary episode. The fact that Timmy ruined one out of countless and merely by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">being better at it</a> makes Mr. Bickles seem like a stupid selfish baby.
</li><li> This trope is played with for yet another episode. In this one, Timmy cannot sing his part for Mr. Bickles' play because he needs his tonsils taken out. That doesn't stop him from trying to sing anyway, but does Mr. Bickles take it well when Timmy fails due to his aching throat? No. He just drops to his knees and whines about his so-called dream being ruined. This time someone else's career is "ended" by someone else's illness.

<ul><li> American Football:
<ul><li> In one the most well-known examples from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">NFL</a>, Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann was forced to retire after a Monday Night Football game in 1985. On a failed attempt to trick the New York Giants' defense, Theisman was sacked by all-pro linebacker Lawrence Taylor. As Taylor forced Theisman to the ground, his knee came down on Theisman's leg and snapped the tibia and fibula. While this incident helped cement Taylor's fearsome reputation, Taylor himself was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">clearly horrified</a> and immediately leaped up and called for medical assistance for Theisman as soon as the play ended. Sadly, some fans mistook his frantic motions for help as Taylor celebrating the crippling hit and thought him a dirty player for a while.
</li><li> For most of the history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a>, rotator cuff injuries to the throwing arm have been a death sentence for quarterbacks. Probably the most tragic case was Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Greg Cook, who after a rookie season in 1969 that left many excited about his NFL future, tore his rotator cuff and was out of football with only that rookie season under his belt.
</li><li> Chicago Bears player Gale Sayers had to retire after injuring first one knee (the one depicted in the film <em>Brian's Song</em>) and then the other, both injuries requiring surgery and extensive rehab. He now works with a group that raises funds for injured players and their families.
</li><li> There might have been three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Manning</a> Brothers in the NFL in the 21st century if eldest son Cooper, who was an all-state wide receiver during his high school days in Mississippi and was considered a hot prospect recruit for Ole Miss, hadn't been diagnosed with a spinal condition that ended his playing days.
</li><li> Detroit Lions guard Mike Utley saw his career end suddenly when an on-field injury to his cervical vertebrae resulted in paralysis. Depending on the source, he was immediately left a paraplegic or quadriplegic from this.
</li><li> New England Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley's football career ended immediately after a devastating hit from Oakland Raiders safety Jack Tatum broke his upper spine in a preseason game. He was left a quadriplegic and died several years later from heart problems related to his paralysis.
</li><li> One of few players to have a significant professional career in two sports, Oakland Raiders running back Bo Jackson suffered a sudden career-ending football injury when he dislocated a hip (with subsequent hip bone fracturing and bone tissue death in the joint) after being tackled on-field. He never played football again, and his baseball career ceased a few years later.
</li><li> Hall of Fame Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin retired suddenly after being tackled hard by Philadelphia Eagles safety Tim Hauck. Irvin suffered a non-life-threatening spinal cord injury on the play.
</li></ul></li><li> Basketball:
<ul><li> New York Liberty star Kym Hampton had to retire from the WNBA after injuring her knee.
</li><li> Boban Janković, a Serbian basketball star who played in the Greek league in the early 1990s, was permanently paralyzed after he damaged his spinal cord by headbutting the basket post in response to the referee calling an offensive foul on him with 8 minutes to go in a playoff match. He used a wheelchair for the final 13 years of his life and died of a heart attack at the age of 42.
</li></ul></li><li> Baseball:
<ul><li> New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig had to retire from baseball due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (which became known in North America as Lou Gehrig's disease).
</li><li> Sandy Koufax of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers, arguably the most dominating pitcher in MLB since the "Dead Ball Era," was forced to retire at age 30 after developing arthritis in his pitching arm.
</li><li> Roy Campanella spent ten seasons as a catcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers, but never got to play in Los Angeles. In the offseason of the team's move, he was paralyzed when his rented 1957 Chevrolet sedan hit a patch of ice, skidded into a telephone pole, and overturned. His neck was broken, the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae in his back were fractured and his spinal cord was compressed. While he <em>was</em> paralyzed from the shoulders down at first (and ended up needing a wheelchair for the rest of his life), extensive physical therapy eventually allowed him to regain the use of his arms and hands.
</li><li> Houston Astros pitcher J.R. Richard's major league career came to an abrupt end after suffering a stroke at age 30. He made a few short-lived attempts to restart his career in the minors afterwards, but was unsuccessful.
</li><li> Dave Dravecky, a pitcher for the San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants, developed a cancerous tumor in his pitching arm at age 32; he first had surgery to remove the growth and then underwent a year's rehabilitation. His comeback attempt lasted all of two games, when the humerus bone in his pitching arm suddenly snapped in mid-pitch, ending his career for good. Cancer returned to his pitching arm later that year, forcing its amputation.
</li><li> Several players had their careers ruined after getting hit in the head while up to bat. A few examples resulted in their immediate retirement.
<ul><li> Hall of Fame catcher Mickey Cochrane's career with the Detroit Tigers ended immediately after he was severely beaned by pitcher Bump Hadley. Cochrane was knocked unconscious and hospitalized in a coma for ten days afterward.
</li><li> Kirby Puckett, Hall of Fame center fielder for the Minnesota Twins, had his playing career end after being hit in the face by a pitch from Dennis Martinez and subsequently developing glaucoma. He never played again.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Racing:
<ul><li> Alessandro "Alex" Zanardi, former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">Indy Car</a> racing driver, lost both of his legs in a <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/KysP71KKzIc">horrific crash<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that nearly killed him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">He made the best of it</a> and started two new careers. He proved competitive in his first in touring car racing, using a car fitted with hand controls. His second post-injury career as a Paralympic athlete in handcycling was even more successful than either of his auto racing careers. He won three medals, two of them gold, in the 2012 London Paralympics, and did the same at Rio in 2016.
</li><li> In the second race of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">Indy Car</a> doubleheader at Houston in 2013, Takuma Sato got loose and slid into Dario Franchitti's car, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWivplBtgAo">sending him twirling into the catch fence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Franchitti suffered a broken back and ankle in the crash, as well as a concussion so severe that he later stated he doesn't remember anything from two weeks before the crash to three weeks after. On the advice of his doctors, he retired from racing a month later. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mm9i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mm9i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mm9i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This was Franchitti's third concussion in ten years, and motorsport drivers are just as prone to CTE as football players (they may have fewer concussions, but at higher impacts, so one crash is basically like getting tackled ten times at once). Franchitti was warned that the next crash and next concussion could severely incapacitate him if it didn't outright kill him.</span>
</li><li> Racing driver Tetsuya Ota was forced to quit racing due to losing function in his right arm and leg after a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCfaNRS-JQ">fiery accident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1998, where his Ferrari spun out and hit an already spun-out Porsche, creating a fantastic fireball and sending him rolling across the track. The first one on scene was another racer with a fire extinguisher to put out his flaming car. Safety marshals arrived over ten seconds later to extract him and take him to a waiting track van (not an ambulance) to go to the medical center. For reference, he spent 90 seconds from impact in his flaming car, long enough that his visor melted and caused facial scarring when he was laid on his back that required plastic surgery to repair.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a>:
<ul><li> Ernie Irvan ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subverting</a> this with his near-fatal crash at Michigan in 1994. While he did get back into the car by 1996, and even won in 1997 at the same track that almost killed him, the simple fact of the matter was that he just wasn't a championship-level driver after the wreck (he had been in the midst of challenging Dale Earnhardt for the 1994 title before the injury), and several more head injuries after his comeback drove him to retire in 1999.
</li><li> Bobby Allison's near-fatal wreck at Pocono in 1988 was a more immediate instance of this, since, as soon as he recovered enough to set up a press conference, he announced his retirement from NASCAR. The fact that he was fifty years old probably helped with that decision.
</li><li> Jerry Nadeau suffered a traumatic brain injury after striking the turn three wall head-on with a hung throttle at Richmond in 2003. Due in part to the lack of understanding about Nadeau's injury at the time, he ended up with permanent brain damage from the resulting swelling, and given that another head injury would likely kill him, he's certain not to be cleared to race ever again.
</li><li> Dale Earnhardt, Jr. was sidelined for the back half of the 2016 season due to lingering concussion-like symptoms from earlier crashes. He had previously been sidelined for two races in the fall of 2012 after taking a concussion in a last-lap crash at Talladega. Although he came back for the 2017 season, he chose to retire from Cup racing at the end of that season for the sake of his health.
</li><li> Sterling Marlin suffered a terrible crash at Kansas in 2002, that resulted in him missing the rest of the season becuase he suffered a cracked vertebra in his neck. Although he returned to continue racing, he wasn't the same driver as he was before the injury.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Cycling:
<ul><li> Colombian cyclist Mauricio Soler crashed on the 6th stage of the 2011 Tour de Suisse. At the time, he was in second and had won the second stage, as well as generally looking to be at the top of his form. He crashed going downhill at 80 km/h, and suffered a fractured skull, cerebral edema, other fractures, and hematomas, to the point where he had to be put in a medically induced coma. Over a year later, he announced that he wouldn't try to return to the sport.
</li><li> Kristina Vogel had a serious cycling accident in June 2018, rendering her paraplegic. This is especially tragic since she is the <em>world-class</em>, if not the most, cyclist that had <em>won</em> several cycling races in her career, including the Olympic Games.
</li></ul></li><li> Gymnastics:
<ul><li> Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson, best known for competing in the 2008 Beijing games, had to retire from gymnastics for good just before the 2012 London games due to a knee injury.
</li><li> Elena Mukhina was left paralysed from the neck down in 1980 while practising the extremely difficult and hazardous Thomas salto, which led to the move being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">banned for women in competition. As of the 2017-2020 quad, rollout skills (except for a simple dive/hecht roll), including the Thomas salto, have been banned for both men and women</a>.
</li><li> Julissa Gomez was paralysed from the neck down in 1988 after smashing head-first into a vaulting horse. A further non-sporting accident in a hospital killed her a short time later. This incident led to major reforms in vaulting in general.
</li><li> Sang Lan was paralysed from the chest down in 1998 after a simple warm-up move went freakishly wrong because she was distracted by a coach.
</li><li> Kerri Strug's famous vault during the 1996 Summer Olympics would end up becoming her last-ever gymnastics performance, with the ankle injury she sustained forcing her to retire shortly thereafter.
</li><li> In a variation, 2012 Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney sustained numerous separate injuries over the course of several years; she might have overcome any one of them individually, but the cumulative nature of them, as well as the fact that her coaches pressured her to keep training through them, would ultimately prove too much for her body to handle. Maroney, who had at one time professed a desire to be on the 2016 Olympic team, retired in early 2016.
</li></ul></li><li> Hockey:
<ul><li> Toronto Maple Leafs winger Ace Bailey's NHL career came to an abrupt end during the December 13, 1933, Leafs-Bruins game when Eddie Shore, aiming for Red Horner, checked him to the ice and fractured his skull.
</li><li> In one of the most infamous cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness">Unnecessary Roughness</a> in NHL history, Colorado Avalanche forward Steve Moore's career was cut short in 2004, when he was sucker-punched from behind by Vancouver Canucks forward Todd Bertuzzi during a game, which broke three vertebrae in his neck (though, fortunately, he was not paralyzed as a result), left him with a serious concussion, and caused him to suffer several other injuries during the fight that broke out when his teammates rushed to his defense. Despite attempts to stage a comeback the following year, he continued to suffer concussion-like symptoms and was never medically cleared to play again.
</li><li> In 1995, hockey player Travis Roy crashed head-first into the boards and severed his spine, becoming a quadriplegic, just 11 seconds into his first shift as a member of the Boston University hockey team, his boyhood dream.
</li></ul></li><li> Other competitive:
<ul><li> Bill McLaren was on the verge of playing his first game for Scotland's national rugby team when he contracted a near-fatal case of TB and was forced to give up playing. He went on to become a renowned commentator, earning him a nickname of "the voice of rugby".
</li><li> It was strictly speaking a hobby rather than his career, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a> of England was very fond of the sport of jousting until a serious accident in the lists stopped him at the age of 44. This was very significant because he seemed likely to die for a while, the shock may have caused his then-pregnant wife to miscarry, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-jousting-accident-that-turned-henry-viii-into-a-tyrant-1670421.html">modern historians theorize that he may have suffered brain damage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that turned him from a tough but sane and competent king into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">dangerous tyrant</a>.
</li><li> Maureen Connolly, one of the greatest women's tennis players of the 1950s, had her career end suddenly when her right leg was crushed in a horse-riding accident at age 19.
</li><li> Competitors in mind sports suffer career-ending injuries too. Chess grandmaster <a class="urllink" href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessplayer?pid=16564">Milko Bobotsov<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a world-class player until he suffered a near-fatal stroke in 1972 after a tournament. He survived, but was never the same again.
</li></ul></li><li> Athletes who became famous as performers:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a> originally wanted to be a professional footballer, but a back injury put an end to his early career. Considering he's now a world-famous actor and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">the Eleventh Doctor</a>, we're going to go out on a limb and presume he's not too bitter about it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanCain">Dean Cain</a>'s college football career was ended by a shoulder injury.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JakeOwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JakeOwen">Jake Owen</a> originally wanted to be a professional golfer, but a serious accident while wakeboarding resulted in reconstructive surgery that left him unable to continue.
</li><li> Latin pop legend Julio Iglesias was a goalkeeper for Real Madrid Castilla, the reserve team of the legendary Spanish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football</a> club until injuries suffered in an auto accident left him unable to walk for two years. While he was hospitalized, a nurse gave him a guitar to keep his hands occupied, and he discovered a gift for music.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay">Gordon Ramsay</a>'s footballer ambitions were ended by multiple knee injuries in his late teens.
</li><li> Country star <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChadBrownlee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChadBrownlee">Chad Brownlee</a> was a first-round NHL draft pick until he messed up his knee in a game.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein">Rammstein</a> vocalist Till Lindemann had been a competitive swimmer in his youth and even qualified for participating in the 1980 Olympics. A stomach injury (and a falling out with the coaches) had put the brakes on that. It's entirely possible that if his swimming career hadn't been cut short, Rammstein may not have formed at all.
</li><li> A lot of dancers tend to become actors or similar performers later on due to accidents. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SummerGlau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SummerGlau">Summer Glau</a>, for instance, got her start as an actress after a broken toe forced her to put her career as a ballerina on hold.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CostasMandylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CostasMandylor">Costas Mandylor</a> was a professional soccer player for both Australia and Greece, but stress fractures to his shins eventually forced him to give up the sport.
</li></ul></li><li> Acting and performing:
<ul><li> Actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve">Christopher Reeve</a>, best known for his role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> in the 1978 film series, was forced to quit acting in 1995 when a cervical spinal injury from a horse-riding accident paralyzed him. However, he would return a few times, in an updated version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RearWindow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RearWindow">Rear Window</a>, and a guest-starring role on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DudleyMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DudleyMoore">Dudley Moore</a>'s final years saw him slowly succumb to progressive supranuclear palsy, which ended his dual careers as an actor and pianist — he lost a role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMirrorHasTwoFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMirrorHasTwoFaces">The Mirror Has Two Faces</a></em> due to losing the ability to remember lines (as this happened before the fatal diagnosis, he was regarded as merely unprofessional at best), and the illness slowly robbed him of the dexterity he needed to play piano.
</li><li> Roy Horn, of the stage magician duo Siegfried and Roy, got infamously mauled by a white tiger during a show on October 3, 2003. Their show, until then one of the most successful in Las Vegas's history, came to an immediate halt, and the incident was one of the contributing factors (along with protests by animal rights groups and the success of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil">Cirque du Soleil</a>) in ending the use of exotic animals in magic acts.
</li><li> Illusionist Wayne Dobson was a big star in the UK in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He's still very active as a devisor of magic tricks and is well-known and respected in the industry, but hasn't been in the public eye since mobility issues caused by multiple sclerosis led him to step back from performing in the mid-1990s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraKamiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraKamiya">Akira Kamiya</a> is one of the biggest names of Japanese voice acting in the 1980's to 1990's, best known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Kenshiro</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">Ryo Saeba</a> and many many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">Super Robot Genre</a> protagonists that required him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">yell a lot of attack names</a> (Chief amongst them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo">Ryouma Nagare</a>). Not to mention he tend to reprise the last ones if they reappear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> and recorded <em>even more yellings</em>. Eventually, his lungs gave out and he has stated that he would no longer be able to make such kind of voice acting anymore, so he either tutors the latter generation of voice actors or do roles that didn't require him to yell a lot (for example, the aforementioned Ryo Saeba). This is also why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> slowly phased out the usage of series that starred Kamiya in concern of his lung health.
</li></ul></li><li> Music:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Immortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Immortal">Immortal</a> guitarist and lyricist Demonaz Doom Occulta was forced to abandon the former role because of severe tendinitis in his arms, though he is still considered an active member by the band. Demonaz eventually was able to return to playing guitar with the band, and took over lead vocals from Abbath after his departure.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Suffocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Suffocation">Suffocation</a> guitarist Doug Cerrito will almost certainly never be involved in music again due to crippling arthritis.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Unearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Unearth">Unearth</a> drummer Nick Pierce narrowly subverted this after sustaining a back injury sometime after joining the band. He left the injury, a slipped disc, only partially treated for several years, and the disc began to calcify and push up against his spine, eventually piercing it and causing it to leak fluid. This led to his leg atrophying to the point that it was beginning to noticeably wither, which eventually forced him to pull off the band's 2016 Fury Tour after playing with excruciating back and leg pain for the first three and a half weeks of the tour. Back surgery to more fully correct the injury wasn't initially as effective as hoped, and he spent the rest of the year on the sidelines working to recover while the band toured with a fill-in.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1l1pi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1l1pi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1l1pi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Wovenwar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AsILayDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AsILayDying">As I Lay Dying</a> drummer Jordan Mancino</span> He was ultimately able to recover and rejoined the band for a mini-tour at the beginning of 2017.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Megadeth</a> broke up from 2002-04 because of Dave Mustaine's subversion due to nerve damage (caused by him falling asleep with his left arm draped over a chair back). Mustaine also became a born-again Christian during his recovery.
</li><li> Ultimately subverted by Tony Iommi of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a>. On his last day of work in a sheet metal shop, he accidentally cut off the tips of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand. He thought his music career was over until his supervisor played him a record by jazz guitarist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DjangoReinhardt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DjangoReinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a>, who only had two fingers on his fret hand. This inspired Tony to continue in music. He made prosthetic tips for the two fingers he lost, then down-tuned his guitar a full step to make it easier to bend the strings. This gave Black Sabbath their signature sound.
</li><li> Shred guitarist <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonBecker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonBecker">Jason Becker</a> was put out of commission due to Lou Gehrig's Disease. He can still compose music using a computer, though, so the trope is ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrakeBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrakeBell">Drake Bell</a> injured his wrist in a way that he supposedly could never play guitar again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">It later turned out that he could still play.</a>
</li><li> Blues rock legend Dr. John started out as a guitarist and only switched to the piano (with which he became famous) after he was shot in the hand during a bar fight, suffering a permanent loss of movement in one finger that left it too stiff to play guitar but capable of pressing a key.
</li><li> After suffering a brain aneurysm in 1995, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> drummer Bill Berry left the group in 1997 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAgriculture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAgriculture">and became a farmer</a>, but has occasionally returned to one-off performances, like R.E.M.'s 2007 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a>:
<ul><li> Brian Johnson's tenure as the singer came to an end in 2016, with the official reason for his departure being hearing problems that made it unsafe for him to continue performing with the band. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">Johnson himself</a>, however, claims that his hearing problems were not caused by performing, but from neglecting to wear ear protection during a car race, and that the other members of the band blew his injuries out of proportion to justify forcing him out.
</li><li> Co-founder Malcolm Young was forced to retire when he was diagnosed with early-onset dementia. He died sometime later.
</li></ul></li><li> Jeff Becerra, frontman of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Possessed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Possessed">Possessed</a>, was shot and left paralyzed in a botched robbery in 1989. Ultimately subverted in that while he can no longer play the bass, he still performs lead vocals.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject">Ex-Morning Musume</a> member Aika Mitsui had to graduate from the group earlier than she wanted, due to a particularly bad foot injury. After spending a few years in New Zealand to study English, she now mainly works under Hello! Project as a reporter and middleman for overseas promotion.
</li><li> Averted by Marc Almond. In 2004, he was involved in a motorbike crash which nearly left him dead and might easily have ended his singing career. However, within a few years, he had recovered sufficiently to start singing again.
</li><li> Indie rockers The Long Blondes disbanded in 2008 after guitarist and lyricist Dorian Cox suffered a stroke. While he survived, Cox was unable to play guitar for several years and the band decided not to continue without him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuincyJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuincyJones">Quincy Jones</a> was forced to quit playing the trumpet after suffering a aneurysm. The doctors had to implant a steel plate which they feared could come loose if he were to play again. He has since turned to producing music.
</li><li> Cellist Jacqueline du Pré was forced to retire from performing in 1973 at the age of 28 due to multiple sclerosis. The disease would eventually claim her life 14 years later.
</li></ul></li><li> Dance:
<ul><li> Soloist Kathryn Morgan of the New York City Ballet was five years into a <em>very</em> promising career (she was on the fast track to becoming a principal ballerina with the company) when she was hit by Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which unfortunately put an end to her time with the company. She has since made a name for herself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> dance guru, and after seven years away, subverted the trope when she joined the incredibly well-respected Miami City Ballet as a soloist in 2019.
</li><li> Just barely averted by world-famous ballerina Alicia Alonso, whose struggle with a detached retina and subsequent blindness nearly ended her career. After a third and final surgery, she was put on complete bed rest for a full year. She went on to become one of the greatest prima ballerinas in history.
<div class="indent"><strong>Alonso</strong>: I danced in my mind. Blind, motionless, flat on my back, I taught myself to dance <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Giselle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Giselle">Giselle</a></em>.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Art:
<ul><li> Manga author Daisuke Ashihara succumbed to a form of juvenile arthritis that rendered it incredibly painful for him to draw, such that his series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WorldTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WorldTrigger">World Trigger</a></em>, had to be put on indefinite hiatus on November 2016. This overlaps with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamCrushingHandicap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamCrushingHandicap">Dream-Crushing Handicap</a>, as he had this arthritis from the moment he started his career, and it <em>did</em> hurt for him to draw right from the start, but it didn't become debilitating until later. In late October 2018, he managed to avert this trope, with him recovering enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackInTheSaddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackInTheSaddle">continue drawing</a> <em>World Trigger</em>, and with the series moving to a monthly magazine so as not to stress his bones so much.
</li></ul></li><li> Military:
<ul><li> Saint Ignatius of Loyola became a major reformer of the Catholic Church after a cannonball injury to the leg forced him to give up battle.
</li><li> Subverted with General Lefebvre. He was severely wounded in the arm while fighting the Austrians in 1798, which left him unable to exercise command, and he began a career as a Senator instead; indeed, when Napoleon created his eighteen original Marshals in 1804, he was one of the four generals who received the baton as a reward for past service to the Republic and was not meant to see the battlefields again. However, it turned out that the wound was not as crippling as was initially thought, and Lefebvre went on to fight in most campaigns of the Empire, including the invasion of Russia.
</li><li> Played straight in a sense by the infamous turncoat Benedict Arnold. The knee injury sustained at the Battle of Saratoga caused him to be given the military governorship of Philadelphia to recuperate. It was during this time that all the initial charges of using his position to profit were made against him, causing him to seek out the British. He would serve as a general in the British Army, but for all intents and purposes, this was the end of his career in the American Continental Army.
</li><li> Aaron Burr had to resign his commission and leave the Continental Army after a heat stroke during the Battle of Monmouth severe enough to leave him <em>comatose</em> for several days. It became apparent after he woke up that he wasn't going to be in any shape to do much of <em>anything</em>, let alone fight. He did eventually end up mostly recovering, and even rejoining the war effort (unofficially), but his health was permanently damaged and he showed symptoms of brain damage for the rest of his life.
