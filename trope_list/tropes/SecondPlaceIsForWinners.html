</p><p>This can take several forms:
</p><ol><li> The character doesn't know beforehand what the prizes are, or only knows what first prize is. This generally leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a> where they try their best at the contest, are disappointed to learn they didn't win, and then overjoyed to learn that they got what they wanted anyway. For example, if first prize is money which the character wants in order to buy X, then second prize will turn out to be X.
</li><li> The character does know beforehand what the prizes are, resulting in a non–video game version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">Do Well, but Not Perfect</a>. For added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity</a>, they might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">win anyway despite trying to come in second</a>.
</li><li> The character is a rookie having his first shot at the big-time, and would have no realistic chance of winning this soon (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdogsNeverLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdogsNeverLose">despite what most sports movies would have you believe</a>). The fact that he or she manages to place <em>at all</em> is considered a moral victory.
</li><li> The structure of a competition is such that not finishing first now will give the character an advantage in finishing first at a later event or portion of the event.
</li><li> A variation of this is when the runner-up is remembered more than the actual winner. This often happens in sports and reality shows (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunnerUpTakesItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunnerUpTakesItAll">The Runner-Up Takes It All</a>).

A normally rather lazy dog, Largo displays surprising bursts of prescience, often causing trouble that unexpectedly draws people away from dangerous areas. When Pinoco realizes this, she decides to try and profit from it, having Largo pick a number for a Lottery for her, hoping to win the First Prize - a romantic holiday on a southern island, just perfect for her and her 'husband', Black Jack. Instead, they win a lesser prize — several pounds of Steak. Over a steak dinner, she complains to Black Jack that Largo apparently isn't psychic after all, but he corrects her: to Largo, a pallet of delicious meat is simply far more valuable than some vacation he probably wouldn't get to go on anyway.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers">Boys over Flowers</a></em>, Tsukushi enters a fashion contest where (due to nepotism) the 1st place winner has been preordained. She wins second place, but since that was the highest spot that hadn't been "reserved," it effectively makes her the winner of the contest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> uses this once or twice.
<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy">Krillin</a> faces Piccolo Jr. in the final tournament, he manages to withstand the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> much longer than expected. When he finally declares "I give up", Piccolo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating">Unsportsmanlike Gloating</a> turns to confusion and anger when the crowd starts cheering for Krillin. Turns out Piccolo was impressed by Krillin, so much that he used his full power for a few seconds. After noticing that Krillin isn't the strongest by any means, Piccolo thinks conquering Earth might not be as easy as planned.
</li><li> Of course also used with Goku himself during the first two tournaments, which he notably lost by the end, but still managed to do so well that everyone was proud of his efforts. Additionally, after the first tournament, Goku lost but still ultimately got to use the prize money, as he was so exhausted from fighting that he ate everything at a restaurant during the group's celebratory dinner. The bill was so high that Roshi had to pay with all his winnings he won in disguise.
</li></ul></li><li> Team Sugo Asurada from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula">Future GPX Cyber Formula</a></em> does not expect much of a success. After all, their racing crew is consists of only handful of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> which barely fills the pitlane and a 14 year-old driver who had no experience in racing. That Hayato finishes third or fourth a number of times makes them more happy than people who get a win, much to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Randoll</a>'s confusion.
</li><li> Used by Shikamaru Nara in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> during the Chunin exam finals. Up against Temari, he starts off struggling to keep up with her brute force until he finally gets the upper hand. And then decides to throw in the towel, much to all of the exam participants' disappointment. However, the team leaders note this actually shows off Shikamaru's tactical skill in that he knows when to quit, rather than continue on in vain.
<ul><li> Note that it had been made clear beforehand that passing the exam was not dependent on winning the tournament. That Shikamaru managed to fight well enough, yet had the levelheadedness to concede when he reached his limits, led to him being the only one who actually passed the exam anyway. Though with the tournament being interrupted in the midst of the final match of the opening round by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Sound-Sand invasion of Konoha</span>, it's impossible to know whether anybody else would've been able to impress the examiners enough for promotion. Since there's no limit on the number that can earn the promotion from Genin to Chunin, this wouldn't have changed anything for Shikamaru, but it's likely that at least some other people would've been promoted too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em>XY</em>, Ash enters with his three Flying-Type Pokémon Fletchinder, Hawlucha and Noibat the Pokémon Sky Ralley contest, a contest where a team of three flying (or levitating or gliding) Pokémon are doing a race. They become the runner-up, since the newborn Noibat just learned how to fly during that contest... which is the point why they entered the tournament in the first place: to motivate Noibat to learn flying. Ash, Hawlucha and Fletchinder are more than happy that Noibat finally learned it and they forget the fact that they lost the ralley.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though Ash ultimately lost at the finals during the Lumiose Conference, he fares better than the actual victor, Alain. During the League ceremony, Team Flare launch their attack upon Lumiose City. Alain, being involved with Team Flare, suffers the worst kind of loss when he realizes that his entire goal was a lie, and his boss Lysandre only cares about power, ignoring Mega Evolution in favor of a potentially more powerful Bond Phenomenon that Ash possesses. In the aftermath of the Flare crisis, Ash is constantly recognized and praised by young trainers as the Conference League finalist while Alain quietly rebuilds his life with Prof. Sycamore, and privately admits Ash to be the superior trainer. Since the League ceremony wasn't finished when Team Flare attacked, it is heavily modified and officially makes everyone who stood against Lysandre champions of the Kalos League, rendering the League results moot.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a> for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a Scrooge McDuck story where the Billionaire's Club announces a variety of extravagant, chess-themed prizes for whoever makes the most money during the year... a gold-and-platinum chess-set for the first place, a gold-and-silver chess-set for the second place, and a silver-and-bronze chess-set for third place. And, as a consolation-prize for whoever makes the <em>least</em> money during the year, an Ebony pawn and a waived membership fee (said fee had just been raised by a couple of percents, causing Scrooge to faint). At this announcement, Scrooge declares his intention to win the Last Prize, no matter the cost, with most of his colleagues assuming that he'd just gone nuts due to the increased membership-fee. Of course, even when he <em>tries</em> to lose money, he can't manage it — and in the end, he had to put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> in charge of his business-empire for a month in order to drive down his stock-prices sufficiently to wind up dead last. Having finally succeeded, he reveals to Donald the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee">real</a></em> reason he was after the consolation-prize: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Ebony Pawn is actually an antique, originally part of a gem-encrusted chess-set owned by the Queen of Sheba. Said chess-set was in his possession, and with the last, missing pawn restored, the total value of the now-complete, historic chess-set redoubles sufficiently to more than make up for the losses he suffered during the contest.</span>
</li><li> There's another where the main attraction of an auction is a gazillion-dollar bill. Scrooge and another billionaire are soon the only two left making increasingly larger bids. Strangely, Scrooge seems to lose interest at one point, so Donald steps in and announces a bigger price, to Scrooge's anger. Then the rival tops that, Scrooge fails to follow up, and the auction is closed. As the billionaire starts to gloat, Scrooge gently reminds him that he paid two gazillion dollars for a <em>one</em>-gazillion dollar bill.
</li><li> Lots of different stories where Donald goes against his impossibly lucky cousin Gladstone use one of three variants (see also under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Born Lucky</a>):
<ul><li> Donald seems to beat Gladstone's luck, but in the end, it turns out the "first prize" (which can mean a lot of things from an actual contest to, say, a date with Daisy or the lead role in a play) isn't actually desirable after all, so Gladstone wins anyway, if nothing else because he gets to gloat.
</li><li> The reverse: Gladstone's luck seems to be ensuring his victory, but in the end, it turns out the first prize isn't desirable after all, so he actually loses, and Donald wins at least by getting to see him lose.
</li><li> Donald gets the main prize and is happy with it, but Gladstone's luck gets him something else, such as money, that he's at least as happy with.
</li></ul></li><li> In one story, a billionaire is selling a small house he has by the beach and, under the belief he means his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">beach manor</a> and being arrogant about how he describes it, Scrooge McDuck and Flintheart Glomgold want to buy it. Since neither of them is willing to pay more than one million dollars, the billionaire will sell the place to the buyer who defeats the other buyer in a game of rock-paper-scissors and they'll have one day to decide what each one will call. Scrooge's spies find out what Glomgold will call but his nephews find out the "small house" is an old and broken place instead of the manor as initially assumed and Scrooge decides to lose the game on purpose. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted because Glomgold finds a treasure in the place and it's worth <em>ten</em> million dollars.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the graphic novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> and Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment</em>, Strange and Doom are the first- and second-place finishers in a contest of mages to determine the title of Sorcerer Supreme. Strange wins/retains the title, and an obligation to do a favor for the person who finished second. He's not pleased. Doom, on the other hand, is only too happy to have Strange in his debt. Fortunately for Strange, Doom simply wants his help to free his mother's soul <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">from Mephisto</a>. It's implied that Doom entered the contest knowing he wouldn't win, just to get the favor.

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FantasyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FantasyIsland">Fantasy Island</a></em> had Tattoo spend a lot of money trying to win second prize in a jingle contest (a fur coat; not to wear but to give to a pretty lady of his choosing). Unfortunately, he won the much grander first prize…a trip to Fantasy Island.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Show</a> example: second and third place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> now take home $2000 and $1000 instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsolationPrize">Consolation Prize</a>. This means it's possible, and has sometimes happened, that the champion's first-day winnings are <em>less</em> than what the losers go home with. Of course, the losers <em>have</em> to go home, while the champion gets the chance to win more money, but it can still be odd seeing a champion with under $1000.

<ul><li> The game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfBaronMunchausen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfBaronMunchausen">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a></em> (basically "who can tell the best bullshit story in the style of the movie") is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">presented as</a> something the Baron invented and is now explaining. Near the end, he mentions a session whose winners got the cushier bedrooms while spending the weekend at their host's manor, and deliberately shooting for something like fourth place so he could sneak out and chat up one of the daughters later.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin">Munchkin</a></em>, it is somewhat common for games to play out like this. When the player in the lead is close to winning, the other players will gang up on the leader to prevent him/her from winning. Once everyone has used all their cards and abilities to prevent the strongest player from winning, the second strongest player usually has an easier shot at victory. This can also sometimes have elements of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingmakerScenario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingmakerScenario">Kingmaker Scenario</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">Do Well, but Not Perfect</a>.
</li><li> Perhaps this shows up in Warhammer Fantasy for the Skaven's Clan Eshin. Clan Eshin are very happy to be 2nd fiddle as a reward for saving the other Skavens from the Clan Pestilens onslaught. Being in 2nd place amongst the clans means a guarantee of perks such as police powers, steady source of warpstone, plenty of slaves and food. Had they tried to make a bid for the throne they'd have to contend with all the major Clans out there for dominance. By enforcing the Grey Seers and Clan Skryre's leadership, they always have their backing which forces everyone else to duke it out for 3rd place.
</li><li> There's an interesting variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SettlersOfCatan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SettlersOfCatan">Settlers of Catan</a></em>: When initially setting up the board, each player places two settlements.

Some players prefer to go last in the order, as there can be some tactical advantage in having two "average" locations and being able to place both settlements at once, like being able to select potentially better first resources. (The players get free resources as their second city would produce. While the first players have to scramble for location, the last can place his both cities in any order).
</li><li> The card game called "Asshole" in which the loser has to give his best cards to the winner in the next round, the last-but-one to the second place and so on. Some consider it preferable to take the middle place, where you get the leftover cards, than the place one better than that.
</li><li> Some bases in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SmashUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SmashUp">Smash Up</a></em> award more points for second-highest power than for highest power when the base breaks.

<ul><li> Getting a raise puts you in a higher tax bracket, meaning you take home less pay and it's better to get a promotion with more benefits but the same wage. Why is this in "Urban Legends?" Because that's not how tax brackets work. It's a scare tactic some employers use to deter employees from accepting a raise.

Quitting after the 8 bosses nets the player an indestructible shield, which is unarguably the best prize in that minigame and <em>much</em> more valuable than the 9900 Rupees you get for the top prize (though you can just go through the challenge again with your new shield and get that, too).
</li><li> Code Master's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> games have a special reaction for a player driver who finishes better than expected. For example, Tier-3 teams like Williams and Toro Rosso are happy enough if you grab a podium finish. The lowest-tier drivers from Caterham and Marussia will celebrate even if they finish barely at 16th, since compared to their performances in real life, such a position is almost impossible.

The easy ones are placing first or last. You could be asked to finish in second or third, which requires watching the competitors closely and screwing up inputs to keep in pace with them.

Meanwhile, the one ending up just below the "winners" get the consolation prize, either a rare permanent item or a large stack of otherwise coveted items (unidentified runes, sugary candy, treasure, etc).

If you win, you gain a fair amount of money-type items (that are available in many other places too). If you don't win, you gain "Second Chances", powerful items that let you retry failed challenges. If you come in second place, you gain some money items (not as much as first place) <em>and also</em> the Second Chances. This means coming second place will often be much more desirable than first.

Savvy players may intentionally aim for the minigame's second place because the Force Stealer can be bought for 2,200 Gil soon after in North Corel, whereas you will need to wait until reaching Cosmo Canyon to buy HP Plus for 8,000 Gil. Also, HP Plus needs tons of AP to level up, so it helps getting it in Junon to start grinding for it earlier on.

Pyro won, and with the Jungle Inferno update, the class received four weapons... all of which are, for one reason or another, of questionable utility. Meanwhile, the Heavy received as a "consolation" prize the Second Banana, a powerful lunchbox item that's equally as useful as the fan-favorite Sandvich.

However, the tortoise manages to impress Rainbow Dash by being the only pet to stop and help her when a rock slide causes her wings to get pinned under a heavy boulder. So even though the tortoise ends up dead last, Rainbow declares him the winner on the grounds that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">she said earlier</a> that the winner would be the one who crossed the finish line with her.
</li><li> In "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000", Applejack and her family take on a cider-making contest with two brothers and their cider making machine. Despite the Flim Flam brothers looking like they will win, the Apples <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">refuse to compromise the quality of their product</a> and end up losing. However, due to the brothers' rush for quantity, they sent their <em>quality</em> down the tubes and ruined their own plans after none of the ponies would buy their bad cider, proving the Apples' integrity the right way to go.
</li><li> Rainbow Dash's hopes of a world record as part of a special task given to Ponyville's Pegasi are finished before they begin in "Hurricane Fluttershy" due to several ponies she needs falling sick. However, Rainbow perseveres and they complete the task they set out to do, despite having to abort getting the record.
</li><li> Played with in "Brotherhooves Social", which also features the Sisterhooves Social event. Big Macintosh - a stallion who disguises himself as female cousin Orchard Blossom - completely steamrolls the competition and wins him and Apple Bloom first place... only to have wrecked the course and get disqualified on top of being outed for his disguise, which gives second place the victory. However, when Apple Bloom confronts Big Macintosh for his actions, he and Apple Bloom have one of the series' most heartwarming heart-to-heart conversations about how he wants to be seen as a hero again when he feels Applejack has taken the spotlight as one of the heroes of Equestria. Apple Bloom confirms and consoles her big brother, and the two's relationship is better than ever.

It helps that Ponyville still had the highest medal count at the end, and Rainbow Dash had accepted from the start that beating the Wonderbolts was a long shot.

This does not win the game — indeed, the game is so lopsided that it's been long over — but the fact that they scored at all is a humongous victory, breaking a long string of shutouts against their unstoppable rivals.

To settle things they have a contest between two robots they built, which eventually devolves into a straight up fight. Even though Pearl ultimately loses, she demonstrates her engineering talents to the other Crystal Gems, who already believed in her, and to Peridot, who eventually acknowledges Pearl's abilities and agrees to work side by side with her.

The game in question was a scavenger hunt played by teams of five. First prize was a pool table, second prize was a pizza. When the team consisting of Bluke and the four main characters get second place, the main four are disappointed, but Bluke isn't, and says that the pizza is actually the better prize out of the two. Why? Because a pizza can be easily shared between five people, but a pool table can't. We then see the winning team arguing bitterly about which one of them gets to keep the pool table in their house and how they're going to divide up its use between them.

To Charlie Brown's confusion, Peppermint Patty tells he did great since in the decathlon, he is running against tables that evaluate performance on points. In this case, the winner, Freddie Fabulous, ran such a fast race that all the competitors got good points, which means even Charlie Brown got off to a good start in the competition.

He is utterly devastated and nobody cares to point this fact out in the aftermath (the best Linus can think of when he attempts to give Charlie a speech to lighten him up is to point out that, yeah, he became an embarrassment to all of his friends because he lost... but still, "the world didn't come to an end").

The current reigning champion has been on the show for <em>months</em>, and just as Arthur is about to give the winning answer in the final round, he realises that he's good enough to keep winning and potentially get stuck doing the show <em>forever</em>. He lets his opponent win, happily takes the consolation prize (a year's supply of chocolate from the show's sponsors), and is given a hero's welcome by his classmates.

Lisa declares her refusal to do so in front of the entire audience, so when she does genuinely misspell a word, she ends up with nothing.

<ul><li> The Iditarod Dog Sled Race in Alaska takes racers from Anchorage to Nome. The first person to make it to the halfway checkpoint on the trail receives a cash prize, but becomes ineligible for the larger cash prize for reaching the finish line first. Some racers decide to let an opponent reach the checkpoint first, then try to win the First Place prize. It also has a prize for finishing dead last, a red lantern. Rick Reilly once wrote an essay about a completely hopeless, luckless entrant who actually intended to win the lantern to show to his kids and was disappointed when he learned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">he finished ahead of two other teams</a>. The Tour de France bicycle race uses the same term for the racer who comes in last place (<em>La lanterne rouge</em>), although there is no actual prize other than the notoriety.
</li><li> Philosopher Søren Kierkegaard came from a very disciplined household. When he proved to consistently be the best student in his classes, his father feared the boy would become complacent and arrogant in his superiority, so he charged Søren with the considerably harder task of getting the second-highest scores in all of his classes. Which Søren did.
</li><li> Some rural parts of Germany have a tradition of holding a yearly <em>Schützenfest</em>, where the men of the village have a shooting competition. The winner has to throw a party for the whole village. Usually, who will win this year is agreed upon beforehand, and the rest are competing for second place.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em>, there seems to be an unspoken rule that it's <em>better</em> to come in the top ten, but not the top two; such singers still have a chance to be picked up by a record label, but not sign their souls away to 19 Entertainment (the company behind American Idol), and thus have more creative control over their careers.
<ul><li> Technically, 19 Entertainment has "right of first refusal" over all contestants who make the Top 10, meaning that no other label can sign a contestant for a set period of time. (This is to prevent losing contestants from cashing in on their micro-celebrity to sell units for a different record label.) However, making the Top 10 ensures a slot on the post-show concert tour (which pays well) and many contestants that <em>are</em> signed by 19 Entertainment do well without the "American Idol" label, as they have more time to put out a first single,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2956h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2956h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2956h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They won't be allowed to compete with the winner's debut single from the finale.</span> arguably more freedom over their artistic identity (particularly if the contestant is better at a genre other than pop), and faux-"authenticity." Chris Daughtry was immediately signed upon being eliminated and has outsold that season's winner, Taylor Hicks.
</li></ul></li><li> As with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel">America's Next Top Model</a></em> contestants often do better finishing anywhere outside of first. Fan theory holds that the contestant eliminated in third place is the most likely to be successful, as CoverGirl (the show's longest-running sponsor) cares less about "actual model potential" than protecting their image. As the show has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">declined and become increasingly campy</a>, former contestants take the risk of being turned down due to "guilt by association," so being unmemorable is a good strategy.
</li><li> Anecdotal evidence suggests that making the second place prize worth more is a common tool used by adults to manage arrogant children. This may be a cultural (Eastern European / Russian) thing. The first place is taken by the talented kids, for whom the contest was not enough of a challenge. The second place is for the hard-working kids, i.e. socially approved winners. Therefore the first prize is a poster to put on a wall (among many others), the second prize is a field trip (likely to be one and only).
</li><li> During the 2012 Olympics, there was a match between two tennis players: world #1 Novak Djokovic and world #2 Andy Murray. In their previous meetings Djokovic had comprehensively beaten Murray almost every time, but at the Olympics he seemed strangely off his game. He lost the match and left the Olympics, while Murray went on to win a gold medal. Some viewers couldn't help but suspect that Djokovic threw the match (or just didn't try) in order to get himself eliminated as soon as possible and return to professional competition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">which pays much better</a>. In a subversion, though, Murray went on to beat Djokovic again at the very next Grand Slam (the US Open) a few weeks later, and would beat him yet again at Wimbledon the following year.
<ul><li> Both a subversion and deliberate invocation of this trope at the London Olympics happened with four Asian badminton teams. They played to intentionally lose a match in order to have a better shot of winning in the next round. They were all summarily disqualified.
</li><li> Several other athletes also deliberately threw or purposely didn't give it their all in order to focus on events they specialized in. It all came to a head when in the Track and Field event, a French and Algerian runner didn't try their hardest in order to focus on their specialist events, and only the Algerian was initially disqualified under the "fair play" rule, and the British track cycling team crashed crashed on purpose to take advantage of a loophole. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Only the non-white athletes were subject to scrutiny under the "honest effort" rules.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2016 Olympics, American gymnast Aly Raisman took second place in the women's all-around. Between the fact that it was a huge improvement on her 2012 results in the same event (where she lost the bronze in a tiebreaker) and the fact that she knew going in that she had basically no chance of catching her teammate Simone Biles<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jmls');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3jmls" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jmls');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Biles, widely considered the greatest female gymnast of all time, hadn't lost an all-around competition in over three years</span>, Raisman's reaction to her silver was equivalent to how most gymnasts react to winning gold.
</li><li> Some American colleges aggressively recruit students whose standardized test scores place them in the 80th to 90th percentile. These applicants are more likely to be offered scholarships and "honors" programs than applicants who max out in all categories. Some of this is practicality — students with test scores far above the school's average are likely to be offered admission to a more competitive school, so it's unlikely they'll be swayed into attending — while some of it is a psychological gamble: schools assume that students who do well but not perfectly are diligent workers prepared to take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">hard work</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">that is university scholastics</a>. For schools looking to increase their competitiveness, the best move is to offer heavy rewards to all "second place" candidates, as their average and median scores and GPAs will create an entry class with a great statistical profile. Playing this strategy every year is how schools outside of the top tier raise their ranking. Of course, since the tacit assumption is that "second place" students only came in second place due to hard work <em>and</em> some kind of ability cap (such as simply not being as good at taking the SAT as someone with a perfect score), this can also backfire. For many smart students, percentile rankings and GPA are easy achievements, and it's possible to be highly ranked without applying effort or developing study habits — causing this trope to backfire spectacularly. Grade inflation, lack of test anxiety, elimination of stereotype threat, and the knowledge of "what the test is testing" are all in play. Since the drinking age in America is 21 but many universities are hotbeds of underage drinking, students used to placing in the 85th+ percentile without breaking a sweat often encounter ... difficulty ... when forced to budget their own time.
</li><li> While technically second or even middle of the road academically, a lot of schools like students that do extracurricular activities and still maintain a decent but not perfect GPA. It means they're well rounded and can handle college, which often puts them into situations that they need to do more than school. Harvard College in particular has gone on record as saying it likes students who are very well-rounded or very "well-lopsided." In other words, you've got a shot if you have a stellar academic record but not very much outside of that <em>or</em> if you have a middling academic record but a variety of out-of-classroom accomplishments.
</li><li> After disastrous performances in virtually every single competition he ever entered, figure skater Paul Wylie skated the best performance of his life (and many would say, of the night) and won an Olympic silver medal at the 1992 Albertville Games. Considering that he wasn't expected to win anything at all, it was pretty remarkable.
</li><li> The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858. Abraham Lincoln competed in a series of debates with Stephen Douglas, mainly over the topic of slavery, and these debates would decide which of them would be made Illinois' United States Senator (back then, US Senators were not elected by the general public, but by the state legislatures). Technically, Lincoln was considered the loser of the debates; he lost the resulting election but ended up gaining a national reputation. This momentum allowed Lincoln to win the US presidency in 1860, defeating other opponents - including the aforementioned Douglas!
</li><li> The Dutch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football team</a> that lost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">The World Cup</a> in 1974 is still fondly remembered as one of the best teams ever.

On the decisive game against hosts West Germany, they got a penalty kick <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsnK_4IWBWc">one minute in without the Germans touching the ball<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. Then good old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">Germanic Efficiency</a> trumped the "Clockwork Orange", who lost 2-1.
</li><li> The South Korean team for the 2002 FIFA World Cup ended the tournament in fourth place, but was celebrated as if they had won the whole thing. This was because the Korean team had never gotten past the first round in any previous World Cup and most Koreans were hoping that the team would at least make it to the second round. Manager Guus Hiddink was then showered with honors and perks (including honorary Korean citizenship, free first-class flights for life, and a luxury villa) for helming the team to this unprecedented success.
</li><li> The NFL Draft has "Mr. Irrelevant." The final pick in the draft is treated to a one-week trip to Newport Beach, California, complete with golfing, regatta, a roast in his honor, and the "Lowsman Trophy". This became such a prestigious honor that one year two teams <em>passed the next-to-last pick</em> to try and get Mr. Irrelevant, forcing a rule change so that the draft would end already.
</li><li> In 2015, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> player Pascal Maynard made the top 8 finals of the largest Grand Prix tournament in the game's history. In the top 8 draft (where each player takes a card from a booster pack and passes the rest on), he was building a solid red/white build, he opened his second pack to reveal a foil <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/mm2/en/165.html">Tarmogoyf<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which was worth $500 on the secondary market, but would not have fit his deck over the Burst Lightning that was also in the pack. He took the 'Goyf anyway. He would lose in the semifinals, but the publicity (both positive and negative) he got for picking the card enabled him to sell it on eBay for nearly $15,000... nearly four times what the winner of the tournament won in prize money. He gave half the proceeds to charity.
</li><li> In December 2013, at <em>Frosty Faustings VI</em>, Chicago's 2nd largest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">fighting game</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay">tournament</a>, a bit of controversy arose during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronophantasma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronophantasma">Chronophantasma</a></em> Grand Finals. The two players, who happened to be brothers, made it into the grand finals set playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetFighter">Carl</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Platinum</a> throughout the entire event. Upon reaching Grand Finals, the brothers intended to split the prize money, and because of that, they both opted to play as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Izayoi</a> instead of their main characters. When asked by the tournament organizer if this selection was merely a button check, they replied saying that it was indeed an actual match, and admitted to colluding. Shinsyn, the tournament organizer, decided to put his foot down, and had the two brothers play out the grand finals set using their actual characters. As a result of the collusion, the tournament organizer penalized the two finalists by taking away the pot bonuses, (originally intended for 1st and 2nd place), and awarded them to the 3rd place winner, whom he felt fought the hardest out of everyone who competed in the tournament. The 3rd place winner was given an extra $500 in pot bonuses.
</li><li> A Lotto New Zealand draw in September 2018 saw the winning numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and the bonus number 36. As a result, 40 people won First Division (all six winning numbers), splitting the $1 million prize pool to receive $25,000 each. There were five winners in Second Division (five numbers and the bonus), splitting the $137,155 prize pool to win $27,841 each, meaning Second Division winners won more money that the First Division winners!
</li><li> As a result of how the fixtures in the 2018 FIFA World Cup had been arranged before the draw, the final round of Group G games saw Belgium take on England<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note493q4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note493q4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note493q4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">both teams had won their two previous matches, so they had both qualified for the knockout stages</span>. It was seen that whoever won this game would have a tougher path to the Final than the loser,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5k4nj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5k4nj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5k4nj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the winner would have four of the top seven teams in the world in their draw, compared to two of the top ten on the losers side</span> a fact reflected by both teams fielding weakened teams. It was ultimately subverted, as both teams would be knocked out in the Semifinals.
</li><li> In alpinist circles climbing the second highest mountain on each continent is considered a bigger achievement than climbing the highest. This is mostly due to the infamously lethal K2 being the second highest peak in Asia and the tallest mountains of Africa (Kilimanjaro) and South America (Aconcauga) having routes that can be ascended by just trekking, with zero climbing equipment.
