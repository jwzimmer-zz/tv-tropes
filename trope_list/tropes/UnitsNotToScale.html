Also, in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyGame">strategy games</a>, infantrymen are ridiculously large when compared to vehicles and buildings. The difference in scale is particularly noticeable when dealing with transports that can carry multiple infantry, and it's very rare that an aircraft carrier will appear large enough to contain more than a handful of aircraft.

It can be easier to keep track of everything from a bird's eye view when each unit you can select is within a limited size range. Rendering every unit to scale would require either a very zoomed-out viewpoint that would make small units too difficult to see, or a close-up viewpoint that would make large units too big to fit onscreen. Also, you can't really stop at just making aircraft carriers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> proportionately bigger than one foot soldier; you'd need to create appropriately giant oceans, mountains, and plains just to preserve the sense of realism, as well as give those behemoths enough space to move around in. It's much simpler to just declare that each tile represents however many miles square, and that whatever unit occupies that tile won't necessarily be drawn to scale.

However, it will probably remain a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>, since it can be a hassle to have to constantly zoom in and out in order to command efficiently. In practice, even strategy games that downplay this trope at least use it to the extent that you can still micromanage a battle from a single zoom setting. Board games and Tabletop games are further constrained by the fact that you can only make physical game pieces so small before they become inconvenient to manipulate, or make the board so large before you can no longer play the game on a tabletop. Just imagine how impractical playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk">Risk</a></em> would be if the board representing the world map was gigantic enough to match the scale of the soldier pieces, or if each of those pieces didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks">represent a whole army</a>!

<ul><li> Heroes are all roughly the same size as each other. Take Sgt. Hammer, who rides around in a scaled-down tank. When she opens the hatch, her actual body would barely come up to most heroes' knees. Azmodan one of the largest heroes, but a far cry from being the size of a mountain as he was in his home universe. Ditto for Ragnaros. Even Deathwing, whose whole gimmick is that he's the biggest playable hero, still is small enough to traverse the map in any spot.

Raynor can call piloted airships as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones">Attack Drones</a>, but those ships are smaller than him (which means their pilots are even smaller).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII">Age of Empires III</a></em> deserves special mention. Transport ships can carry a truly ridiculous number of ground units, since unlike the previous games its bases carrying capacity on unit stacks, rather than individual units. Screw science vessels, you can carry a dozen Heavy Cannon (horses included) across islands in one trip. <em>In a canoe</em>.
<ul><li> On the other hand, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII">Age of Empires III</a></em> was notable in this regard for having impressively ginormous ships, particularly frigates and monitors, which seem closer to proper scale than previous incarnations in the series and the genre in general.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresII">Age of Empires II</a></em> was bad about the scale of Transport Ships to some of its units. The Persian War Elephants and the Korean War Wagons, in particular, appear almost the size of Transport Ships themselves, yet ten of either can fit in a ship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresI">Age of Empires</a></em> had this the most in terms of pure object scale, particularly for houses: since buildings stay the same size through the ages, a Stone Age hut the size of a child will be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zoolander">mansion for ants</a> by the Iron Age. Most buildings look not much taller than a normal unit, and even Wonders such as the Coliseum are only slightly higher than elephants. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> given the much smaller screen resolutions of the day.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology">Age of Mythology</a></em> can fit around 20 elephants in a small tent around the size of a medium sized room being carried by a giant roc. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">On the other hand, the bird is only attainable when worshiping a specific god...</a>
<ul><li> Better yet, there are certain siege units that can garrison units. You can then garrison these siege units into transport ships!
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnnoDomini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnnoDomini">Anno Domini</a></em> series started out with a really bad case of this, but became progressively better with every instalment. <em>Anno 1503</em>, for instance, had the town's denizens reach up to the first story of their houses (ratio 2:1), and the ships were only about three or four times the size of the wooden docks at which they were docking (making them much smaller in comparison with the citizens, of whom only a handful could fit onto one such ship). Hell, even the <em>military unit</em> sprites were a little smaller and thinner than the civilian models, due to them being manually controled by the player, yet they were barely shorter than the city's stone walls. <em>1701</em>, which was its 3d successor, had exactly the same problems. By the time <em>1404</em> came along, however, the ratio between the houses, civilians and soldiers was finally cleared up in a realistic manner. The ships, on the other hand...
</li><li> Also notable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> IV</em>, where it is possible to zoom in on your cities to see the various buildings and wonders you've created there... and any garrisoned units, towering high above even the tallest of buildings. If you happen to build the Colossus of Rhodes, it's interesting to note that he's effectively a miniature next to the actual soldiers.
<ul><li> Closer to aversion in <em>Civilization V</em>, though. Units are still numerically smaller, with physically larger soldiers, than reality by a huge proportion, but it's a smaller huge proportion — twenty pikemen who together take up one tile, instead of three pikemen who tower over cities.
</li><li> In all <em>Civilization</em> games, it's taken as read that virtually all units are not really the soldiers or tanks or planes or whatever themselves but a representation of a large group of them. The three "Riflemen" of <em>IV</em> or twenty of <em>V</em> (or one of <em>III</em>) are all taken to represent a division or a brigade of rifles, and ditto with the cavalry and tanks, and a single "Jet Fighter" is understood to be a squadron or wing of planes. The only real exception is probably the naval vessels, which probably are supposed to represent a single vessel (at least from the late Renaissance onward), so the vast difference in scale really is just a matter of being able to see the thing. In some of the games, this is even acknowledged with a statistic that expresses the size of the player's military in a fairly realistic fashion. It can be surreal to get told that your five or six units actually represent an army in the tens of thousands that could probably sack and burn all but the best-defended cities of the era, or that your city's population of 20 actually represents a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCity">Mega City</a> with millions of inhabitants.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">Egregious</a> example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a>: Red Alert,</em> where infantry are about the same size the light tank or APC (which can, of course, hold five of said infantry). Some levels in the campaign actually take place inside buildings which, if infantry were the same size inside and out, it would be theoretically possible to build an entire base in the <em>hallways</em> of that building.
<ul><li> It gets even weirder in the mission packs, as some of the indoor missions feature TANKS and PILLBOXES, and others DO build a base inside, featuring refineries and Chronospheres.
</li><li> In the newer installments of the Tiberian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>, where infantry units are more or less to scale with vehicles (however, buildings are still ridiculously small when compared to units and terrain: GDI barracks are the size of a large tent, their vehicle factory resembles a tiny car repair shop and the NOD temple is no larger than a one-bedroom home).
<ul><li> It's hilarious when you build a GDI Juggernaut. It's taller than the factory that builds it, so it has to crouch and be pushed out since it's a walker and cannot walk when crouching. The crouching juggernaut is so big one wonders how the factory had enough room in it for the equipment needed to build it in the first place.
</li><li> The GDI and Nod buildings are mostly underground as shown in Renegade.
</li><li> The Mammoth MKII in Tiberian Sun goes even. In actual gameplay, it doesn't appear much bigger than, say, two APCs stacked, but in two <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FMVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FMVs">FM Vs</a> featuring it, living up to its name, it's fucking gigantic. It's well over a hundred feet tall, in terms of width is nearly as big as a construction yard (which is much larger than it is in gameplay).
</li></ul></li><li> Also, compare the size of ships. In Generals and Tiberium Wars, warships are very large, almost to scale (The GDI aircraft carrier you can see in a few Missions in Tiberium Wars is about the size of a small base itself). However, these are stationary and unplayable objects in campaign mode. Meanwhile, the <em>Red Alert</em> series has warships that can be built and controlled by the player, and the largest ships are at best twice the size of a heavy tank.
<ul><li> Which lead to the somewhat amusing sight of being able to shove 5 Soviet Mammoth Tanks into a transport half the size of one.
</li></ul></li><li> This also carried over to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> spinoff <em>Renegade</em>. While the buildings are fairly realistic in size in the singleplayer campaign, they are quite tiny in multiplayer (either scaled down 40% or <em>to</em> 40%), possibly because they would take too much space on the maps otherwise (and be too confusing to navigate inside).
<ul><li> This can be jarring, since a building that is practically a level in itself in single player contains exactly one small room in multiplayer.
</li><li> The size of the Multiplayer arena also had the problem of being hilariously tiny. Namely in one of the shipped maps, the area between bases is so small it was barely a courtyard.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireAtWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireAtWar">Empire at War</a></em> and its expansion are chock full of this. Walkers (such as the AT-ST and AT-PT) barely larger than your average infantryman, fighters being the size of an Imperial Star Destroyer's bridge tower, the Victory-class being only around the length of a canonically much smaller Acclamator for some reason, the list goes on. Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">mods</a> go out of their way to scale units much more accurately in all but the most extreme cases (like Executor, which would take up the entire map if brought to its proper size). This one mostly comes down to the fact that, were they at their full scale, you would either have Star Destroyers filling up the screen or fighters being a swarm of indistinct dots. It even applies to planets, which utilize forced perspective to look larger than they are; go into the "Cinematic" camera and watch that perspective immediately evaporate, with planets even at the most judicious scaling being about ten miles wide.
</li><li> The RTS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireEarth">Empire Earth</a></em> is horrible scale-wise. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> from the future ages are Humongous only in name. A miner is bigger than a tank, and nuclear bomber fighter jets are smaller than their bombs. The bombs are smaller than most <em>tanks</em>.
<ul><li> And lets not get into EE2's Prophet unit. It's a guy wearing a sign that can summon volcanoes, hurricanes, tornadoes etc. He is bigger than the volcano's crater.
</li></ul></li><li> The Terran Science Vessel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftI">Starcraft</a></em> is a medium sized unit, but one level of the Zerg campaign is set inside one such vessel, which features several spaces in which it seems one could fit buildings that are much larger than the unit is. (With some creative use of cheat codes, or the map editor, it would indeed be possible to insert well over a hundred Science Vessels unit into the Science Vessel map.)
<ul><li> Don't even <em>mention</em> the Battlecruisers. It seems that capital ships are to scale with buildings. The top of the Terran Starport even looks like a to-scale battlecruiser dry-dock.
<ul><li> Supposedly battlecruisers are 560 meters long, in comparison to command centers which are supposedly 3 by 3 stories (about 12 meters) but in game look much bigger. Though that might explain where the starting buildings come from in the second game's campaign missions (except the starports).
</li><li> And then in a cutscene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIHeartOfTheSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIHeartOfTheSwarm">Starcraft II Heart Of The Swarm</a></em>, a battleship makes a crash landing in Korhal, and it seems to be about half as big as the city it lands on. Even at the angle it impacts it still extends past the clouds (admittedly, that scene was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>, so proportions might have been distorted).
</li></ul></li><li> Adding to scale oddities, from what can be determined from the game's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FMVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FMVs">FM Vs</a>, the Battlecrusier's are actually smaller than the science vessels. However, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardGame">Board Game</a>, the Science Vessel is smaller than Marines and Zerglings.
</li><li> Most of the other units have identical scaling to each other as they did in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>, excepting the Ultralisk, which is the size of a Thor now.
</li><li> Also a Dropship is <em>significantly</em> smaller than a Siege Tank, but still can take two onboard. This is especially funny when a small fleet of dropships arrives and starts dishing out tanks until there is no place for them, while dropships are barely visible.
</li><li> The game plays hob with distance scale, too. It's apparent in the original game, and very clear in gameplay videos of the 3D sequel, that the air units only hover perhaps ten feet above the battlefield, whereas in-game references and cutscenes show them spending most of their time <em>in orbit</em>.
</li><li> Which is why you can repair a battlecruiser (air unit) with an SCV (ground unit). Meanwhile you can blow away the battlecruiser with anti-air but not the SCV. Relative speeds are also out of whack, so you can shoot down a hypersonic fighter by having a ground creature spit acid on it, the supposedly huge starbase-shaped science vessel is one of the fastest units in the game and the hovering high templar is slower than both a normally walking marine <em>and</em> a normally walking zealot of the same race.
</li><li> The most common, yet least noticeable, is the SCV. In-game, it looks like construction-oriented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a>, about the same size as the seven-foot-tall Marines/Marauders/Firebats. They're actually <em>huge</em> compared to Marines, that glass windshield <a class="urllink" href="http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/unit/scv">is in fact the cockpit.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII">Starcraft II</a></em>, it gets even worse: the Thor is a Terran <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> that looks appropriately huge compared to a Marine. When airlifted by a Medivac dropship, the ship can only carry one at a time, as they are fixed underneath the ship like a helicopter carrying a container twice its size. Some playing around in the editor reveals that dropships are about twice the size of a bus compared to a Marine. And then there's the Odin, which in-game is slightly bigger than the Thor, but is too big to be carried by a huge-ass cargo that can carry <em>three Thors</em>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> has a really weird meta example: during mission briefings, characters on the realistically-scaled <em>Hyperion</em> observe the combat situation on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Planetville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Planetville">planet-of-the-mission</a>... which uses gameplay footage with the RTS scale. Although his is cleared up somewhat in <em>Heart of the Swarm</em>, where the <em>Hyperion</em> has nearly twice the tonnage of a regular battlecruiser when you control them side-by-side. On the other hand the fluff claims that modern <em>Gorgon</em>-class battlecruisers are larger than outdated <em>Behemoth</em>s like the <em>Hyperion</em>, though it has been extensively modified.
</li><li> The Zerg Leviathan attacks with tentacles that look narrower than a zergling, the Heart of the Swarm mission "Conviction" suggests those tentacles are <em>Nydus Worms</em>, one of the Zerg "buildings". Cutscenes and in-game pictures reveal Leviathans to be many, many times larger than a Battlecruiser.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Very obvious in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> 3</em>, where pretty much every unit in the game doesn't appear to fit in the doors on their buildings. The hero units are pretty much always bigger than almost any other unit...
<ul><li> This is also used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> to make instance and raid bosses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">stand out from the crowd</a>. Certain items also change the size of the player characters, making them unable to enter buildings.
<ul><li> Although it also applies to a lot of the architecture and objects as well. While it may be understandable that a Titan dungeon has doors that tower over the heroes, it gets a little silly when you realize that a single shelf and accompanying books on a bookshelf in a night elven inn are taller than a night elf.
</li></ul></li><li> The lack of scale in WC3 is especially obvious with units that are used for transport can fit units larger than themselves inside. Creative use of the Unit Editor can allows one to fit an infinite number of units inside a transport (by making transports than can go inside transports).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em>, all units are the same size on the map, and are even animated the same size (human-sized units are sometimes, but not always, an exception), even if some mecha on your force are a mere 10 meters tall and one may be over a kilometer and a half. It's particularly obvious when your entire army launches from a battleship that appears smaller than they are, or when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a> is able to cut the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">Z-Master</a> in two.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> has a tendency to use smaller battle sprites for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobot">Real Robots</a> than for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robots</a>, but the trope still applies. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Super Robot Wars Z</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OvermanKingGainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OvermanKingGainer">King Gainer's</a> sprite is half the size of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daitarn3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daitarn3">Daitarn 3</a>'s sprite, but Daitarn 3 is actually supposed to be about <em>ten</em> times taller than King Gainer. Maybe even eleven times.
</li><li> Averted in the 3D <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsNEO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsNEO">Super Robot Wars NEO</a></em> for the Wii, where the units are shown to scale, at least on the map screens.
</li><li> The rampant amount of this that would be required is likely the reason for the usual style the units are depicted in being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a>.
<ul><li> As of about Original Generations the style has switched to more stylized SD that in addition to looking more like their full sized depictions also have clear size distinctions in the unit sizes. Notably 2L sized units which encompass everything from Battleships up to the occasional planet sized monsters (2L basically means really really big and has a wide range so they don't need to make up a size distinction for said occasional planet sizers) barely fit on the screen.
</li><li> Less noticable are the actual mecha sizes, all of which are represented at the same height, which is pretty egregious since some series, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, feature 5 meter mechs, some, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, feature 20 meter mechs, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> features 40 meter mechs.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamGGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamGGeneration">SD Gundam G Generation</a></em>, which has a few aversions. The spinoff game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GundamExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GundamExpandedUniverse">Gundam SEED: Generation of C.E.</a></em> uses full-scale machines for combat FMVs, but on the map they still take up one space each. The games starting around <em>G Generation Spirits</em> have battleships take up multiple map spaces, and even marks off critical parts of the ships like the bridge and launch catapults.
</li><li> Prior to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a> Prophecy</em>, the ship types in the <em>Wing Commander</em> series weren't proportionate to one another at all, leaving one wondering how you could stuff 100+ fighters in such a tiny carrier, if one wasn't quick enough to apply the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">MST3K Mantra</a>.
</li><li> Prominent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth">Battle for Wesnoth</a></em> - units are the same size as villages, which are represented as single houses the same size as mountains, trees and mushrooms. Large units such as dragons and Woses (tree-men) are little bigger than small units such as goblins. A motto of <em>BfW's</em> designers is HAPMA (Hexes Are Possibly Miles Across,) meaning that they vary greatly in scale, and that units can represent squads of 10s or hundreds, or single individuals, again depending on circumstance.
<ul><li> Since the game is open source, this trope has caused some conundrums among its sprite artists as they attempt to keep the game's different races and units to some sort of scale with each other. The urge to squeeze more detail into a sprite, especially once the engine supported oversized sprites that extend outside a hex, has lead to an arms race of "Creeping Biggerism" as the sprites of <em>supposedly</em> small units like dwarves and elves grow larger than that of trolls and cavalry.
</li></ul></li><li> Given the ship-to-planet size ratio in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>, either the destroyers (the <em>smallest</em> ship class with about 100 crewmen) are each about as large as Madagaskar or the planets are just small, terraformed moons. Either way, the scale is <em>way</em> out of whack (though it must be argued that having a realistic size would probably not be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">very fun, given its ways of handling combat</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that destroyers are about 30 meters in length (i.e. smaller than a <em>Space Shuttle</em>), and each subsequent class is 3x as large as the one before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em> has fairly large buildings, large enough for some races to have trouble building complete bases on certain maps. Transports, however, are distinctly Clown Car-ish, mostly because units are transported by squads instead of individually: The Imperial Guard Chimera can hold up to <em>42</em> soldiers in some expansions; in others it holds a mere 28. Other races can manage maybe 20-30 depending on squad sizes and the number of transport slots.
<ul><li> This trope is especially obvious in some cutscenes (which uses the same models as the game itself), with one featuring a character clearly being taller than the vehicle that transports him while another has a Space Marine (a three-metre-tall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a>) being smaller than a normal human. This was in fact such a common complaint that the sequel has vehicles scaled far more realistically compared to infantry, with the inevitable result that each side can only effectively deploy three or four vehicles at any one time.
<ul><li> It should also be pointed out that in DoW 2, the units are more or less perfectly to scale... With their tabletop counterparts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">This was a point of pride</a> for the designers.

Your units are never much larger than a guy on a horse, but depending on the mission they may take up as much space on the map as a house.
<ul><li> The scale also changes completely between being outside and being inside. For example, archers are usually restricted to a range of two spaces, which results in them shooting at things from very far away when outside, but only shooting a few meters at best when inside. Particularly strange when you seize a castle on an outdoor map, where it looks to be about the size of a bungalow, and then transition to an indoor map where you have to take the throne, and the castle is now large enough to contain two entire armies with room to spare.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em> is pretty much universally assumed in the fanbase to have the old "the guy you see is actually a unit of troops" interpretation, as it's the only real way to make its plot make sense. Due to the game's setup, the soldiers you battle tend to represent the armies of cities and fortresses, if not <em>nations</em>, but appear to consist of a few dozen guys at most. The entire occupation army of Isaach numbers a little over sixty men, if you don't count reinforcements.
</li><li> <em>Path of Radiance</em> and <em>Radiant Dawn</em> were <em>a little</em> more realistic, but there is still the problem of units being taller than doors and jars that are larger than horses.

On the map, your soldiers are as large as <em>buildings.</em> Not so much on the battle screens.
<ul><li> This can be a little justified since it's not really <em>a</em> soldier, but a unit of many soldiers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations">Rise of Nations</a></em>, especially if you play the maps that represent real countries. It's possible to easily make a row of tanks from coast to coast of Japan... with a dozen tanks.
<ul><li> Zigzagged when you aren't playing on such a map. Ground units are to scale with ground units, sea with sea, and air with air, but none of the groupings are to scale with each other or with buildings.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransportTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransportTycoon">Transport Tycoon</a></em> has annoyed nitpicky players for ages with the sizes of ships and planes compared to that of trains and road vehicles. Due to the scales involved with such varying vehicles, it's unavoidable; a truck and locomotive are pretty close to each other in size, but an airplane dwarfs the locomotives in real life, something that isn't possible to do with sprites. Ships are an even bigger problem, as real life railcars are the size of the <em>shipping containers</em> carried by the ship, and there are over <em>2000</em> containers on each ship. Don't even get started on the sizes of air- and seaports.
<ul><li> And then there's the whole clown-car effect of a train 5 squares long coming out of a depot 1 square long. And Open TTD removes the length restriction on trains entirely.
</li><li> Also, each tile is more than 600km long. That means, an average house has five times more area than the republic of Ireland.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em> series is another example where rings are as large as the most powerful dragons. Also, Nagas and Giants appear the same size - but the third game's intro shows one of the former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquashedFlat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquashedFlat">Squashed Flat</a> by a latter's foot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EightRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EightRealms">8Realms</a></em>, pretty much everything just takes up one tile, whether it's a cottage or a mountain.

There is no size variation, just ASCII. This affects everything depicted by the game engine, making gems and seeds appear as big as Dwarves and elephants at the same time!
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> actually has a size statistic for its creatures but it is mostly used for internal calculations.
</li><li> Map tiles suffer from inconsistent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a> attributes that most players would never part with willingly. You can store an infinite number of rocks on a single square and an infinite number of animals in one cage. Despite that, only one creature unit stand up in a given square at any given time.
</li><li> Trees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonsaiForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonsaiForest">used to take up a single tile</a> before the DF2014 update, making them an exception to the space oddities (and, according to Toady himself, making the one-tile dragons look rather stupid). Wagons are an older exception, taking up a 3x3 chunk of space and requiring a path 3 tiles wide to reach your trade depot. Proper multi-tile creatures and engines are in the works, and the aforementioned wagon will be reworked from the ground up due to being hilariously buggy (such as vanishing off the face of the earth when "spooked" and generally acting like a severely buggy and particularly stupid creature whenever things go off the rails).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis">Europa Universalis</a> III</em> always depicts your troops in a province as a single gigantic infantryman who towers above the tallest mountains, even if it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks">actually tens of thousands of soldiers with cavalry and artillery mixed in</a>.
</li><li> Starships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarRuler">Star Ruler</a></em> are to-scale with each other, but <em>not</em> with celestial objects. A size 2500 space station (about the size of a planet) has a crew of around ~200,000. The planet it is orbiting has a population of at least ~100,000,000. The not-to-scale design is present to ensure that ships and stations are actually visible without having to zoom in constantly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForceIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForceIII">Shining Force III</a></em> is very fond of this trope. Battles either take place in normal sized buildings/towns or outside where every character is the size of a mountain. This is pretty much a staple for most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Shining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Shining">Shining</a> games.

</li><li> This was part of the problem with the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechCommander">MechCommander</a></em> in its use of sprites. Fine differentiation between unit sizes was not clear, and only extreme size differences were visible in the available scale (like say the difference between a 25-ton <em>Commando</em> and the <em>Atlas</em> that weighs four times as much). Tanks tended to blur together into a 'large and dangerous' or 'small and fast' class based solely on the size of their sprites, regardless of any individual unit's capability. The inability to immediately distinguish between light and medium or heavy and assault 'Mechs was part of what led to the use of full 3D models in the sequel, where all units are in-scale to each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ActOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ActOfWar">Act of War</a>: High Treason</em> makes a conscious effort to avert this trope. Naval units are considerably larger than land units, and the camera even zooms out when you're controlling ships to compensate for their larger size. However the scaling is still not accurate to real-life proportions, and indeed it can't be done without making the game unplayable. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1qu8x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1qu8x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1qu8x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And that's not even getting into the huge range of real-life naval weapons compared to what they are in-game.</span>

It still raises amusing scenarios such as a single planet deploying a dozen ships, each of which are larger than the planet itself, or the fact that Star Bases tend to be larger than actual stars. In addition, the ships are not in scale with each other, meaning a colony ship large enough to hold a billion colonists won't be much larger than a one-man fighter.
</li><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spellforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spellforce">Spellforce</a>, since you can use a third person view of your avatar, units are to scale.

</li><li> Pokémon also return to their Pokéball depending on their size when entering a place. For example, human sized Pokémon or smaller will follow the trainer in buildings.

The game engine models each area as an independent world affected only by scripted module variables and the things inside the area itself, with doors serving as connections, meaning that depending on what you do with the door settings you can have a hovel lead anywhere from "generic hovel interior with a generic peasant in it" to "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>'s chambers" to "test area you only put in to look at some appearances and never got around to deleting". In the area tileset itself, a lot of buildings have generic interior tiles on the City Interior set and generic exterior tiles on the appropriate exterior set - but the "interior" ones tend to be about four times larger than the "exterior" structure. In the same game, there's Klauth: canonically, he's a Great Wyrm red dragon, which should make him Colossal-size and well over a hundred feet long from nose to tail.

Humanoid Primal Beasts are a victim of this, as they are supposed to be giants in-lore, but have their artworks <em>zoomed-out</em> in-game.

<ul><li> Corrected in <em>Sim City 4</em>, where the FAQs explicitly state that the length a tile is 16 meters.

Space Marines are supposed to be 7 foot tall supermen clad in power armor (which the sheer bulk would make them almost 8 feet in height) whereas Guardsmen are average and, quite frequently, malnourished conscripts, putting them at a maximum height of around 6 feet. Miniature wise, both are identical in height. This applies to the vehicles too. If the Leman Russ was in correct scale with the Guardsmen, every time the turret fired it would bisect the tank commander standing in the hatch.
</li><li> Historical wargames are sometimes forced to invoke this for realistic gameplay. A unit of troops might, for instance, represent a brigade of French infantry from the Napoleonic wars. As such, the rules are geared to represent such a unit - that 2 inch square base with a dozen figures on is actually a large area of ground with a couple of thousand men. But that means a model farm to the same scale as the figures might accommodate the base quite comfortably, while in real life the soldiers would have had to be stacked on some form of multi-layer shelving to even try to fit in. Under-scale miniature scenery so that the 'footprint' of units and terrain is consistent is one way to deal with this.

Monsters tend to be on scale with each other, with most being around 60 meters tall. Buildings, on the other hand, are generally much smaller than they should be, with (going by monster height) a 120-meter empire state building, and a football stadium where the field barely manages 30 meters.

Medium creatures take up a single 5-foot-by-5-foot "square", going downwards they are decreasing percentages of a square, and upwards takes 2, 3 and 4 squares. However, there's large variance for what counts in each size: for instance, a 4'6" Dwarf and a 7'8" Goliath are both said to take up a single square. Thus, fluff-wise and for those who use miniatures, different creatures are quite to scale, but mechanically one entity could be twice the size of another and be considered "the same".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, each hex on the playing field is 30 meters in diameter. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">battlemech</a> miniatures - even without their stands - occupy a significant portion of each hex. While a Battlemech is huge, they are not <em>60 meters tall</em> huge; the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AS7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AS7">AS 7</a>-D Atlas, one of the taller mechs, stands around 18 meters tall. The scale is even more wonky in city maps, where a Battlemech is almost as wide as an apartment building, though the ruleset that eschews hex-based movement for free-roaming units on custom, non-grid based maps can avoid the scale issue.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a> has a tendency to make its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsNotToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsNotToScale">Animals Not to Scale</a>, which would be fine if the flavor text didn't describe them as being of a relatively accurate size. This is most noticeable with dinosaurs, such as the Tyrannosaurus, which is listed as Gargantuan in size, despite being barely longer (and a bit lighter) than the Huge sized Triceratops. The Giganotosaurus, which has its size inflated to 60 feet in length (in reality it was around 45 feet long and much lighter), still isn't large enough to justify its size of Colossal, given that it is only half the weight (17 tons) of the Gargantuan Brachiosaurus (32 tons), and much shorter in height and length to boot.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zoids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zoids">Zoids</a></em> anime has an interesting inversion. While the toyline clearly shows its scale with cockpits and pilot figurines, the Anime takes certain Zoids (notably the Ultrasaurus and Death Saurer) and makes them <em>bigger</em>, often by a few orders of magnitude.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/RobotSpirits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/RobotSpirits">Robot Spirits</a>, Soul Of Chogokin and other toylines featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> from multiple series usually have this problem by necessity due to the wildly varying sizes of different Super Robots. For example, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daitarn3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daitarn3">Daitarn 3</a>'s SOC toys are about the same size, in "real life", Mazinger is 18 meters tall while Daitarn is <em>160</em>.
<ul><li> Chogokin Classic Getter, Shin Getter, and the 2019 release of the Getter Emperor are most decidedly not to scale. Well, Classic and Shin are roughly well-proportioned in comparison to each other, but the Emperor at its smallest was roughly the size of Jupiter and only got larger over time, so its Chogokin figure's scale is much more extreme than the other Getters.
</li><li> The real winner, though, would have to be Revoltech's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> action figures. Original GL is about the same size as Tengen Toppa GL. Anybody who is at all familiar with the series should see the problem here.
<ul><li> Let's face it. It's impossible to scale <em>those</em> mechs properly. Even if Original was the size of a flea, and TTGL was somehow the size of Jupiter, that wouldn't come close.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a> has this in multiple places (A more comprehensive exploration of this can be found at the <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Scale">TFwiki's page on Scale<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>):
<ul><li> The toylines have several different "size" scales (Legends, Scouts, Deluxe, Voyagers, Leaders, Supremes, and so on). This can result in a Scout-class freight truck Transformer looking positively tiny next to a Voyager-class sports car (like Bumblebee). In particular, the Animated toyline has amusing size mismatches involving Prowl, in particular his Deluxe-class form wherein the motorcycle he transforms into is <em>larger</em> than Deluxe-sized Bumblebee's hatchback car!
</li><li> Combiner Scales: First, Combiners can be portrayed being of inconsistent size to their component robots (Menasor, who is made of sports cars and a truck, can nearly match Bruticus, who is made of military vehicles, in size; The exception is Superion, who <em>would</em> really be the size of a large building due to being made of several aircraft including a Concorde). Second, component robots in a combiner might be out-of-scale with each other (Landcross from the Victory toyline, who is made of a speedboat, a Space Shuttle, a jet fighter, two different classes of trucks, and a sports car). Third, Combiners are shown to be inconsistently large or small in portrayl (Constructicons who are smaller than Megatron combine to form a Devastator more than quadruple the Decepticon Commander's height).
</li><li> Transformer subclass scale: Micromasters and Minicons are sometimes portrayed with very inconsistent scale to regular Transformers (Some Minicons are shown to become human-scale hoverboards and motorcycles, yet their human-sized robot modes are the same size as Minicons that become small trucks, and <em>both</em> of them are portrayed as being smaller than Armada Optimus Prime <em>or</em> Armada Megatron's forearms!).
</li><li> <em>Planet</em> and <em>City</em> sized Transformers - Metroplex's massive toy is about the size of a large building or city block, but only in scale with Legends-class Transformers, and he is still out-of-scale with some of them. Unicron and Primus (as well as the guest-star Death Star/Darth Vader figure from the Star Wars Transformers crossover toyline, whose interior is completely out of scale with interior shots of the real Death Star in the films) are completely undersized compared to <em>any</em> transformer toy in production - the biggest indicator of this is that several named cities, like Iacon and Kaon, are actually modeled on Primus's body, as he turned himself into the planet Cybertron as part of his backstory, and any Transformer in scale with <em>those</em> cities as depicted would only be readily visible with a magnifying glass or microscope.
</li></ul></li><li> Fans and collectors of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirl">American Girl</a> dolls would occasionally notice this in some of their toys, namely the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.americangirl.com/shop/julie-accessories/julies-car-wash-set-f0443">VW Beetle playset<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Julie, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.americangirl.com/shop/beforever-accessories/maryellen-jukebox-cmc59">Maryellen's jukebox<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the latter of which is a glorified external speaker for an iPod or a smartphone. It's somewhat justified as any bigger would be unwieldy to ship and thus even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">ridiculously expensive</a>, though fans still feel that it could've been better proportioned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a></em> produces a number of licensed sets, the most famous of which is their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a> line. Small fighters like the X-wing or TIE Fighter are built roughly to the same scale to the pilot minifig as the movies, while larger ships are built to wildly different scales; the Millenium Falcon is slightly smaller than it should be, while the Star Destroyer and especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip">Super Star Destroyer</a> are built to <em>much</em> smaller scales. This is to maintain sanity, as a to-scale SSD would be the length of an Olympic swimming pool.
</li><li> The world of scale model building is one where issues of scale <em>absolutely</em> matter. Manufacturers are frequently called out on scale discrepancies within their kits and ranges by modellers who insist on something pretty close to perfection. It doesn't help that within the two principal modelling bands, there are anomolies which hang over from the days when different manufacturers had different ideas of what would be popular. 1:32 scale models are still there, for instance, even though the accepted standard in this range for practically all kit manufacturers and fans is 1:35. Classic kit manufacturer Airfix, in the smaller scale band, still produces a hodgepodge of kits and figures in HO/00 (approximate 1:87 scale, designed to go with model railway layouts), as well as slightly larger scales. The accepted industry yardstick here is less clearcut: it is tending now to 1:72, but many kits are still made in 1:76. Does it matter? well, yes. Take a model of the same subject in, say, 1:32 and stand it next to one in 1:35. There will be a visible scale difference. The same applies to 1:76 versus 1:72. And 1:87 is <em>definitely</em> smaller. Within each scale, however, there is generally consistency. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2oubx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2oubx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2oubx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Talking to a clued-up modeller about, say, the Airfix model of the Crusader Tank and how its dimemsions are way out of scale even within itself, and you will get a far longer and more detailed answer than it might strictly need.</span>. It's also interesting how, even in a well-scaled model, it's often bloody hard to get a pilot figure in an aircraft, or a driver/crew figure in a vehicle, to fit the given space convincingly - even though the crew space is to scale and a figure in the same scale should fit naturally!

</p><ul><li> 1944 : Battle of the Bulge gave us pretty realistic take of unit measurement, with infantry being so tiny and tanks are obviously on scale. However due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeLongRangeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeLongRangeWeapon">Short-Range Long-Range Weapon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a> rules <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">being obeyed here</a>, having your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">infantry team</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">M3 Scout</a>, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">British Churchill</a>, suddenly confront a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Tiger Tank</a> may induce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> and shocked reactions.
</li><li> Except for the infantry being approx 30 per cent bigger than real people, most of the stuff seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ActOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ActOfWar">Act of War</a></em> has a very accurate size (including warships!). The fact the game is still visually easy to play shows the amount of care the designers had to make it as realistic as possible.
</li><li> While we may recognize it was not as perfectly made as other games, lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a> fans loved the considerable amount of realism EALA put in Tiberium Wars and Kane's Wrath, with well scale-sized units and infantry squads, add to this the excellent particle, light and texture effects and you may understand why it's along with Generals the best EA C&amp;C and so many guys felt disappointed when they found Red Alert 3 and Command and Conquer 4 have gone back to cartoonish graphics and units awfully out of scale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> and its sequels tried to keep unit sizes at a sane ratio, and the typical strike craft is so incredibly small compared to carriers or larger ships that you can actually imagine everything fitting together, or at least close together. It doesn't, however, deal with resources well: you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">still fit all the necessary materials for those sixteen capital ships and four cruisers in the main base</a>, even if you can't stuff the ships back in, afterwards.
<ul><li> Another noteworthy thing is that the ships change scale with distance to the camera, so you can still see them when zoomed out fully. It's particularly conspicuous on the research ships, which overlap when zoomed out fully. There is a patch to turn this "Non-Linear Inverse Perspective Scaling" off, leaving all ships to scale at all times, whereupon it becomes difficult to select or even <strong>see</strong> your strike craft. <em>Homeworld 2</em> directly provides an option to turn NLIPS on or off.
</li><li> Also, there's the Star Wars themed HW2 mod <a class="urllink" href="http://warlords.swrebellion.com/wp/">Warlords<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which has properly scaled units, from Tie Fighters to the truly gargantuan Super Star Destroyers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em>, and to a lesser degree its unofficial spiritual source <em>Total Annihilation</em>, have no problem producing incredible size differences, largely because only one unit has an actual human inside it. The differences can be truly massive. Dozens of lower-tier human-sized or tank-sized units can fit inside the typical battleship's profile, and the experimental units are so massive that some of them can literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">crush opponents</a>.
<ul><li> It's also worth pointing out that the smallest units in SupCom are about the size of AT-STs anyway (your basic attack mecha is the size of a large pine tree). The big stuff is HUGE.
</li><li> Also noticeable is how the Transports are precisely large enough to accommodate the units they carry. Even better, you actually see the unit hanging from under the transporter. Even more satisfying, some units have enough free movement while in transport that they can shoot down at enemies below! In the SupCom community, this goes by the lingo of "Ghetto Gunships".
</li><li> It is also nice to watch as various air units clash in dogfights. Even though they're the worst scale offenders in the game, flying at a fraction of the real altitudes jet-fighters of today would do, it's still an impressive altitude of hundreds upon hundreds of meters when compared to usual RTSes. "Factory Units" that can also act as carriers too could conceivably carry all the units it does ingame.
</li><li> If you're wondering how the game handles the zoom scaling issues, SupCom doesn't even have a traditional minimap - it would quickly get too cluttered - instead allowing the main display to be zoomed all the way out to a strategic overview of the entire battlefield. As units get too small to see, they're represented by icons. The stage this happens at depends on the size of the unit - you'll see Mech Marine icons far more often than the unit model, but some Experimentals are plainly visible even at the strategic level.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>: Force Commander</em> has units that are about the size you'd expect them to be, ranging from basic infantry to AT-ATs. As a result, you <em>can't see the freaking infantry</em> without zooming in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes">Company of Heroes</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> RTS, has units that are relatively correctly scaled; at least, it is plausible that a squad of riflemen could fit inside one APC, and buildings with multiple stories are frequently seen, towering above the infantry hiding among the rubble.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndWar">EndWar</a></em> keeps units to scale, to the point where you can zoom in and see the individual soldiers that make up a platoon of riflemen die individually, or watch them pile into IFVs for transport without looking wrong at all.
<ul><li> Except for the Spetsnaz's smaller transport helicopters and their platoons of four tanks, which look unlikely to entirely fit in just one Spetsnaz transport helicopter like they do.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GroundControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GroundControl">Ground Control</a> 2</em> allows infantry to garrison inside buildings, so the buildings are scaled properly, and ground vehicles look about right, too. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip">Drop Ship</a> still has a bigger hold than its volume suggests.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImpossibleCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImpossibleCreatures">Impossible Creatures</a></em>, even size 1 creatures were larger than humans, so even a cockroach-wasp would be enormous. But in version 1.0, certain creatures (most notably ant-rats) would be size 0, letting them surround and instantly destroy large enemy creatures. Also, they could go through spaces 1 tile wide, letting them reach henchmen hiding in normally safe corners.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MenOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MenOfWar">Men of War</a></em> has every single unit in the game on a consistent scale. The heaviest tanks, like the Tiger II, IS-3, and T-29 are all freakin' enormous.
</li><li> The RTS series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> features castles so large that entire battles take place within their courtyards. Catapults and artillery are suitably many times taller than infantry, and are usually operated by 5-10 visible infantry units.
<ul><li> Except when it comes to moving armies via ship. You can fit an entire 20 unit army (anywhere from 500 to 2000 individuals) on a single small ship.
</li><li> Although the units are to scale, <em>Total War</em> does tend to fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrivingGhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrivingGhostTown">Thriving Ghost Town</a> a lot: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar">Rome: Total War</a></em>, the Eternal City can never get a population above 32000 or so, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">game-balancing reasons</a>, and none of the cities have anywhere near enough residential space. It also had issues with some fauna, like trees in Germany, being absolutely huge. And operating on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, there is a cheat that allows you to access the dreaded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">oliphants</a> that tower over any soldier or building in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarRomeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarRomeII">Total War: Rome II</a></em> is probably the most accurate yet. Cities are absolutely massive and each unit has its own transport ships to accommodate it. You can even see the troops standing on deck during the battles to show that yes, just about everything here is to scale.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldInConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldInConflict">World in Conflict</a></em> does a decent job averting this: the infantry units are represented as squads of five men, who are individually so small that you only see them as tiny specks on the screen from the tactical view. If they weren't individually highlighted with green circles like all other units in the game, the infantry players would have had trouble finding their own units again.
</li><li> <em>Combat Mission</em> averts this in a very practical way. The player controls the displayed scale with a single shortcut key. Units can be displayed realistically, or can be scaled to various constant sizes, irrespective of their distance from the camera. Thus you can scale everything up to the maximum to spot lone, camouflaged infantry at distances of several kilometers or more across the steppes, or scale everything realistically for close battles, when judging the effects of elevation, or just to enjoy the view as everything moves between command phases.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParaWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParaWorld">Para World</a></em> mostly averts this, except for the water transport units, which are ridiculously tiny relative to what they can carry (since units take up one slot therein no matter how big they are, you could fit 10 dinosaurs in a small boat. Or on a giant turtle... however that one's supposed to work.)
</li><li> Notably averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericanConquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericanConquest">American Conquest</a></em>, where barracks are indeed the size of a regiment, and you often need to zoom out to manage your fleet.
</li><li> Another impressive aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JeffWaynesWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JeffWaynesWarOfTheWorlds">Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds</a></em>, where the vehicles and buildings are in proportion, and both ships and the Martian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripodTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripodTerror">Tripod Terrors</a> are <em>huge</em>.
</li><li> The somewhat infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a>: Eternal Forces</em> RTS demonstrated why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a> in the first few levels, set in New York City where the units and buildings were largely to scale... which meant skyscrapers that jutted up and past the top-down camera, meaning there were only a few angles you could view the action from without buildings obscuring everything, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedVideoGames">among the game's other issues</a>.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role-Playing Game</a></span>
</p><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">Ultima VI</a></em>, while some inventory objects and other sprites are off-scale, the towns themselves are all part of one big continuous overworld map. The dungeons are half-scale compared with the overworld. The entrances to the dungeons on the overworld are in the exact same locations as their exits inside the dungeons.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame">Simulation Game</a></span>
</p><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> series, what with its varying objects in space, from astronauts, small ships, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip">capital ships</a>, stations and jumpgates tends to make size differences very visible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace">Freespace</a></em> (aka <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a>: Freespace</em>) is one of the only games to advertise this fact. The US cover art of the game showed a gigantic alien battleship spanning 4 pages of the fold-out over. A tiny dot was circled on the front with the caption "This is you". Players who managed to reach the final levels of the game would be surprised to find this depiction in sizes was accurate.
<ul><li> In the sequel, though, Shivan juggernauts (supposedly just under 6 kilometers long) can be picked out clearly as they orbit the Capella star, from dozens if not hundreds of millions of miles away. This seems to suggest that either the juggernauts orbiting the star are either five orders of magnitude larger than they actually are, or Capella the equivalent amount smaller than we think it is. Note that the real Capella is more than twice as massive as our own sun. The ending sequence directly contradicts this, too, showing the juggernauts near the star as being much smaller than the star itself. Based on the scale shown by that cutscene, the juggernauts really should be completely invisible from the player's point of view, hundreds of millions of miles away.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TachyonTheFringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TachyonTheFringe">Tachyon: The Fringe</a></em> also advertises its realistic scale. In the game, various sectors contain truly gigantic starbases (so massive that they often caused framerate problems), with the player's hangar being only a small opening when looking at the entire structure. It can take several minutes (even using afterburners) to fly around the thing. The same is true with cruisers and carriers, although to a much lesser extent. The problem with planet scale is solved by having the planets and moons as backgrounds.
</li><li> The incredibly awesome <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.a-astra.com/index.htm">Ad Astra<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> freeware space simulator game is also completely on scale.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon">Zoo Tycoon</a></em> mostly averts this. The animals are up to scale in comparison to the people. The buildings are also relatively large so that it doesn't really look out of place when a guest enters it.
