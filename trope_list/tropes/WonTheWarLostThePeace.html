Griffith and his Band of the Hawk win the war for Midland by recapturing the strategic fortress of Doldrey from the Tudor Empire, forcing the Empire to sue for peace on terms that give back the territory they had occupied. While this historic victory earns Griffith the gratitude of the King and the people, who look forward to a new era of rebuilding the country's prosperity, the benefits of this peace are already threatened from within by the Queen, Minister Foss, and their disgruntled noble conspirators who want to assassinate Griffith and restore the hereditary control over the military and government that they used to exercise before that common mercenary leader's rise marginalized them. Even though Griffith succeeds in eliminating this nest of vipers through counter-intrigue, he brings about his own downfall by deflowering the King's daughter, Princess Charlotte, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake">Tragic Mistake</a> he made because Guts defeated and left him in what would turn out to be his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake">Tragic Mistake</a>.

By the end of the second season, most of the veterans are dead with Simon becoming a wanderer and letting Rosseau and the survivors lead humanity.

The protagonist loses the battle of Keenset, but as an eventual result of it his "Accelerationist" viewpoint that technology should be shared wins the day over his opponents' "Deicrat" viewpoint that this is dangerous, as the battle weakens them enough that they can't maintain the same level of strict technological control as they were accustomed to.

Despite being on the brink of total military victory, the new government following an assassination accepts Saint-Just's proposed ceasefire, then drags on the "negotiations" for several years, in the process screwing up their own military, and giving the next Havenite government plenty of time to build up their military, catch up some technologically, and get good and pissed off that Manticore is stringing them along. When the war inevitably restarts, it starts with Haven at a <em>huge</em> advantage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They ultimately make peace and <em>sign a military alliance</em> thanks to the discovery of a common enemy and the most audacious diplomatic gambit ever seen in the series — and by "diplomatic gambit" we mean "the President of Haven shanghaied most of her Cabinet and paid an entirely unannounced call on the Queen of Manticore" — but not before a cataclysmic attack on the Manticore System guts both navies and leaves hundreds of thousands dead.</span>

</li><li> This is essentially what happened to Robert Baratheon after the Robert's Rebellion was over and he was crowned king of Westeros. A decent general and a great leader, but a lousy administrator and politician, it was only the outbreak of another war (the Greyjoy rebellion) that allowed Robert to actually consolidate his grasp on the throne. Control of the Seven Kingdoms slipped out of his grasp due to courtly intrigues he did nothing to rein in, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and upon his death his heir was left with only the Lannisters as allies while all the other great houses rebelled or stayed neutral.</span> To his credit, Robert recognized this about himself.

Once she settles in Meereen, she hears stories of atrocities carried out in Astapor, the first city she liberated, and realizes that Meereen is in its own state of fresh chaos. She decides to put the whole "retake the Seven Kingdoms" thing aside until she can maintain some order in her new kingdoms, first. She explicitly considers this a training run so she can get a handle on what she's going to do later; and, both as expected and as a result... things go badly. Turns out treating real people, places, and problems as simple practice for "the real thing" adds up to a lot of half-baked "solutions" primed to blow up in your face in record time.

</li><li> The Third Age prior to the main events of the books is a three-thousand year version of this. The Last Alliance defeat Sauron at the end of the Second Age, but Isildur fails to destroy the Ring, which leads to the estrangement of Elves and Men and his untimely death, which itself causes the split of Arnor and Gondor. Arnor ends up fragmenting into smaller states and slowly being gobbled up by Angmar, with the Elves only helping when it is destroyed, while Gondor spends centuries fighting the Easterlings, Haradrim, and itself, leaving it a shadow of its former self by the time Sauron rolls round again.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Robert Baratheon crushes the Targaryen dynasty during the rebellion and becomes king. However he is such an irresponsible ruler that his government is in massive debt and only a few steps away from civil war.
</li><li> Daenerys conquers the cities of Slaver's Bay and ends slavery there. Within a few months there are uprisings against her rule and the former slavers are working to regain control. Violence gets so bad that some people are asking to be made slaves again so they can at least be safe.
</li><li> House Lannister as a whole falls into this by the end of Season 4. They've won the War of the Five Kings and now rule Westeros, but the kingdom is a mess, and they are millions in debt to the Iron Bank of Braavos, casting serious doubt on their reputation for repayment and have to rely heavily on the Tyrells. The king whose rule they fought to cement has been assassinated and the next king is just an untrained boy. The Riverlands are in ruins and the North is <em>not</em> pacified. Stannis is back in the fight thanks to a loan from the Iron Bank — another result of the Lannisters' mounting debts. Other forces are working to undermine the Lannisters; Littlefinger controls the Vale, the Reach is maneuvering to control the new king, and the Martells hate the Lannisters more than ever after the demise of Oberyn. Rather than deal with these problems, they spend most of the post-war period fighting among themselves. Their armies are decimated from all the fighting and the gold mines have run dry for <em>years</em>. When the dust settles, their very capable patriarch is killed by Tyrion, who flees to Essos, and the realm is now in the hands of the very unpopular Cersei, who is prone to infighting with Jaime.
</li><li> In the Season 6 finale, Cersei has managed to eliminate all threats to her rule in King's Landing, and the suicide of her son means she now sits on the throne. However, her actions have alienated pretty much every ally the throne might have had. The Reach has sided with Dorne and Daenarys Targaryen in retribution for the deaths of most of their family line. House Bolton has been extinguished by the joint forces of surviving loyal Northern houses under Jon Snow and the Knights of the Vale, so the North is in rebellion once more. Walder Frey and his male descendants have been assassinated by Arya Stark, freeing the Riverlands from the Freys' control. Finally, the last Targaryen is coming to Westeros to reclaim her right for the Iron Throne. Cersei will be hard-pressed to retain her power in such a climate. However, as of the Season 7 finale, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cersei was able to retain her position, even after her forces were crushed by Daenerys Targaryen, thanks to the bigger White Walker threat coming from the North forcing everyone to make a truce and fight together against it.

With Daenerys' credibility in shambles, she's quickly assassinated by her own fiancee before she can begin a genocidal conquest. Weeks later, Daenerys' leaderless army and the utterly defeated survivors of King's Landing simply elect a new king. They vote in <em>Bran</em>, who they believe will make the perfect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">Puppet King</a>, only for Bran to use his sociopathic omniscience to turn the crumbling empire of the Seven Kingdoms into the foundations of the future Federation of Westeros with no one the wiser. The winners utterly lose because they could no longer see that they already won and kept killing their rewards, while the losers utterly win by being tricked into doing the one thing they opposed with all their might - republically electing a benevolent tyrant with supernatural foresight and centuries of wisdom, over their 'rightful', politically-inexperienced, and utterly naive king.</span>

However, with the wars won they quickly realized that they were over their heads when it came to actually governing a new nation in a world without electricity. Monroe became more tyrannical and brutal in his rule and a disenchanted Miles decided to just walk away from the whole enterprise since he would have been just as bad a ruler as Monroe. By the time the series has started the Monroe Republic is a technologically backwards place that is on the verge of being attacked and defeated by its more advanced and better ruled neighbors.

Together, they were able to recapture the Imperial City and repulse the Dominion from Cyrodiil.

Instead, he decided to sue for peace, and the best he could manage was the White-Gold Concordat, an uneasy cease-fire treaty with terms heavily favorable to the Dominion (in fact, it was noticed that the treaty was in effect not that different from the Aldmeri Dominion ultimatum which had started the war in the first place). Included was the ceding of large tracts of the Hammerfell province to the Dominion, the official dissolution of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientOrderOfProtectors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientOrderOfProtectors">Blades</a>, a ban on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">Talos</a> worship, and the right for the Thalmor to enforce these terms even within the boundaries of the Empire itself. Feeling betrayed by the Empire, Hammerfell immediately seceded and waged their own war to push the Dominion out of Hammerfell (in which they actually succeeded single-handedly, raising even more questions and doubt about whether Emperor's decision to sue for peace was sound to begin with). Also feeling betrayed were the Nords, to whom Talos was their most popular deity.

<ul><li> Many historians speculate that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> would have fallen victim to this trope if he ever stopped his eternal campaigning and actually tried to <em>govern</em> the lands he conquered. The fact that his empire fell apart almost immediately after his death seems to support this speculation. Although some historians have leveled the failure of Alexander's empire on the inadequate charisma and leadership of his subordinates, only Alexander's cult of personality could keep his empire together. Even if he managed to govern well for the remainder of his life, it would all be for naught if he could not transfer his authority to a successor. Since Alexander the Great died at 32, way before his time, there is no way of knowing if Alexander himself could have prevented the fall of his empire.
</li><li> In 535 CE, Byzantine Emperor Justinian I sought to retake Italy from the Ostrogoths, triggering a 20-year long war that actually did more harm than good to the former Western Empire (who did enjoy some stability with Ostrogothic King Theodoric). The Byzantines won in end, but the war left their empire broke, left Italy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb">utterly ravaged and depopulated</a>, and also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">The Plague</a> made things even worse. The Byzantines found out Italy costed too much to keep, and when the Lombards marched into Italy to conquer it ten years after the war was won, they barely met resistance.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">Wars of the Roses</a> kept restarting all the time because no one faction was able to build a lasting peace.
<ul><li> By 1461, the Lancastrians were a spent force. Their king was captured, their queen was in hiding, and their generals were dead or captured. London was firmly in Yorkist hands and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfPlantagenet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfPlantagenet">Edward of York</a> had been crowned Edward IV. Unfortunately for him, he inherited a country run by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">Dysfunction Junction</a> of noblemen who represented the worst of feudalism. His main benefactor, the Earl of Warwick, was alienated by the King's refusal to marry one of his daughters, rather than the Lancastrian widow who became his queen, and raised a rebellion with the help of his transparently treacherous younger brother George, which briefly put Henry VI back on the throne. Edward got the throne back, in battle, but he could never quite achieve enough political control to ensure a smooth succession.
</li><li> The principal reason was the constant redistribution of land between various lords, barons and magnates after the defeat of their faction in one rebellion or another. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII">Richard III</a> on his accession had hoped to avoid this but even he had to transfer Northern magnates in Southern lands after ousting the Woodville faction. The end result ironically was that the constant land exchanges over time made the Royal Crown the biggest landowner (since they claimed land for which no dispute could be resolved and with the constant deaths and in-fighting this was easy enough). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor">Henry Tudor</a>, reclaimed the throne and established the House of Tudor and he put a stop to all the land-exchanges and used his old base to build a solid centralized monarchy.
</li></ul></li><li> The peace treaty ending the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishSovietWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishSovietWar">Polish-Soviet War</a>. The Polish government was dominated by the Nationalists, who wanted only as much territory as it could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillBeAssimilated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillBeAssimilated">assimilated</a> into Poland, as opposed to commander-in-chief Piłsudski, who wanted as much ground as he could to make it allied buffer states. So, the Poles took less than the Reds were willing to offer.
<ul><li> The main problem was that both Germany and the Soviet Union felt that Poland had taken too much and wanted "their" territories back, so there was a strong possibility of another Russo-Polish war in any case, no matter how many territorial gains the Poles were able to enforce with French support.
</li></ul></li><li> Post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2">WW2</a> Britain lost its Empire and was forced to surrender its status as a world power to America. The economic problems caused by the War are more in the realm of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>, though.
<ul><li> For the Western Allies as a whole, there was some bitterness over the European situation after the war. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> was obviously on-coming, and absolutely nothing could be done to prevent Stalin from assembling the Eastern Bloc given the world has just exhausted itself defeating the Axis.
</li><li> In the case of Germany and Japan, who lost WWII utterly and completely but became stable, functional democracies with incredibly powerful economies, you could argue that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Lost the War, Won the Peace</a>. German and Japanese leaders were flabbergasted when the Americans offered to open up their massive domestic market and to keep the sea-lanes safe for world trade effectively for free, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot">which nullified the entire reason they started the war to begin with</a> (to establish their own autarky in Europe and Asia). Some of their former opponents thought that the opposite, i.e. this trope played straight, applied to themselves.
</li><li> The USSR won the war - and certainly gained influence and superpower status - but lost the peace in the long run. The country had suffered such horrendous losses economically, materially and in manpower that it took her decades to recover, and that's not even getting into the burden of reconstruction in various Warsaw Pact countries (and then supplying them with subsidized energy to keep them on the USSR's side). The start of the nuclear arms race also made them invest into military expenditure, which despite being cut back by Khruschev in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, eventually ballooned out of control under Brezhnev and his successors, becoming one of the factors behind the eventual downfall and dissolution of the USSR.
</li></ul></li><li> The Suez Crisis was a military victory but political failure for the non-Egyptian parties. When Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, the Britain and France sought to retake the canal by having Israel capture it and then the two European nations intervene under the guise of peacekeeping. While the British, French and Israeli military forces soundly defeated Egyptian military forces, they lost the political goodwill from the international community. US President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> angrily condemned the invasion as he feared it would drag NATO into a costly war, and USSR Premier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikitaKhrushchev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikitaKhrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> threatened to deploy nukes in the Middle East in retaliation. The only outcome of crisis was that British and French foreign influence weakened while Nasser became a hero amongst third world nations.
</li><li> The Persian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GulfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GulfWar">Gulf War</a> was pretty much this. It did nothing meaningful and only worsened the already growing anti-American sentiment of the Middle East, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>. On a smaller scale, America went into an economic recession in the aftermath of the war, causing approval ratings for President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">George H. W. Bush</a> to plummet, leading him in turn to lose his re-election bid in 1992 to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>.
<ul><li> That said, the outcome of the Gulf War could've been worse. During the war, some politicians wanted to go further by invading Iraq and disposing Saddam Hussein. President George H. W. Bush rejected this option, arguing that it would would result in political instability and create a power vacuum for terrorists. In hindsight given the War on Terror, an invasion of Iraq during the Gulf War would've resulted in a bigger military win but a worse political defeat.
</li></ul></li><li> This is a popular stereotype how Bulgaria's wars end.
<ul><li> The rule of Simeon the Great of the First Bulgarian empire (the one who actually made it into an empire) is hailed in historiography as Bulgaria's golden age. Simeon waged many wars of expansion and beat enemies such as Croatia and the Byzantine Empire into submission, turning Bulgaria into the sole major power in the region. This, however, only lasted until his death. Between a populace exhausted by wars, huge expenditures on culture and prestige, a greedy clergy causing heresy and dissent among the peasants, vengeful neighbors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordesFromTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordesFromTheEast">Hordes from the East</a> taking lands too far away to guard, his son Peter I, even if he had 40 years of nominal peace (absence of open war but not rebellions and incursions), ushered in the empire's downfall.
</li><li> From modern history: the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 (when Russia assembled a vast alliance of Balkan states to fight against Turkish control of the Balkans and independence for Bulgaria and managed to do the nearly unthinkable by pushing into the very suburbs of Constantinople... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">right before the Congress of Berlin forced the allies to yield most of their gains back to Turkey</a>) and the First Balkan war, in which Bulgaria shouldered some of the heaviest burdens, but its allies got most of the territory, causing them to fall out over the spoils. Then things went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a>.
</li><li> Between the two wars, Bulgarians staged the bloodless reunion of the country with its southern half, which had been left as an autonomous region within the Ottoman empire. This went without the approval of the Great Powers and Russia prompted Serbia to attack Bulgaria as punishment. Bulgaria won the war but lost Russia's geopolitical support, which resulted in three of its surrounding countries (Greece, Serbia and Romania) forming a long-term alliance against it with Russian blessing.
</li><li> The other half of the stereotype, of course, is the inversion. Bulgaria was the only Axis power to come out with territorial gains<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1eyng');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1eyng" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1eyng');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">regaining land previously annexed in a surprise invasion</span> from the Second World War, regaining the ethnically Bulgarian Quadrilater/South Dobruja<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2e6rf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2e6rf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2e6rf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was ceded peacefully while both countries were Axis members, then the change was approved after they both had switched sides to USSR</span> and winning the peace despite losing the war. Bulgaria still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakeningTheSleepingGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakeningTheSleepingGiant">declared token war on the US and UK</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeYourArmPunchingOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeYourArmPunchingOutCthulhu">got bombed for it</a>, and also got invaded by the USSR and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayOfTheJackboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayOfTheJackboot">underwent a coup assisted by the Soviet army</a>, turning into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand">dictatorship</a>. It also didn't keep Macedonia, which was why it joined the Nazis in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> This was the common opinion of the Congress of Vienna, which ended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a> and established a new status quo for Europe. Justified or not, virtually every party felt betrayed by some portion of the outcome. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3oru0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3oru0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3oru0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Russia's ambitions for a united Poland and dual monarchy were quashed, as were Prussian goals to absorb all of Saxony. The Bourbon French and Hapsburg Austria were annoyed that Murat was to be tolerated in "their" Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (until his sudden betrayal in the Hundred Days gave them an excuse to depose and shoot him anyway). Denmark's loss of Norway to Sweden was confirmed to compensate the Swedes for their own loss of Finland to Russia. Austria ceded the Austrian Netherlands to the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was content with that until they eventually rebelled to form Belgium. France was on the verge of coming out ahead in spite of losing the war after Talleyrand successfully divided the Allies against each other and set himself up as a kingmaker player between the two alliances, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a> — Napoleon's Hundred Days — overturned Talleyrand's designs and cost France all their gains from 1790-1792, 700 million francs in indemnities, although to the dismay of German nationalists it was allowed to keep Alsace and Lorraine. German patriots also were disappointed that Germany became nothing more than a fairly loose confederation of 38 mostly small states. The only major powers to come out in front across the board was Britain, who still had to admit defeat in convincing the other powers to accept anything stronger than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StronglyWordedLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StronglyWordedLetter">Strongly Worded Letter</a>-style condemnation of the slave trade; the new Kingdoms of Bavaria and Wurtemburg, who had their borders confirmed; and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, which regained their old borders with the addition of the Republic of Genoa, but still had to tolerate Hapsburg statelets throughout Italy in addition to Austrian Lombardy and Venetia.</span> On the other hand, the system established in Vienna proved able to preserve peace in Europe for a long time, at least until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RevolutionsOf1848" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RevolutionsOf1848">Revolutions of 1848</a>. In particular it is notable that the Vienna system managed to avoid a major European war over the revolutions of 1830 and 1831 and after the Oriental Crisis of 1840, when the government of France was itching to compensate for its loss of face in Egypt by starting a war to "regain the natural frontier" on the Rhine.
<ul><li> Before 1814, Revolutionary and Napoleonic France proved itself incapable of concluding a lasting peace, which led Prince Metternich to tell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> during his negotiations in Dresden in the Summer of 1813 that all his peace treaties had just been armistices.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> is a complicated matter to be certain. While it should be noted that the American Military won the majority (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.g2mil.com/lost_vietnam.htm">though not all<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) of individual <em>battles</em> they were involved in, they never achieved a decisive victory. The Americans underestimated how durable the spirit of their Vietnamese enemy was: they wanted to win far more than the Americans wanted them to lose, meaning that a prolonged war and large casualties were not enough to stop them. The Americans eventually headed back home, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">the cost of victory being too high</a> and substantial political pressure building against the war. However, even with the opposing force out of their hair, governing the new Communist Vietnam was not easy for the victors. There were rebels to quell, and even a war or two with its neighbors to the West before things became truly stable. After all that fighting with the Americans peace did not come easy for the Vietnamese.
<ul><li> Americans themselves were left pretty bad off. The war brought distrust of the government, a generation of young men dead, wounded, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">mentally scared for life</a>. Even their main objective, stopping the spread of communism south, was only delayed for a few years and eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">the theory</a> behind that intervention was discredited when Communist Vietnam's invasion of Communist Cambodia uncovered and ended the Khmer Rouge's genocide. At the same time, Vietnam successfully fought off Cambodia's main backer, Communist China (allied with America and Cambodia at one point) in a bloody border war.
</li></ul></li><li> The jury is still out on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>, but the outlook isn't rosy. The primary goal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> has thus far been achieved: the security of the United States, though at the cost of dancing distressingly close to the limits of constitutionality (whether the line was actually crossed is a matter of interpretation; what is undisputed is that it has been extremely unpleasant for all involved), and the thousands of lives lost and tens of thousands wounded, plus billions and billions of dollars. And with Iraq's and Afghanistan's democratic governments in ever-more-dire straits, it seems disappointingly likely that the secondary goal to create stable democracies in the Middle East will fail.
<ul><li> In general, there is often a feeling that the military "successes" of the US have only placed it in a worse position, as military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan has merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">created a new generation of terrorists</a> that loathe the US because they killed innocent people and families that had no part in Al-Qaeda. Not to mention, the fear of terrorism that gripped the country following 9/11 has lead to an increasingly pervasive surveillance state; and given the militarization of US police departments (as illustrated <a class="urllink" href="https://dekerivers.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/152393_600.jpg?w=600&amp;h=404">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), some would say they're on their way to a police state.
</li></ul></li><li> This seems to be the case for a lot of modern day coups and revolutions. Hoping (perhaps) to use other successful revolutions, the two major ones that stand out are the American and French as a source of inspiration, many of these countries fall into relative disarray shortly afterwards. But perhaps a cause why many of these revolutions fail is because they weren't led by people who actually know how to run a country (or any large body of people). As one historian put it "They win, have a big party, wake up with a hangover, and ask 'Now what?'" The Libyan civil war may be given a an example. Although the anti-Gaddafi forces had won, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> was dead, the country is left in disarray with the new government now trying to restore proper order while fighting rival militias.
<ul><li> Philippines' peaceful EDSA Revolution did overthrow then President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FerdinandMarcos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FerdinandMarcos">Ferdinand Marcos</a> for abusing his power during the Martial Law era. But as two decades past, the country is still suffering from corruption and decadency which doesn't help that Marcos' wife and children are elected in several government positions with the son running and <em>nearly winning</em> for vice-presidency for the 2016 elections. Several political analysts <a class="urllink" href="http://opinion.inquirer.net/93539/the-millennials">noted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that incompetence and the lack of political will in the previous administrations resulted the current state of the country and people who were born after EDSA became cynical and disillusioned on the price which the revolution left for them.
</li></ul></li><li> The Paris Peace Conference that ended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> is commonly regarded as this, though <em>why</em> it was lost and <em>who</em> is to blame is a subject of debate.
<ul><li> In the end what the Allies produced was, to paraphrase the words of Ferdinand Foch, "Not a peace treaty, but an armistice for 20 years." When it was all said and done, everyone on both sides had reasons to be resentful of the treaty, either because they were ignored entirely (Russia, China), they gained something from it but not all they wanted (Italy, Japan, France) or they believed they lost everything (Germany, Austria, Hungary, Turkey), and thus, instead of making peace, it only really sowed the seeds for more conflict. Not to mention that the various governments reasons for going to war, stiffling internal dissent, cracked with the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a>, greater demand for democracy at home and in the colonies.
</li><li> Italy's case is particularly notable, because the lack of some gains (namely Istria, Dalmatia and some of Germany's African colonies) was caused by both the incompetence of the Italian delegation *and* Woodrow Wilson's stubborn refusal to award them the former two regions. The diplomats walked out in protest when the American president tried to stop the acquisition these Austro-Hungarian territories and did not rejoin until he had failed, by which point the German colonies had already been assigned. That (along with the appalling economic situation) nearly caused a three-way civil war between the Italian government, war veterans on the anarchist side and war veterans on the far right side (with at least one incident where far right activists and Royal troops nearly fired on each other), and paved the way for the rise of Fascism.
</li><li> The underlying problem here was often that many of the victors immediately got into conflicts over territories and spheres of influence with each other, e. g. Italy and Yugoslavia, Poland and Czechoslovakia, France and Britain (over parts of the former Ottoman Empire and also over the policy towards the new Turkish state). Another problem was that the League of Nations and the European system of defense treaties was irreparably weakened by President Wilson losing his domestic support, which led to the United States refusing to ratify the peace treaties or to join the League.
</li><li> The case of Germany was long argued by John M. Keynes who felt the treaty was overly punitive to Germany and unfairly targeted their economy and held them guilty for the war. This argument was rebutted by Etienne Mantoux, a liberal French economist who died in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>. Mantoux pointed out that the reason the peace the failed was because other governments were <em>too lenient</em> on Germany which had an economy that could have easily paid the reparations to no point. Mantoux also noted that Keynes' beliefs of the war hurting Germany's resources and economy is not borne out by statiscal examinations of their output in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties">The Roaring '20s</a>. Furthermore, as later German historians such as Hans Mommsen have admitted, the Treaty of Versailles became a rallying cry among Nazis and other nationalists, and internalized by leftists and liberals, because it never categorically and fully extracted responsibility for the war from Germany. Other historians have pointed out that from a strategic point of view the treaty actually made Germany a lot <em>stronger</em> than before the war. While its army was almost entirely disbanded and they lost some territory, they kept pretty much all of their industrially viable territories and population so they could easily rebuild it. Their entire eastern frontier was also no longer covered by two huge empires that could keep it in check and replaced by several smaller, weaker states with their own internal and external feuds.
</li></ul></li><li> The 18th century wars would end up exhausting the European powers and bringing an end to their colonial ambitions in North America.
<ul><li> The British victory would in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar">Seven Years' War</a>. Although the British successfully forced the French to succeed the Great Lakes and northern territories, it also became saddled with debt that lead to the British government imposing taxes on its subjects. Some of these colonists in America would then revolt to protest the taxation, leading to another war for Britain to fight.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> would become this for the French. During the American Revolutionary War, France decided to back the colonists in seceding from the British as revenge for their humiliating defeat in the Seven Years War. However, while the American revolution succeeded, France was left in crippling debt that lead to the country undergoing its own revolution a few years later.

The actual invasion and defeat of the Ottoman forces was relatively easy, given the difference in firepower between the Italian invaders and the Ottoman Army, supported by the local tribes. Then corruption and incompetence among the bureaucracy prevented the defeat of a revolt in southern Fezzan when it was still small, the attempt at defeating it in open field ended in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">defeat</a> due a combination of incompetence on the part of the Royal Army's upper echelons (who failed to provide the Italian or colonial Eritrean troops needed to do the job) and arrogance of the field commander (who could have still won the day or limit the damage had he not brought too many supplies with him) - therefore, by the time Italy entered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> the Italians had been forced to the coast. They eventually managed to "pacify" the colony, but only in the early '30s and after a long, bloody and expensive war of reconquest.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> only looks like a victory for the North if you end it when Lee surrendered to Grant at the Appomattox Court House. However, the actual war was followed by the twelve-year-long Reconstruction Era, which despite being won by the North was eventually reversed by the South via Jim Crow.
<ul><li> For those twelve years, the South was more-or-less under martial law with Northern troops forcing the Southern states to observe reforms being made by the federal government, such as black men being granted the right to vote. There was massive resistance from the South, including the emergence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. The Klan and associated goon squads in effect to harass and disenfranchise black voters were shut down after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> sent reinforcements. However, the North and the Union lost interest in Reconstruction by the end of Grant's tenure, with fence-sitters and other liberals no longer feeling content to stand up for African-American suffrage.
</li><li> At the end of the day, the South got pretty much everything it wanted, with slavery traded for segregation and black suffrage taken away through a set of sneaky laws known as Black Codes, or Jim Crow laws. These included but were not limited to poll taxes, literacy tests, and having to guess how many items were in a full jar — but you were exempt from these tests if your grandfather had been eligible to vote, which mean all white males were in and black males were out. This situation lasted for almost one hundred years, until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">Civil Rights Movement</a> picked up in the 1950s. Slavery was replaced with "prison labor," with all kinds of new laws targeted at blacks (requirements for jobs they didn't have, to be literate even though just a few years before they would face all kinds of punishments if they tried, or just flat out pay off debts that didn't exist). The white judges and all white juries would convict any black man that came into the court. The worst part about this was, slaves were an investment, prisoners are expendable.
</li><li> Neither was it a true victory for Southern Whites. Some members of the planter elite who formed the aristocracy were dispossessed of their lands, and since the US government abolished slavery without compensation (the Confederates who fired on Fort Sumter spat on Lincoln's mercy when he offered this, which put this forever off the table), they were never quite able to properly replace their losses and industrialize. The sheer scale of destruction and the economic tumult basically destroyed the independent yeoman class, which was seen for a hundred years prior as a bastion of American Republicanism, as previously self-sufficient farmers were forced into a sharecropper system that essentially amounted to economic serfdom. If anything the Scorched Earth policies of Sherman may be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a>, with the economic damage being so horrific that only in the closing years of the 20th century would citizens of modern Southern states achieve economic parity with their pre-Civil War ancestors.
</li><li> The post-1877 compromises between the Federal governmnent and the South <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">actually paid off in the long run</a>. What it needed for the USA to raise themselves to superpower status was <em>naval power</em> - the only form of power which decided between nations at the height of the Victorian Age.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.historynet.com/sparta-the-fall-of-the-empire.htm">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> article goes into extensive detail about how this happened to ancient Sparta; while their rigid social castes and harsh internal pressures produced the peerless military elite of their era, it also meant that they were utterly unable to adapt and maintain a stable empire — after their overwhelming victory over Athens in 404 BC, they wasted their strength on internal political struggles, offended literally everyone in the region with their arrogance, and ultimately set themselves up for total defeat from which they never recovered mere decades later.
<ul><li> It is also worth noting that Sparta's inward-looking culture caused it to miss several opportunities that rivals seized. Sparta's hyper-religious and xenophobic attitudes worked great for maintaining their social order and scaring off potential invaders, but more than once neighboring states went to Sparta for help, only to get a lame excuse about needing to stay home for a religious festival, or else just being ignored. Athens, on the other hand, had a somewhat flexible social order and was filled with ambitious politicians who jumped at a chance to look like a hero. This contrast was later taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with Rome. The same lack of flexibility ultimately undermined even their military power; the rest of the Greek cities slowly developed more advanced phalanx tactics to the point that Spartan techniques were outdated and overshadowed, and they had no chance at all against Roman legions. After the Roman conquest their culture was continued... as a quaint tourist attraction.
