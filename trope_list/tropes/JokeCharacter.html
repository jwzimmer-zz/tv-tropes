<ul><li> One of the unlockable characters is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wonder-Future, Wonder-Red from the past</span>. His special weapon is a Unite Hand that is already on fire and shoots <em>two</em> fireballs... but it's always in the smallest size.

</li><li> Wonder-Director, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an Author Avatar of the game's director Hideki Kamiya</span>. He dies in one hit when being played as, is the only character in the game with a slower running speed than anyone else, has a fairly weak Unite Morph, and even sounds bored to match the sillyness.

<ul><li> The Can parts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CustomRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CustomRobo">Custom Robo</a></em> for the Gamecube are basically less powerful versions of the parts you start the game with. The Can Legs decrease all capabilities, while the Can body is ridiculously weak and easy to knock down.
<ul><li> The DS version has the Chick Robo. It's a baby bird with horrible stats, and all of its guns shoot chickens.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerd">nerd</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a>: The Third Encounter</em> has absolutely pathetic Strength and Missile stats, and only a lower-end-of-decent Speed stat.

In combat, he's just as effective as Bayonetta and has the same powers and weapons. The problem is there is no such thing as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> with him.

Which means he can be instantly killed even by a single <em>Decoration</em> (the weakest among the weakest enemies)! Needless to say, beating the game above Easy Mode with him by using no items <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">officially makes you a badass</a>.
</li><li> Most of <em>Gourmet Sentai Bara Yarou</em>'s secret characters are worthless.

Appliance's one attack isn't even any good.
</li><li> Swimmer can only move by hopping, making him very awkward to control.
</li><li> Piko Piko would've been one of the better secret characters if it weren't for her poor recovery rate. If she's knocked down, she's as good as dead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a>: Sanctuary Battle</em> has Unicorn Jabu, known for losing pretty much every battle he was in during the anime. In the game, while all the other characters have two or three Cosmo attacks, he has only one. It's pretty hard to aim, it's not very damaging and it's fairly useless during the actual stages, only being somewhat useful against bosses (and even then it's hard to connect it properly). He also has the worst stat growth in the game, gaining only 2 attack points per level up. That means that if the player doesn't feed him thousands upon thousands of Cosmo Points, even at Lv. 99 he'll have less than 300 Attack, less than a third of the cap and effectively being unable to damage any boss on any difficulty beyond Hard. And the kicker? He's a DLC character going for no less than $5.00 US.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> fangame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GriefSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GriefSyndrome">Grief Syndrome</a></em> has Homura, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">the worst stats in the game</a>, but some of the most useful abilities. However, as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>, it allows you to play as Homura <em>before</em> the beginning of the series. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Moemura</a>" keeps the awful stats, and replaces the machine guns, rocket launchers, and mortars with a Deagle, a shotgun, and a golf club, and her pipe bombs don't explode on contact like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass">Future Badass</a> Homura's do, leaving her attacks with a slight delay. You can imagine how well this works in combat. She's not completely useless, largely thanks to Time Stop, but she has a much harder time finishing the game than any other character.
<ul><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> player character, available if more people are playing together than there are magical girls still alive, is... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Kyuubey</a>! It literally has no attacks, and can be attacked by the other players.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> is full of cards that seem underpowered or even useless, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=88817">One With Nothing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?id=113512">Norin the Wary<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, that exist solely for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes">Player Archetypes</a> who like to try and make a workable deck out of such cards.
<ul><li> The prize for "Worst Card In The Game" unquestionably goes to <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/lg/en/129.html">Wood Elemental<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which requires you to sacrifice <em>untapped</em> forests to power up. Destroying lands sets you back hard. Destroying unused lands sets you back harder. Destroying unused lands to power a 4-mana cost creature (by only +1/+1, and it starts from 0/0) that can be killed by a 10-cent doom blade and has no other abilities is beyond idiotic. To make it even less useful, you can't even use this power-up ability after the card is in play; only while it's being summoned.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136151">Steamflogger Boss<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a card introduced in <em>Future Sight</em> that supported a mechanic that <em>didn't exist yet</em>, making it almost completely useless. It took over ten years for "assembling Contraptions" to be introduced in the joke set <em>Unstable</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In a similar vein, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> has an amazing number of cards that have no conceivable use, or that simply don't do their job well. Early sets were crammed with low-stat normal monsters that were irrelevant even at release, but even then, some went above and beyond. Witness Thousand-Eyes Idol, a monster with the lowest stats possible (0 attack and 0 defense) and no effect.
<ul><li> Shapesnatch due to his "horrible power". Ironically, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">among the best when it comes to low-stat normal monsters</a>, and certainly scores points for his <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shapesnatch">jaunty bow tie.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This is in contrast to his first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhTheDuelistsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhTheDuelistsOfTheRoses">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses</a></em>, where he was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Immortal.</a>
</li><li> A notable one is Fusionist, a Fusion monster (requiring three cards to get out) that actually has <em>less</em> power than one of its pieces (which was already pathetically low) and no effect. <em><strong>And it's a rare!</strong></em>
</li><li> It seems to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">tradition</a> for sets, starting with <em>Tactical Evolution</em>'s Broken Bamboo Sword (which is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem">Lethal Joke Item</a>) to have one card with a completely detrimental or useless effect. Fine forces you to discard two cards, An Unfortunate Report lets your opponent attack you twice, Cold Feet makes it impossible for you to play Spells or Traps... Some of them are even inverted versions of famously good cards, such as The Forceful Sentry (which lets you look into your opponent's hand and knock a card of theirs back to the deck) becoming The Humble Sentry (which makes you reveal your hand and send one of your cards back to the deck). While you <em>can</em> potentially use these cards in very specific combos, they're complete dead draws otherwise.
</li><li> Similarly, it's a tradition for releases of Normal Monsters connected to Joey to have their flavor text <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentAdaptation">translated into a terrible Brooklyn accent.</a> These cards weren't jokes when they were originally released, but the fact that many of them weren't exported for more than a decade left them well behind the curve of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a>. At this stage, it's not like anyone was gonna use <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Anthrosaurus">Anthrosaurus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Meotoko">Meotoko<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> anyway, so you might as well get a laugh.
</li><li> Larvae Moth seems to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>'s answer to Wood Elemental. It's a card with 500 ATK and 400 DEF (for comparison, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Kuriboh</a> has 300/200), and it requires <em>setup</em> - playing a Petit Moth, equipping it with Cocoon of Evolution, and protecting it for two of your turns, AKA four turns. This summoning requirement also means that Larvae Moth is an Effect Monster, so it doesn't get Normal Monster support (the sole redeeming factor for most Joke Character cards). It's also Larvae Moth's only effect. It's the only card where the wiki's "Tips" section actively suggests discarding it for a cost.
</li><li> Skull Servant was considered to be unplayable due to being a normal monster with only 300 ATK and 200 DEF. The fact that he was so weak has allowed an entire culture of decks to be devoted around him and was influential enough to stimulate Konami to create cards like King Of The Skull Servants to make Skull Servant more powerful. Nowadays, he's become something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Artist">Dark Artist<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — a monster with stats that were below-average in its time, and godawful at any time thereafter, and its only effect is that when it's attacked by a Light monster, it gets <em>even weaker.</em>
</li><li> A lot of very early effect monsters seemed to have had effects created by random number generators, and the king of them all is <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Yado_Karu">Yado Karu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Its effect is that when it's changed to Defense Position, it lets you return any number of cards in your hand to the bottom of your deck. Put simply, there are only two situations where this is beneficial — when your opponent is playing a Mill deck and you need to put some cards in your deck right now or you will lose, or when you accidentally drew into one of the small handful of cards that can only be used from the Deck (such as Assault Modes). In any other case, all this card does is take cards you have immediate access to and then put them out of your reach. Just activating the effect is fairly cumbersome and slow, it has bad stats, and on top of that, it's not even unique; there are plenty of cards that let you send your own cards back into the Deck (Plaguespreader Zombie, Pot of Generosity, Transmigration Prophecy, Assault Teleport, Magical Mallet) with much greater efficiency.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/True_Exodia">True Exodia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, like the rest of the Exodia-based monsters, offers an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a>. You must have it and the four Forbidden One limbs as the <em>only</em> monsters on the field to trigger this, and the card has no stats or upsides to offset this. For all that effort, True Exodia gives the victory to... <em>its controller's opponent.</em> It's clearly designed for laughs and trying to get a proper win with it (by switching its control) is more trouble than it's worth, though that hasn't stopped players from trying.
</li><li> Some characters from the anime can fill this role when they're opponents in videogames, particularly characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">who never dueled.</a> Tristan and Mokuba tend to favor the aforementioned extremely weak Normal Monsters or suicidally bad strategies, but Dorothy in <em>Tag Force</em> seems to be an ongoing experiment in making unplayable decks. One of her decks has nothing but Level 5 or higher Normal Monsters, making it impossible for her to play anything. Another is a sixty-card (and therefore hugely inconsistent) deck based on bringing out the weakest Fusion Monsters in the game. Yet another is a deck that's nothing but drawing cards, causing her to deck herself out, and a fourth is a deck of nothing but detrimental cards like <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Burning_Algae">Burning Algae<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Fine">Fine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Some of her decks are actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">illegal</a></em>, by virtue of not complying to the banlist, meaning Dorothy is such a bad Duelist that she <em>breaks the game</em> to be worse at it. The anime seems to confirm this, as her only onscreen duel was her Summoning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Marshmallon</a> in ATK and then ending her turn, promptly costing the game for her partner. In <em>Tag Force 3</em>, though, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> when she's partnered with you: her Deck is nothing but Tuners and Synchro-based support cards with a powerful assortment of Synchros, but since Synchros need a Tuner and a non-Tuner, she can't summon any of them... but since you're partnered with her, you can just provide the non-Tuners.
</li></ul></li><li> The Imakuni? cards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>. They have effects ranging from confusing your own Pokémon to forcing both players to sing as loud as they can. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer">No, really.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft">Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</a></em> tries to feature at least one hilariously awful card per set, usually invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> to the point of being useless. The Hearthstone wiki even has <a class="urllink" href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Worst_cards">a page dedicated to listing them<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Magma Rager. It's a 3 mana 5/1 with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser">Memetic Loser</a> status among the playerbase. Despite his impressive base attack, he simply dies. To everything. Your opponent can counter your entire turn three play with just a Hero Power and still have some leftover mana. The card is so bad, <a class="urllink" href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Rager">a whole group of cards<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> exist purely to make fun of it.
</li><li> Majordomo Executus is a 9 mana 9/7 that transforms your Hero into Ragnaros the Firelord on death. Ragnaros has a powerful Hero Power and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ragnaros</a>, but only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">8 health</a>! Most players will just kill Majordomo then one-shot Ragnaros before you have a chance to even use his power. Majordomo is the only card in the entire game who can instantly make you lose from any position in the game.
</li><li> Yogg-Saron was supposed to be another useless but cool card. That... didn't work out so well. See his entry on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_Boogeymonster">The Boogeymonster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is generally considered the worst card in Hearthstone. Even Majordomo can be given to your opponent or combined with cards that increase your hero's health, but Boogeymonster has no such use. He has bad stats (6/7 for 8 mana) and the sole effect of gaining +2/+2 after successfully attacking and killing an enemy minion. That means he needs to stay alive for multiple turns and keep killing enemy minions in order to become a big vanilla beatstick. For comparison, Gruul is a card that starts at a 7/7 for 8 and gains +1/+1 every turn passively. That means he's an 8/8 to your opponent and a 9/9 when it's your turn, ready to attack, and keeps growing. And even Gruul is considered bad.
</li><li> Mayor Noggenfogger is a 9 mana 5/4 that makes ALL targeted abilities random. That means any attack can be sent anywhere, as long as the target is legal (friendly minions can't hit each other, but most spells could go anywhere). His stats are terrible, his effect is symmetrical, and he isn't likely to save you. Hot damn if he isn't hilarious, though.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>:
<ul><li> The most famous Joke Character is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Dan Hibiki</a>. He was created as a joke about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK">SNK</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArtOfFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArtOfFighting">Art of Fighting</a></em> games, whose protagonists borrowed heavily from the <em>Street Fighter</em> games. Dan, in turn, can be summed up as Robert Garcia's head on Ryo Sakazaki's body (albeit with a pink gi instead of an orange one) and his attacks are almost completely ineffective (much like when a player tries to use special moves in <em>AOF</em> with a depleted Spirit Gauge). This status would largely persist until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapcomSequelStagnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapcomSequelStagnation">its updates</a>, in which Dan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">becomes a freaking beast</a>.
<ul><li> SNK later would make fun of him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">and themselves</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcomSVCChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcomSVCChaos">SVC Chaos</a></em>, namely by making Dan parody even more of Ryo's moves and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of nearly everyone—including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Dan himself</a></em>—mistaking him for Robert, along with ascending him to the mid-boss range.
</li><li> Even Demitri of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darkstalkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darkstalkers">Darkstalkers</a></em> hates Dan and wouldn't even take a sip of blood from him. "Only the beautiful and strong can serve me. You fail﻿ on both counts!"
</li><li> The Chairperson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools">Rival Schools</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorrespondenceCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorrespondenceCourse">apparently took weekend classes in Dan's martial art</a>, Saikyo. And it shows. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Unless she's your assistant instead of your main fighter, that is.</a>
</li><li> Dan Hibiki also has the most useless drop pattern of the entire <em>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo</em> cast: His pattern is all red. Bear in mind that clearing a gem also clears all adjacent gems of the same color, and all gems of the same color adjacent to those, and so on... Basically, the instant Dan's counter gems hit zero, a single red crash gem can completely counter every attack Dan has sent since the last such counterattack. However, he does have the special attribute of sending 150% as many counter gems. Used well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">you can bring a quick end to your opponent</a>; used poorly, and you set yourself up for massive damage.
</li><li> This also carries over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperGemFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperGemFighter">Super Gem Fighter</a></em>. Dan can only make red gems pop out of his opponent when he connects, meaning the only thing he's capable of maxing out on its own is the Gadoken. If you want to power up the Koryuken or the Dankukyaku, you have to either hit the treasure chest that appears at the start of a match or use the gems the <em>opponent is hitting out of you</em>.
</li><li> Dan makes an appearance as a Spirit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>, and the joke continues; he's got the worst power out of any Primary Spirit, to the point that not even equipping good Support Spirits can balance him out with the next-worst Spirits, and you start the fight with 30% damage and no trade-off benefit.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a></em> series gives us Sean, Ken's student, who has the unique distinction of starting off as one of the most powerful characters, but as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapcomSequelStagnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapcomSequelStagnation">Capcom Sequel Stagnation</a> takes effect, he's downgraded over time into becoming a joke character. Sean has trouble beating regular people, let alone trained fighters. His ending in <em>3rd Strike</em> has him lose to a random fighter in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> in the qualifying rounds. Ironically, as a few of his quotes indicate, he hates Dan with a passion and strives never to be like him.
</li></ul></li><li> Meat from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> is a hidden character that was like this. It initially served as a skin, created by art director Tony Goskie, for each fighter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat4">Mortal Kombat 4</a></em>. The name "Meat" was simply a designation given to the model so it could be used in the game. It was later decided to make him a playable character as part of a hidden Easter egg, albeit one with an almost nonexistent backstory (pretty much nothing other than being a one of Shao Khan's failed experiments). For a long time, whether he was a real character at all was debated among fans, and it came as a <em>big</em> surprise then he was actually included later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatArmageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatArmageddon">Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</a></em> (with somewhat more of a story, but still not much of one).
</li></ul><ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomClashOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomClashOfSuperHeroes">Marvel vs. Capcom</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2">its sequel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Roll</a> is the Joke Character. Based on a character who's normally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDamsel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDamsel">Distressed Damsel</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralFemale">Neutral Female</a> at most, Roll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone">basically plays like Mega Man</a> (who's already nothing special) but worse in just about every single way. Pitiful damage, low health, laggy attacks... her only advantage is being fairly small, which can help her avoid attacks (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">against certain bosses</a>). Most tier listings give her a special ranking, with "Roll Tier" being a common term in the fighting game community for extremely bad characters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Hercule/Mister Satan</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai"> Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</a></em> series. In the first installment, his attacks and special attacks can do reasonable damage to any other character, pinning him in the same tier as other decent fighters and even receiving a bonus story featuring him fighting his way through the Cell Games. In the third installment, he's the only character in the game whose base ki only goes up to two bars instead of three or more, he can't shoot ki blasts, and often his special attacks are actually things like him tripping and accidentally headbutting the opponent. Furthermore, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokaiTenkaichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokaiTenkaichi">Tenkaichi/Sparking</a></em> series, the damage dealt by his melee attacks is <em>far</em> lower than any other character, he hurls short-ranged rocks and grenades instead of Ki blasts, and his Ultimate Attack will either cause a somewhat reasonable amount of damage (around a regular character's "Blast 2" damage, which is still pretty bad for a UB), or do <em>1 point of damage</em>! In <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em>, characters don't even flinch from his melee attacks, making them incredibly hard to pull off, and making it nearly impossible for him to take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">Oozaru</a> who are immune to all of his special moves. Equipping an item that makes the enemies flinch when hit will pass him into a "usable" category, making him at least a good option to fill a slot in a Dragon Points Battle, since he only uses one point.
<ul><li> Mr. Satan is also notable for this in <em>The Legacy of Goku II</em>. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath">Goku dies in the Cell Games</a>, he becomes a playable character. If you get him up to level 50, you can view <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">an alternate ending</a> where instead of watching everyone summon the Dragon and stuff, Mr. Satan appears on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkShow">Talk Show</a> talking about how awesome he is.
</li><li> Skinny Tiencha in <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2</em>. Even the most basic attacks consume massive energy, and he is unable to perform Tiencha's special moves (he coughs if you even try).
</li><li> The <em>Tenkaichi</em> games have a lot of these, since their gimmick is having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>. Just about everyone from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> is a lot weaker than the <em>Z</em> characters - their attacks don't hit very hard, a lot of them can't fly at all, and they lack the general raw power, speed, and durability of their counterparts (with a few, like King Piccolo, Arale, and Nam, being passable, and a few others, like Spike and Yajirobe, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Characters</a>). There's also a number of characters designed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, including Frieza Soldiers, Saibamen, and Cell Juniors, which are appropriately unimpressive, with generic moves and poor damage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse">Xenoverse</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse2">Xenoverse 2</a></em> also have the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> playable, and on top of having low stats and access to only the least effective Ultimate Attack in the game, all damage they take is tripled.
</li></ul></li><li> Hyena in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a> Maximum Impact 2</em> moves erratically and has several... odd attacks. Most notably, his super move "The Century's Most Fearsome Acting!" has him walk at the opponent, fake being KO'd if hit... and then spring back up with a powerful kick. But if they throw him, which is quite likely given his pace, he really <em>gets</em> KO'd...

</li><li> Pichu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></em> is a weakened, baby version of Pikachu. It damages itself when it uses electrical attacks, it's lighter and easier to knock off, has drastically inferior range, and often has to use its head in the place of Pikachu's longer, more powerful tail. There are some advantages, such as it being a little faster, having higher knockback, and possessing a tiny hit-box, but most would agree that that doesn't make up for all of the disadvantages. In fact, Pichu's own trophies blatantly admit that it's worthless, going so far as to describe it as the weakest character in the game, and that it's better suited as a handicap for experienced players fighting newer, unskilled players. People were legitimately vexed when it turned out that Pichu was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros.

</li><li> Fan game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosCrusade">Super Smash Bros. Crusade</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioIsMissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioIsMissing">Weegee</a>. His sole reason for being in the game is due to a gag during development. His entire moveset is one big memefest. The dev team claims that they were intending to remove Weegee from the roster, but he stuck, making him the only exception (besides Goku) to the "characters featured on Nintendo consoles only" rule when deciding the character roster.
</li><li> Kon and Bonnie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a>: Blade of Fate</em> both qualify. Kon has one special move and takes more damage than any other character in the game, and Bonnie has <em>no</em> normal attacks. One is a stuffed animal and the other is a giant boar.
<ul><li> Another in Hanataro in <em>Bleach: Shattered Blade</em> for the Wii. Hitting an opponent with your sword actually heals them, leaving him dependent on headbutts and a trip/roll attack for damage.
</li><li> Amusingly, <em>Bleach: Dark Souls</em> sharpens Kon and Bonnie's claws slightly. Kon gains three more special moves and has actual <em>supers</em> now, while Bonnie retains her original movelist but gains basic attacks. Hanataro joins the cast, but he only has one move that uses his sword. The real joke character is Yuichi, the little boy Chad protects early on - he has zero range, dies in five hits, and his moves are him panicking.
<ul><li> <em>Dark Souls</em> also has one of the highest joke character counts of any game, with 8-13 characters of the 44 member cast qualifying. This is due to every generic mook from the story mode being playable, from generic Shinigami to nurses to the familiars a near-joke character summons.

With their chibi designs, ludicrous attacks, and rather bizarre origins, you're clearly not supposed to take them seriously. The main Neko-Arc is definitely the most conventional one, with her nonexistent range, low durability, and one of her main attacks being focused on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">flipping the controls</a> of <em>both</em> players—the Crescent version can be something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> if she can get a hit in and start a combo, but otherwise, she's pretty useless.

His attacks are so slow that they can be dodged easily even on higher difficulties, he can't run (only stomp around like a Sumo wrestler), his Ninja Dash is the slowest in the game, and his attacks, while they hurt when they land can be broken easily. This was completely changed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NarutoShippudenUltimateNinjaStorm3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NarutoShippudenUltimateNinjaStorm3">Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> With the ability to instant awaken, Choji's easily one of the strongest fighters in the game in his War Arc costume.

While it can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">effective</a> if used properly, and carries a whole lot more grenades than any other ZAKU that has them as a weapon (TWENTY grenades compared to eight carried by Lunamaria's Gunner ZAKU or four for the regular ZAKU Warrior, with or without the Gunner Pack), it's generally easier and better to use an actual combat machine.
<ul><li> Built on in <em>SD Generation Wars</em> where her Zaku literally has no attacks of her own and simply consist of her ordering other Zakus to attack before waving. Unlike the one in RvZII, this version is not viable in actual combat because its single attack has an absurdly low hit rate and damage.

He has Hank's moveset, but only about 40 health, in a game where average health is around 300. This is made even worse by the fact that Hank is designed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> — and Henchman does less damage, to boot. This is deliberate, since he's a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/MadnessCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/MadnessCombat">Madness Combat</a></em> character famous for having mooks which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine">Made of Plasticine</a>.

In the Japanese version he has a partner, but to avoid spoilers Ponygon doesn't have one in the English version. What does that mean? Since a partner is required to use a spell, Ponygon can only use melee attacks, and while they serve decent damage, spells are the main damage dealers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a> Isuka</em> has the Goon Squad.

Sandbag from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> is one such character, purely existing to be a sandbag to train on.

One is a weakling old man whose motto before the fight is "Let me Win! I lost so many times I forgot [sic] how winning feels like" and has 1 win by knockout and 99 losses, while the second, with slightly better stats of 17 wins - 12 losses pretty much just stands around waiting for you to beat him up until he taunts, or if you punch him in the face he will go for a "bear hug" attack that is pretty much easily dodgeable and opens up his guard.
<ul><li> That being said, come the Wii version, Bear Hugger got a little more threatening with an unpunchable stomach and and a tricky hook that requires you to dodge in one direction only, not to mention the "bear hug" is now a much more dangerous move.

Capcom denies this, stating Tofu was not originally envisioned to be a playable character or even a tofu, rather it was a block the developers made to test hit detection for the game. They decided to take the joke and run with it after main development was done.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoItemUseForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoItemUseForYou">Medieval Mode</a>, where he isn't allowed any of these things, he becomes a joke character nobody plays as except when they're trolling, due to his low speed and health. He does get a saving grace with his special melee weapons, such as the Gunslinger (which gives him extra HP and causes an automatic critical hit when striking thrice in a row), the Southern Hospitality (which causes bleed on hit and has its secondary weakness nullified by a lesser amount of fire) or the Eureka Effect (which lets him teleport back to spawn).
<ul><li> Speaking of fire, Pyro. While his role in the main game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">hotly</a> contested (and his role in Mann vs Machine even more so), he is considered an overall lesser pick in Medieval Mode because, like Engi, his main abilities (flanking and fire damage) are gone. He is slightly better than Engineer, seeing as he has more health and a number of his melee weapons have decent uses; the Sharpened Volcano Fragment sets people on fire with every swing, the Axtinguisher can crit people who are set on fire by a Huntsman-wielding Sniper, and the Backscratcher deals more damage and heals Pyro more from the small health kits everyone drops on death (and sometimes the Hot Hand if they're just messing around). Otherwise, Pyro has a history of questionable melee weapons, not a good start for a gamemode where they and arrows are your only means of attack.

Model a is an 8-bit version of the main character's default mode, and has exactly two powers: a shot, the weakest attack in the game (or at least on par with the basic attack), and a slide. It also moves slowly compared to every other form in the game, <em>including</em> unarmored, has a low jump, can't wallslide... just there for the nostalgia.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">Robot Buddy</a> duo Heavy and Bomb in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnucklesChaotix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnucklesChaotix">Knuckles Chaotix</a></em>. Since your partner is selected via crane game, there's about a 1-in-3 chance you'll pick up either one of these two. Heavy inhibits your movement by slowing and weighing you down, even when using the rubber-band speed boosts, and Bomb will explode if it gets hit, costing you all of your Rings if you get caught in the blast (and you most likely will). <em>Playing</em> as Heavy or Bomb, however, can turn them into Lethal Joke Characters, as they're invulnerable to enemy attacks, destroying common enemies by merely touching them. They just have a limited range of movement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMeatBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMeatBoy">Super Meat Boy</a></em> gives us Tofu Boy, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> aimed at PETA; you play him by typing "PETAphile" at the character select screen. He can't even complete most levels due to being slow and barely able to jump.
</li><li> Grey Ogmo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jumper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jumper">Jumper</a> Three</em> is slow, jumps low, has a special ability that only slows him down, and you get him <em>very</em> late in the game. Plus, you need to commit suicide when you actually get him. He has <em>the</em> highest skid-jumping in the game, but that's not going to be useful for the next two stages.
</li><li> The various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoAdaptationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoAdaptationGame">Lego Adaptation Games</a></em> pride themselves on this due to their feature of making <em>every</em> character who appears in each game, good or bad, available for free play. Yes this includes the useless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Gonk Droid</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Penguin Minion</a>. One notable subversion however is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Mr. DNA</a>, who is a firm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> with access to almost <em>every character ability in the game</em>.

<ul><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo">Gran Turismo</a></em> games have at least one car so ludicrously underpowered its only use is to laugh at its slowness. The first game is rather low key, with the 86 hp Mazda Demio being the weakest car, but <em>GT2</em> started playing this one with the 32 hp Daihatsu Midget and the <em>25 hp</em> Fiat 500R. The fourth game finally upped (downed?) the ante with the Benz Motorwagen and the Daimler Motor Carriage, the first internal combustion vehicles in history, <em>both of them barely reaching a SINGLE horsepower!</em>
<ul><li> Adding to that is the Ford Model T. Although it's not as underpowered as the Motorwagen and Motor Carriage, to unlock the Model T, you have to receive ALL GOLDS in the super license tests- one of which requires you to do an almost perfect lap around the Nordschleife.
</li><li> Of course, these aren't necessarily there for the humor value. The franchise is marketed as "the ultimate driving simulator", and the target audience (especially hard-core motorheads) may appreciate the opportunity to get behind the wheel of one of the Great Old Ones (no, not <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">those</a></em> Great Old Ones!).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a>: Maximum Tune</em> has a secret code that allows one to select the Toyota Celsior, also known as the Lexus LS 400 in North America. While the car itself isn't a joke at 250 stock horsepower, it's a luxury car and not a racing car, and its basic tuning has useless "ricer" parts and comments such as "Chrome tails confuse the enemy!"
<ul><li> <em>WMMT2</em> also has a code to select the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Hiace">Toyota HiAce<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> van/bus and the Corolla coupe.
</li><li> <em>WMMT3</em> has another code to select a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_cars">kei car<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It begins with 64 stock horsepower, and after one tuning step it, like other cars, jumps straight to 300 horsepower. In other words: adding a turbo to the car <em>adds 236 horsepower</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InitialDArcadeStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InitialDArcadeStage">Initial D Arcade Stage</a></em> has the Toyota AE85 Levin, which is basically a crappy version of the AE86.
<ul><li> <em>Arcade Stage 6 AA</em> also adds a Prius, which doesn't belong in a game about drifting. AT ALL.
</li><li> In <em>Arcade Stage 7 AA X</em>, the Suzuki Cappuccino, a vehicle which was previously the lightest and one of the fastest vehicles in the game (but balanced out with poor acceleration), received loads of nerfing in its speed, classifying it as a Joke Character.
</li><li> The Honda Civic EG6 can also be considered this in the first game, where it suffers from poor acceleration after 160 km/h and understeers frequently. It was later buffed in Version 2, where it's one of the best vehicles in the rain, and later nerfed in Version 3, where it's pretty much only all that useful on Happogahara.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Burnout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Burnout">Burnout</a></em> has a city bus as a vehicle. It's as long as three regular cars, in a game that is all about tight cornering and zipping nimbly through gaps in traffic.
</li><li> Mr. EAD in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a></em> games. Oh, yeah, he's got an A grade boost, but an E in body and a D in grip, meaning he can't keep speed, he can't take hits, and he doesn't corner very well either. All of his stats are practically nonexistent, as well. His machine, the Great Star, was designed with utter disregard to pilot safety because Mr. EAD is a robot, so it's not that big a deal, but <em>damn</em> is it fragile.
<ul><li> The Great Star is also a Flying Brick (Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Superman's Super Powers</a>) at its weight, and with that terrible Grip, it's gonna go wall ramming. Using EAD? Good luck.
</li><li> Daigoroh's Silver Rat has one thing going for it, and that's acceleration. On the other hand, it has the lowest top speed in the game. Its boost may be A-ranked, but it lasts for such a short time that it's not any good anyway, and every one eats up a huge portion of the Silver Rat's already very small energy bar.
</li><li> The Golden Fox in the first game. Just like the Silver Rat, it has excellent acceleration but the lowest top speed in the game. On the higher difficulties, some races are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> when using it because you literally <em>can't catch up</em> to the AI drivers even if you play <em>perfectly</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The classic PS1 game <em>3Xtreme</em> had aliens, monsters and toy cars as joke characters.
</li><li> The Bugatti Veyron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a> ProStreet</em>. In real life, this is the second-fastest car in the <em>world</em> (253 MPH top speed) and they put it in a sim-racing game that's mainly about racing tuned Golfs and RX-7s and even GT-spec Aston Martins, Porsches and Lamborghinis. It is also only obtainable through a hack (formerly buyable DLC) in the PC version or by buying the car online for the console versions. So you put down the cash and... it handles like a freaking land barge. Due to simulated physics, you can go fast in the straights, but good luck getting the car to turn. Oh, did I mention that you can't actually tune it? And that this is a tuner game? Whoops.
<ul><li> The Veyron averts Joke Car status in <em>Need for Speed Most Wanted (2012)</em> by virtue of its extreme speed and weight making it a great battering ram for taking down opponents (the boat-like handling is still there, though). Instead, this game has as its Joke Car the Ford Focus ST. In a game all about driving and crashing half-million-plus dollar exotics capable of 200+ MPH, this car is...a rather ordinary four-door hatchback. Like the ones you see on the road everyday. It only gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">better</a> when you consider that you have to "ear"n it first by winning 5 events in Ford vehicles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReVolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReVolt">Re-Volt</a></em> has the Pest Control. Sure, it is a Semi-Pro class vehicle and has one of the highest top speeds in the game, but it has boat-like handling and grip, can get pummeled by weapons easily, and its acceleration is abysmal. In fact, if the A.I. ever is seen with this vehicle, they are usually STRUGGLING to keep up with the much faster vehicles, including some BELOW its vehicle class.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HydroThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HydroThunder">Hydro Thunder</a></em> has a hovercraft (which is very difficult to maneuver), a military boat, a fishing boat with an outboard motor and "The Tinytanic".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ForzaMotorsport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ForzaMotorsport">Forza Motorsport</a> 4</em> features several cars which have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">absolutely no reason to be in a racing game</a>, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Toyota Prius, Nissan Leaf, and Chevrolet Volt</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">Ford Pinto</a>, and AMC Pacer. Most are incapable of being competitive even with the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment">extensive customization system</a>. On the other hand, a few become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Characters</a> with careful upgrade choices, such as the Pinto becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">Leaderboard car</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetMoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetMoto">Jet Moto</a></em>, the Butterfinger team members all have hideously poor performance.
</li><li> The console versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashNitroKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashNitroKart">Crash Nitro Kart</a></em> have Fake Crash, who is 2/7 in top speed, acceleration, and handling. This is in contrast to the Game Boy Advance and N-Gage versions, where he has near-perfect stats, and his depiction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing">Crash Team Racing</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacingNitroFueled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacingNitroFueled">Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled</a></em>, where he has the same stats as Crash.

<ul><li> With the Neon Circus update, if you found all five Golden Eggs throughout the five Adventure Mode hubs, you unlocked King Chicken, a chicken with a crown on his head. He has no personality to speak of and his win/lose animations on the final podium are him eating bird seed because, after all, he's just an ordinary chicken.
</li><li> The March 2020 updated added a character who was so secret they're not even listed on the Character Select like every other locked character. To unlock them, you need to find an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">incredibly well-hidden</a> Beenox Crate on all 49 tracks in the game. Do this, and you unlock... the Iron Checkpoint Crate, an inanimate metal box with a C painted on it from one secret path in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped">the third game</a>.

The exception is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Forgotten</span>, who is unique but also quite powerful.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">???

Any items that give permanent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer">Heart Containers</a> instead give plain soul hearts. This makes taking Devil Deals costly and health management in general take a lot more care. To add to that, his starting item is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor">The Poop</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">which lets him poop once a room</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Lost</span> takes the above a step further - he has <em>no</em> hearts at all. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder">One hit and the run is over</a>. This makes a comical number of items literally worthless, although thankfully he can take Devil Deals for free. Completing the game as The Lost unlocks some of the best items, so you better get good at dodging.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Keeper</span> swaps out the standard health system for coins, which can be replenished with money pickups instead of hearts. However, each coin heart is lost in one hit no matter what, he can't use soul hearts at all, and he can't gain more than his starting two. They also still count as red hearts, so he doesn't even get the side benefits the other two have with items that require you to have no red hearts.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> has a few:
<ul><li> While Magikarp is usually helpful due to being able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">evolve into Gyarados</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonPlatinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonPlatinum">Pokémon Platinum</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pokémon Black 2 and White 2</a></em> allow them to be found at Level 100, which prevents them from evolving into Gyarados and leaves the player with a useless Pokémon.
</li><li> Luvdisc has a Base Stat Total of 330, the sixth-lowest in the game of any fully evolved Pokémon, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">most of that is in Speed</a>. When you're fully evolved and your only stat that's better than a Bulbasaur is Speed, something is going dreadfully wrong. The only final-stage Pokémon with lower base stats have gimmicks that make up for them - the closest thing Luvdisc has to a gimmick is that it's a comparatively easy source of rare Heart Scales, and even then, there are often other ways to obtain them. Other than that, its typing, movepool, and abilities are some of the most generic in the game. In <em>X/Y</em>, an NPC at a Pokémon Center will also trade a <em>freaking Steelix</em> for a Luvdisc. A <em>powerful giant steel snake for a heart-shaped fish.</em> <br/>Generation 5 introduced Alomomola, which also happens to be a heart-shaped fish with a similar color and design. When it was first revealed, fans everywhere thought it would be an evolution for Luvdisc and it would finally be good for something. As it turned out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Alomomola had no evolutions or pre-evolutions</a> and Luvdisc remains useless to this day.
</li><li> Spinda, which has a similar problem, only without the decent Speed. It probably says something about Luvdisc that Spinda's attack strength is <em>double</em> that of Luvdisc...and still horrible. Spinda's primary purpose in the game is similar to the below Unown's, although it's not nearly as well known: each and every Spinda has a unique pattern of spots. (Well, okay, technically there are only <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Spinda_(Pokemon)#Trivia">4,294,967,296<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> different Spinda spot patterns.) One new Ability in <em>Black/White</em>, Contrary, reverses stat changes for the Pokémon, and Spinda is one of the few to have this Ability. Doesn't really put it in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> status, as it doesn't really have any good moves to use it with...but at least it has Skill Swap, which lets it gain a niche in doubles granting this ability to stronger Pokémon (most frequently Arcanine).
</li><li> Chimecho, who was a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> to find when it was first introduced in <em>R/S/E</em>. It has a 2% chance of appearing at the summit of Mt. Pyre, a story location well off the beaten path that you aren't likely to go back to, in a patch of grass you have to be actively looking for. You'd think it's some great rare Pokémon, or at least has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a>, right? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare">Nope</a></em>. Its only decent stat is Special Attack, and that's not enough to redeem its limited movepool and bland typing. Compounding this is the existence of Gardevoir, Alakazam, and Grumpig, three much better Psychic types whose pre-evolutions are available much earlier, and are much easier to find. The only attention it got in later games was a "baby" pre-evolution, Chingling, which lets it be found much earlier but still doesn't make it any stronger.
</li><li> Unown, whose only learned move, Hidden Power, is of unknown type, determined by an intricate number manipulation involving values to which you normally wouldn't have access. And it comes in 28 different flavors! Collectors can seek out all 28 forms (about all they're good for), but they probably won't be used for battle. And lest you make the mistake of believing that Unown is potentially worth using for that move (the move's main use is obtaining odd move types on a mon that could not otherwise learn, and even then it is so much of a pain to set up that it only gets used in simulators where it can be picked from a menu instead of excessive inbreeding), <em>every Pokémon in the game capable of using TMs can learn it too</em>, and the only Pokémon aside from weak species like Magikarp that <em>can't</em> use TMs are gimmicky things (like Unown) anyway. Not to mention that Unown isn't the only Pokémon that can learn it without a TM. Shellos and Gastrodon can do that as well, the difference being that it isn't the only move they can learn. If you were to catch an Unown that gets a Psychic-type Hidden Power (for STAB), optimum IVs and EVs to power it up, and a held item to increase it further...<em>it would still suck</em>.
</li><li> There's also Farfetch'd, which has exactly two things going for it: a personal item that greatly increases its chance of getting a critical hit, and the fact that it looks cool. The personal item really doesn't matter, considering its stats are so bad that it will still be a weak hit even with a critical, and that's if it can survive long enough to hit anything. In the original Red and Blue versions of Pokémon, you can only get Farfetch'd by trading with an in-game character for it (Yellow Version however lets you catch them in the wild, as do Gold, Silver, and Crystal). As fans of the series know, a Pokémon obtained via trade cannot have its nickname changed. For this reason, no one in the entire country owned a Farfetch'd that didn't have the inane nickname "DUX". <br/>As of the sixth generation, Farfetch'd's Stick (the personal item mentioned above) has been vastly buffed, now giving Farfetch'd a whopping <em>50%</em> chance of a critical hit. There are moves that have twice the normal critical hit rate, and Farfetch'd gets four of these of different typings; combine the two and this means every hit with Farfetch'd will be a critical, making it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> if you can get around the fact that its stats are still awful. (Although, seeing as you can get it right before the first Gym - which is Insect-themed - and it knows Aerial Ace - it might be <em>very</em> useful right there.) <br/><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em> finally gives Farfetch'd a long-awaited evolution in Sirfetch'd, but it's technically only the evolution of its regional variant Galarian Farfetch'd, meaning base Farfetch'd is still stuck as a gimmick character.
</li><li> Delibird seems to be an experiment by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak">Game Freak</a> to create the worst Pokémon of all time. Its Ice/Flying type leaves it with only 2 resistances and one immunity, compared to four weaknesses (including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">4X weakness to Rock</a>). Its base stat total is the same as <em>Luvdisc</em>. It only learns a single move by leveling up (and it's a terrible move with low accuracy and variable damage, with a chance to <em>heal the opponent</em>). This means that it has to rely on TM, move tutor, and egg moves alone. It barely learns any special moves outside of Ice type, meaning it has to rely on its inferior physical attack. Abilities? It gets one that lowers accuracy to get a boost in attack, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">two abilities</a> that prevent sleep. Which means it can't heal up with Rest (but why would you when your defenses and HP are only <em>45</em>?). Not to mention it's also a bitch to catch (although the only people who would <em>want</em> to are those trying to complete the Pokedex) in Generation 2 because it has a 50/50 chance of fleeing every turn and rarely appears in one cave. The one saving grace it has is that it can learn Aerial Ace (combined with Hustle, it's boosted without the chance of missing). In Generation VII, it gains the ability to learn Drill Peck via level-up, possibly in an attempt to make it slightly more useful. It's like Game Freak regrets adding this guy to the game or something...
</li><li> Nearly every Joke Character in Pokémon has some sort of strange gimmick. Chatot interacts with the DS microphone with its move Chatter by copying anything the player says (or at least used to, that feature was dropped since Gen VI in exchange for a much deserved buff), Smeargle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">can learn any move in the game through Sketch</a>, Plusle and Minun have an interaction in double battles, etc. Sometimes a gimmick allows one of these to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a>; most of the time, they are stuck being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">Tier-Induced Scrappy</a>.
</li><li> In a case of a specific <em>incarnation</em> of a Pokemon being one of these, there's the Plusle you get from Duking in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a></em>. Normally, Plusle is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyBard">Quirky Bard</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonderTwinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WonderTwinPowers">requiring to pair up with Minun in order to reach its full potential</a>, but outside of that, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>. In <em>Colosseum</em>, however, not only is Minun not available in the game itself (the only way you can get one being through trading from one of the Gen III games, which is locked until you beat the main game), but the Plusle's stats are <em>horrendous</em>, and on top of that, right outside of the building Duking gives you him is a trainer with a Shadow Flaaffy, which has <em>much</em> better stats.
</li><li> In the first generation, Ditto was considered literally useless, as it took a full turn to use Transform (its only move). As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">it had horrible stats all-around</a>, it was very likely that it would die before it even got a move off, and once it had, you were basically now a copy of your opponent but with terrible HP (between Ditto's own terrible HP and no doubt taking a hit already). A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">solo run</a> with Ditto was considered effectively impossible. On top of that, Mew received Transform as well, so Ditto wasn't even unique in that niche. The second generation made it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a> by giving it odd breeding properties, and the fifth buffed it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> by giving it the Imposter ability.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerQuest">Power Quest</a></em> has BOROT, a character who not only lacks any special attacks but is incapable of performing basic maneuvers like blocking, jumping and crouching.
</li><li> Edward from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> has pitiful stats in everything except speed; then again, one of his character abilities is to run and hide. The DS remake improves him to the point where he's legitimately as useful as characters like Rosa and Yang.
<ul><li> And in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIVTheAfterYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIVTheAfterYears">the sequel</a>, with the right equipment and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">some leveling</a>, he'll be your fastest character, hitting as hard as your tanks (or <em>harder</em>) from the back row, and able to heal the whole party almost instantly to full health (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">his HP and defense still stink, though</a>). And with a little luck, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic">Bardsong</a> can either buff your whole party or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">debuff</a> the enemies, all for 0 MP with no charge time. His secretary Harley, on the other hand, takes over the joke character slack that Edward left behind.
</li><li> The GBA version lacks the inherent usefulness of Bardsong that the DS remake has...but late game, where you can pick Edward up again, his stats explode rapidly, to where he'll be one of your fastest characters and one-shotting most Dragon-type enemies you'll encounter.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em> has Ludmila, who's charge attack is based on whatever animation the game decides to play. Only two of its five possible outcomes will actually do anything beneficial for the player.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em> had Adray Lasbard and Mirage Koas - again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">both powerful characters</a> who were nonetheless clearly identifiable as bonus characters added to the original release; they came so late and at such a low level they were a lot of trouble to bother leveling up. This was enhanced by the fact that both of them were slightly stat-fiddled versions of previously existing characters (Sophia and Cliff, respectively) who were just as good or better and were gotten early in the game.
</li><li> Depending on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGameForThePriceOfTwo">which version of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Robopon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Robopon">Robopon</a> 2</em> you have, most battery combinations will yield either a Gear or a Bulbot. Both of these monsters are worthless because they have weak stats, and unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Magikarp and Feebas</a>, they don't get any better at all.
</li><li> Every monster from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a></em> series has a joke sub-species.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthbound">Earthbound</a></em> has several joke characters that join the party for brief periods, most notably Picky and Pokey in the very beginning, who basically do nothing but waste time during battle with dopey moves that do nothing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys">Salsa</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>. He has atrocious attacking power, low defense, and very mediocre abilities, with only one having any real use. He's also the character you control for the entirety of chapter 3, though you thankfully have more competent characters backing you up whenever you need to battle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halcyon6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halcyon6">Halcyon 6</a></em> gives you Bucky Rogers the Super Soldier. His primary distinction is the fact he cannot pilot any ship except for the weak and useless Shuttle. He does have a decent selection of ground-based powers, but then again your regular officers will gain those as they progress (and since most of an officer's experience is gained via space combat, Bucky will be outleveled by anyone unless you grind him intensely with station tasks or the starbase gets invaded often enough to give him more chances to gain Experience from ground combat).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> has the companions Davin and Miria. A brother and a sister, they're recruited automatically in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">Shotgun Wedding</a> if the player sleeps with one of them. They have bottom-level stats, can't be given orders, and don't level up. Pretty much the only way they'll survive the events of the game is either divorcing them or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">selling them into slavery.</a>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona">Persona</a></em> series gives us Decarabia, who, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">fourth</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">fifth</a> games is weak to <em>physical attacks,</em> meaning any enemy can knock you down for extra turns if you use it. While it can be fused to resist or nullify physical attacks, its other attributes aren't anything to write home about (aside from having the very useful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">Tetrakarn</a> skill), so it'll probably end up being fusion fodder for other, better Personas.

For example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster">Slime</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV">Shin Megami Tensei IV</a></em> is weak to everything except Gun and Dark attacks, including basic physical attacks.

<ul><li> Merlin Prismriver in <em>Phantasmagoria of Flower View</em>. Horrible stats, the worst scope in the game, slanted shots that only make it difficult to hit things, and her only half decent attack is the one you can't control. The good news is that she doesn't have a storyline, so she's mostly there as a handicap for experienced players.

Very weak firepower even at maximum, encouraging the player to get close to the bosses in a <em>bullet hell</em> just to deal decent damage - and even then, only Alice and Reimu have less firepower<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1yewa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1yewa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1yewa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Alice's shot doesn't spread, making shotgunning pointless for her.

Her only redeeming quality is her ability to cover a wide area... except that Yuyuko can do the exact same thing without any of the above drawbacks. And unless you're playing extra, Yuyuko gets more bombs than Sakuya, just to rub it in further.

<ul><li> <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TempleOfElementalEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TempleOfElementalEvil">Temple of Elemental Evil</a></em> features three joke characters, Ted, Ed and Ed.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook">Sourcebook</a> <em>Bloodlines: The Legendary</em>, there is a Mekhet bloodline called the Players. They're essentially one giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at vampire groupies - their origins lie with a vampire who was obsessed with Hollywood. Their weakness is monstrously crippling - it's much easier for them to get dramatic failures on mental-based Disciplines (of which all but <em>four</em> qualify), and if they do, the target is <em>permanently</em> immune. On top of that, their Viniculums, eternal blood slave bonds, last a ridiculously short time. They're such jokes, in fact, that other vampires are mildly <em>scared</em> of them - something that weak and laughable could not be an accident...
</li><li> The tabletop fantasy football game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl">Blood Bowl</a></em> (and its PC adaptation) has several, all sitting at the bottom of the tier lists and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> in the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavourText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavourText">Flavour Text</a>:
<ul><li> Halflings are certainly treated as the worst team ever in the game's fluff and are one of the worst teams in gameplay. About every halfling game mentioned in the rulebook involves downright slaughter of the entire halfling team, and one particularly famous incident had a halfling team failing to win a match against an opponent <em>who didn't show up</em>. Halflings are so bad, they can't even win by default. The PC adaptation treats merely managing to coach a team of halflings through a game without every single one of them being killed as a feat of coaching excellence on par with, if not exceeding, leading a more conventional team to victory.
</li><li> Goblin teams are treated almost equally badly. Not only are they a complete gimmick team that tends to hurt themselves as much as they hurt the other team, in the fluff the main consensus of the Blood Bowl community is that they're only allowed to play because the alternative (leaving the goblin teams, coaches and supporters with nothing better to do) would probably be worse for society at a whole.
</li><li> Previous editions of the game had the snotling teams. Snotlings have strength 1 (the lowest possible by the game's rules) and armour 5 (not the lowest <em>possible</em>, but the lowest default on any player in the game), will die if another player so much as looks at them funny, and are treated lorewise as the ones even <em>goblins</em> look down on. Their advantage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">was that snotlings cost 10,000 gold each</a> and each snotling only took half a player slot, allowing you to field 22 snotlings at any time. In the current edition snotlings have teamed up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">the ogres</a> for a team, ogre teams themselves being a (borderline) example of this trope that can barely outplay halflings and goblins and being mostly famed for having <em>two</em> players who weren't complete garbage (Bob and Morg'n'Thorg).

It has all the weaknesses of a standard frog, and none of the advantages. To date, their weaknesses include: Not being able to change into human form, not being able to breathe underwater, having to spend 12 hours a day in water, and only being able to mate with human women. Their available skills? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Strength</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Magic</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Poison</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> franchise has the Chaos Spawn; humans that devolved into beasts which are used as cannon fodder or kept as pets. Due to being insane, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">move randomly</a>, wandering around the map at various (mostly slow) speeds until they hopefully stumble into enemy units... and on top of that, they have a high point cost, lowish stats, and aren't particularly good in melee, so even if they do manage to engage the opponent, they usually suck against them. Indeed, it was calculated that the only unit a Chaos Spawn could make up its point cost against are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Fire Warriors</a></em>, and even then, not always. They did get a major buff in the 6th edition of <em>40K</em>, making them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a>.
<ul><li> The Tyranid Pyrovore is by and large useless. It's designed as a close-assault unit, with a template weapon to take out enemy units hiding in cover... provided it ever gets there, as it moves far too slowly for a dedicated assault army (which is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">bread and butter</a> of the 'Nids). Its close-combat abilities are subpar (worse than unaugmented humans), it can easily be killed by small arms fire, and it has the unfortunate tendency to violently explode and kill any friendly models that happen to be too close. Finally, the Pyrovore is an Elite choice, competing with the psychic powerhouse Zoanthropes and tank-killing Hive Guard (among others), many of which are considered staples in Tyranid lists. The only saving grace of the Pyrovore is that its model looks cool, causing players to use the models to proxy for the silly looking (but infinitely more useful) Biovore. It was buffed heavily in 8th edition, got a massive cost reduction, and lost the friendly fire effect, but it still sees little play just because its role isn't all that useful even when it does it well (and Biovores are still better).
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em>, practically any gully dwarf character. Gully dwarves are the half-breed children of dwarves and gnomes, missing everything that makes dwarves cool. Gully dwarves have no land of their own and often live in refuse heaps, sewers and backalleys in the more run-down cities of other races, and most of them are so stupid that they can barely count to two (some can count to three; these tend to be the shamans and leaders among the gully dwarves, though these individuals are still stupid enough to be often found licking ale off the tavern floors). Stupid, cowardly, hideous, obnoxious and generally unpleasant to be around, it's quite baffling why anyone would want to roll a gully dwarf unless they clearly just wanted a laugh at the game.

They lack any class features (aside from the adept, which has a weak spell list and a familiar) and only have their base attack, HD, and skill progression to go on, and even those are usually subpar. It's still possible to play one, but anyone doing so is either doing so for weird roleplay purposes or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">Cherry Tapping</a>. The weakest of the bunch is the commoner, which has the worst possible numbers in HD, skills, base attack, and saves, and no unique abilities to back it up (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">unless your DM lets April Fools material fly at the table</a>).

While it gets some slight benefits, its main gimmick is having a chance of rolling on a d100 table any time it casts a spell, most of the table's results being increasingly bizarre effects such as turning yourself into a potted plant, ageing forward or backward 10 years, poisoning everyone around you, summoning a group of Flumphs that are afraid of you or growing "a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face". Oh, and the DM has the option to make you roll on this table <em>whenever they want</em>. Probably not meant for serious play, but <em>great</em> for comedy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>, the Blazing Torchbearer Archetype (Class Variation) trades three very useful Alchemist abilities (Crafting potions, using poisons and one discovery) for the incredible abilities of...making torches last forever (where the loosest of change would buy you a supply to last the entire game), increasing the lighting radius of torches (at a level where you'll have better light sources anyway), producing a flash which turns everyone around him blind (including himself) once per day, and making melee attacks which inflict less damage than he would do with a bomb, which as an alchemist he has a large supply of and can use them at range. The manual does specify that this archetype is meant for torchbearer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> which don't even see much combat to begin with.

Jogurt has 1 hit point, his attacks do 1 damage each, and he has a magic ring that turns adjacent allies into hamsters like him - and then breaks, every time. If, somehow, you have Jogurt kill enough enemy units to level him up, he remains at level 1 and gains no stats or abilities. Jogurt can also be promoted right away - again, with no increase in stats.

However he starts at level one, can barely do scratch damage to the enemies you're currently facing and will die in one hit. Did I mention he also doesn't speak? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">He just repeats his name</a>, so you won't even get any cool backstory or conversation out of this.

In a game where you can't carry allies and featuring the largest maps in the franchise, Arden, the only playable Armor unit, tends to struggle with just keeping up with his allies, much less getting to fight anything. As a result, about half his dialogue is just him grumbling about how slow he is and how he could definitely pull his weight if they wouldn't all run ahead of him. He does obtain the power of Pursuit, but most players just give the ring to someone else.

While this class does have some tertiary bonuses (a crit boost for Ross and Amelia, being able to use all three offensive magic types for Ewan), it doesn't upgrade their terrible Constitution at all, and its stat gains are no better (if not worse) than the "real" classes they should promote into. It's especially useless on Ross, who can gain a crit bonus through an actual good class, and uses extremely heavy axes that makes him want to leave his terrible base Constitution as early as possible. Funniest of all, the "Super Trainee" keeps the animations of the original class, meaning you can train them up fully and see them clumsily flailing around and struggling to lift their weapons even while taking down giant monsters.

They all lack portraits and any kind of conversation, and have generic class bases and growths, making them essentially just fodder mooks that you can incidentally control. Even their names are pulled from a list, and most of those names are just numbers. Nailing it home further, the North American release added names like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">Wymp, Auffle, and Lucer</a> to the pool.
</li></ul></li><li> Early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> games tend to put some of the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robot</a> support units in this category, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Boss Borot, Aphrodite A</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo">Getter-Q</a>, mostly because they'd either be around for one stage, just be re/re units (basically healers and re-suppliers), be completely pathetic stat-wise or all three. As Banpresto started to move away from this, the units got better - Boss Borot, for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeALevelInBadass">took many levels in badass</a> throughout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> era of games - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAdvance">Super Robot Wars Advance</a></em> gives Boss the Borot Pressure Punch, which gives him a ranged attack.

Then came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment">Super Robot Wars Judgment</a></em> which shifts him to his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaiser</a></em> counterpart and makes him so much better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a></em> features Unusually Ruthless Reuben, who has terrible stats and terrible starting equipment<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3mrtx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3mrtx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3mrtx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His shooting stat starts at 35, in a game where anything under 50 is dangerous to attempt, and his starting equipment doesn't include a <em>gun</em>, but instead two completely worthless items</span>, with his only redeeming factor being an insanely low daily cost.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance2">Jagged Alliance 2</a></em> has several joke characters. The mercenaries you can hire through AIM are all varying degrees of helpful in some way or another, but the mercenaries offered through MERC are by and large hot garbage: Biff, the so-called star of the line up, has stats well below acceptable and a low wisdom score, meaning that his stats take longer to increase. He also might randomly quit if he kills someone, and panics very easily. The other mercenaries are no better, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Flo and Gumpy</a> the only potentially useful offerings because of their very high wisdom stats, which mean they <em>can</em> improve quickly, but still require a lot of investment before they are anywhere close to par.
</li><li> The joke <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> BalanceGoldPrime++ is known for making just about every civilization <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered">Purposefully Overpowered</a> by multiplying all their traits by 10 - meaning that, for instance, America now sees halfway across the map and gets money back for buying tiles, and the Zulus now instantly promote their units to the maximum level. And then there's India, whose trait was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCity">decreased unhappiness for city population</a>... and <em>increased</em> unhappiness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">for number of cities.</a> Because of this, India's single starting city generates enough misery to put the population in revolt. Sure, they now <em>gain</em> happiness for higher population, but as one of the downsides of low happiness is decreased population growth, and since all your neighbors are now basically gods, you're not exactly likely to get there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Advance Wars 2</a></em> and <em>Dual Strike</em> have Flak and Jugger, both of whom are regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Starter Villains</a> in their debut games. In the game, one statistic is "dispersion" - basically, whenever you attack, your attacks do a random, very small amount of damage greater than the predicted amount (maxing at 10% more). Flak and Jugger both have a much higher dispersion, meaning that their attacks have a chance to deal much greater damage... or much <em>less</em> damage. And their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">CO Powers</a> just make that spread <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">even bigger</a>; sure, you can take down a tank with an infantry, but you can also attack an infantry with a tank and lose the tank. Playing with Flak and Jugger is basically a catastrophic failure waiting to happen. And on top of that, Nell, an unlockable CO, has the exact same ability, only in exchange for having a lower spread than either, she never does less damage than predicted, meaning she basically does the same thing but better.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletech">Battletech</a></em> video game features the Cicada CDA-2A, a medium 'mech with a ridiculously oversized engine. It is capable of outrunning everything in the game short of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Locust</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">but the sheer weight of the engine leaves it with a mighty six tonnes of weight available for everything else</a>. The Cicada is physically incapable of maxing out its armour capacity or to mount the full amount of weapons that it has hardpoints for, nevermind getting even a decent amount of either... Especially given that one of its hardpoints is a ballistic hardpoint, with the lightest ballistic weapon weighing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWorksBetterWithBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWorksBetterWithBullets">exactly six tonnes without ammunition</a>. To add insult to injury it cannot even use its great speed to work as an evasion tank or a melee combatant, as its medium chassis and lack of arms means it's outdodged and outgunned by even the Spider, a 15-ton lighter 'mech.

</li><li> Interestingly enough, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim">Kamen Rider Gaim</a></em>, a series whose riders all had similarities to the riders of <em>Ryuki</em>, aired, the status of joke character went not to Scissors's <em>Gaim</em> counterpart, Hase/Kurokage, but rather, to the show's expy of Imperer, Jonouchi/Gridon; thanks to Gridon being absolutely incompetent in combat despite having slightly higher stats. Gridon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoRangers">New Generation Rider</a> counterpart, Sigurd, wasn't much better either, lacking the firepower, versatility, and combat experience that were possessed by Duke, Zangetsu Shin, and Marika, and being the only rider to fight Kouta intending to kill him and lose.

</li><li> In general, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> shows that use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance">Multiform Balance</a> will sometimes give their Riders a weaker form that is largely useless in combat.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga">Kamen Rider Kuuga</a></em> has Growing Form, the first form Yusuke transforms into. A white version of the regular Kuuga suit with smaller horns, it has all of the weaknesses of Kuuga's other forms, none of the strengths, lacks it's own weapon, and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>, the Growing Kick, is so weak that it needs to be used three times in a row to destroy just <em>one</em> monster. In contrast, some of Kuuga's other forms are so powerful that their finishing moves can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">wipe out entire city blocks</a> and his strongest form, Ultimate Kuuga, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllInTheManual">apparently</a> had the capacity to destroy the entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">planet</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO">Kamen Rider Den-O</a></em> has Plat Form (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Get it?</a> It's a train themed series). Den-O's other forms has Ryotaro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersViaPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersViaPossession">cede control of his body</a> over to the Taros so that they can use their strength and powers to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Imagin</a>, but Plat Form is one of two forms where he remains in control (the other being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Liner Form</a>) and is the only one where he must rely entirely on his own skills and abilities—which is to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">none at all.</a> Ryotaro assuming this form <em>always</em> ends with him receiving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">an asskicking.</a> It's worth noting that technically, <em>all</em> Den-O riders have this form, but Ryotaro is the only one who spends significant time in said form due to lacking a strong enough personality - all the other riders only transform into Plat Form for a few seconds before assuming their regular forms. Additionally, Ryotaro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Grandson From The Future</a>, Kotaro Nogami, uses the same belt, yet is able to access Strike Form, suggesting that if Ryotaro had a stronger personality, he'd go straight into Strike Form as opposed to being forced to use Plat Form.
</li><li> Although other series have similar pre-transformation forms (<em>Gaim</em> has the Ride Wear, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost">Kamen Rider Ghost</a></em> has Transient), they generally only appear during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence">Transformation Sequence</a>. The only other series with a form similar to Plat Form that the rider spends a notable amount of time in is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderRyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderRyuki">Kamen Rider Ryuki</a></em>, which has the Blank Form. Unlike the aforementioned Plat Form, however, the form can only be used if you don't have a contract with a mirror monster, or if your contract card is stolen. The form has only been shown for the titular Rider, Knight (which wasn't shown in-show, but was revealed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllInTheManual">in an art book</a>) and Ouja (his version was seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>). While you <em>can</em> use the cards from the deck, they're <em>much</em> weaker than cards from the deck of a rider who's contracted with a mirror monster - the form is strong enough to prevent you from immediately disintegrating in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone">Mirror Dimension</a>, but that's it.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> spoofed this in the Tiffany Haddish/Taylor Swift episode of 2017. One sketch had Haddish playing such a character named "Boo Boo Jeffries" in a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> like game. The character is a stereotypical black woman whose attacks consist entirely of her insulting her opponent or performing dance moves while repeating "Rihanna" or "Beyonce". She doesn't do well against her opponent. Unfortunately, the player (Keenan Thompson) is forced to use her because he chose her by accident.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> The Rider-class servant Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard - considering he's the most famous pirate in history, you'd expect him to be at least a 4-star story locked servant<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7exmu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7exmu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7exmu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">like Nero, Thomas Alva Edison, or Tristan</span>... instead, he's a two star you can summon from the friend point gacha. Admittedly, it's worth noting that stars alone do not determine how good a servant is, but stat-wise, he's an extremely watered down version of Francis Drake, being the same class and having a similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Noble Phantasm</a>, but he's <em>so</em> watered down that he doesn't even get the distinction of being seen as a budget version of her (like Lu Bu to Heracles)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lsx2');"><sup>explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0lsx2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lsx2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in <em>Fate/Grand Order</em>, you can use 5 servants and 1 support servant, with the limit to what servants you use being mana points; 1 stars cost 3 mana points, 2 stars cost 4, 3 stars cost 7, 4 stars cost 12, and 5 stars cost 16; "budget" servants are lower-cost versions of more expensive servants, both in terms of mana point cost and in terms of saint quartz cost, as it's easier to roll a 1-3 star than it is to roll a 4 or 5 star; additionally, <em>budget</em> servants usually allow for costlier Craft Essences to be equipped</span>. The game's story and events lampshade this, having him be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> in many scenes (his interlude has him searching for <em>doujins</em> of the aforementioned Francis Drake; during Saber Wars, his crotch is on the receiving end of Saber Lily's Caliburn).
</li><li> Of course, Angra Mainyu is even more of a joke than Blackbeard - he's an <em>Avenger-class</em> servant, yet he's easily one of the weakest servants in the game - both in comparison to other Avenger-class servants<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8m8u9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8m8u9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8m8u9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">to be fair, it's worth noting that Edmond Dantes and Jeanne Alter, who have the 4th highest and <em>the</em> highest attack stat in the game respectively, are also Avengers</span> and other servants in general. He's also the rarest thing you can roll in the friend-point gacha, yet stat-wise, he's no better than a two star (his actual star rating is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale">zero</a></em>). His Noble Phantasm in particular highlights this - you'd expect the NP belonging to all the worlds' evils to be one of the most powerful... yet it stuns him and requires the enemy to damage him; if all enemy servants spend the turn using skills or deal more damage to him than he can take, it's worthless. This is a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>, as well. In the lore of the series, Angra Mainyu was said to be so hideously weak that he barely even counted as a Servant, as in life he was basically just an unlucky peasant who got sacrificed because his village designated him as "all the world's evils." The one time he was ever summoned, he got killed almost immediately (which ended very badly, as no matter how weak he is, tossing the spirit of an embodiment of evil into your magic wish-granting device is a bad idea).
</li><li> Saber Lily herself is a bit infamous for being a relic of a very bad early design choice: namely, it was planned that the four-star "welfare" Servants given out for free would be worse than other Servants of their star rating. Thankfully, the whole idea was scrapped and most welfares since have ranged from decently strong to gamebreakingly strong, but that still left poor Lily with worse ATK and HP than three-star Sabers like Bedivere, Fergus, and Caesar, while also having the attendant risks of a four-star like higher party cost and requiring rare materials to level up. On top of that, she's saddled with very lackluster skills and abilities, and as players were initially only given one of her, her Noble Phantasm couldn't be raised past its first level. The Saber Wars event was essentially one long lampshading of how unimpressive she was, though it gave her a small buff in the form of finally letting her max out her Noble Phantasm.
</li><li> The Assassin Mata Hari has <em>abysmal</em> stats for a 1-star, no passive skills, and her active skills aren't very good. She even seems aware of this, since she's given up on having her wish granted by the Holy Grail. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">On the other hand</a>, she's actually one of the best choices against the <em>final boss</em> of the first story arc due to the fact that, as an Assassin, she deals bonus damage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9h9f3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9h9f3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9h9f3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the boss, Goetia, takes extra damage from and deals regular damage to Casters, Riders, Assassins, and Berserkers, but takes regular damage from and deals extra damage to Sabers, Lancers, and Archers</span>, and her third skill can seal the buffs that the boss gives himself.
</li><li> Rider-class servant Boudica does slightly better than the other 3 examples from this game, due to having the mildly useful Battle Continuation skill and high HP...the problem is that she has very poor attack (it's higher than Edward Teach's by 100 points), her first skill is pretty much useless out side of the singularity she debuts in<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10nm4d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10nm4d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10nm4d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">said skill is only effective against enemies with the Roman attribute, and enemies with said attribute only really appearing in the Septem Singularity...where she debuts; this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that, as a Rider, she doesn't get a class advantage against them; while Siegfried faces a similar problem with Dragon trait servants (the majority of whom are Rider class), he's very useful against the handful of Lancer-class enemies with the Dragon attribute as a Saber, and St. Georgios can give any enemy the dragon attribute for a few turns with his NP, thus saving him from this fate</span>, and while her NP would point to her being a good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>, the problem is that it's essentially a watered down version of Mash's — who not only is the first servant you get in the game, but she costs <em>0 MP</em> to use. As a result, she's often considered one of the worst servants in the game, to the point where some fans have been asking for another version of her in a different class to make up for her in this class. However, with the release of Romulus-Quirinus, a Servant with the ability to induce the "Roman" attribute as a Status Effect, Boudica would later find a niche as a support for that one single character (who ironically enough <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is the deified founder of Rome itself</span>).
</li><li> Jason, commander of the Argonauts and an early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, was made into the game's first 1-Star Saber for the game's fourth anniversary. While he has a decent set of support-focused skills his rarity means that he has the lowest stats of his class and his animations often involve getting caught in his fellow Argonauts' attacks. His NP has him call upon them to perform an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike">Alpha Strike</a>, only for Atalanta to deliberately punt him into the line of fire so that he has to run around dodging their attacks, culminating in him being blown into the stratosphere by Heracles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/SmashBrosLawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/SmashBrosLawl">Smash Bros. Lawl</a></em> has two of them:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer">The Irate Gamer</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Power Copying</a> in his Plagiarism ability, but they are weaker than the original skill: For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a> has the F-Bomb, which fires a cartoon bomb forward, while the Irate Gamer shoots a small firecracker that travels in a short arc. The rest of his attacks are pretty mediocre and more often than not end up hurting himself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has said outright that he's a joke character because he loves characters like Dan Hibiki.
</li><li> Best Hercules, from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> animated <em>Hercules</em> movie, has a whole moveset where all his attacks have a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of starting lag and if he whiffs, he ends up falling to the floor, defenseless. And his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Final Smash</a> will carry him offscreen if he fails to hit anything. In the official Tier List he even has the very bottom tier all for himself: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Best Tier</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>, we have G'nort, a dog-like alien who is the worst Green Lantern in existence. An incompetent moron who can barely use his power ring, his fellow Lanterns can't stand him and they often send him away on missions to isolated, lifeless sectors of space where he can't cause any trouble. This also carries over to his appearance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em> where he needs a <em>cheat sheet</em> in order to remember the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed">Green Lantern Oath.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneHundredPercentOrangeJuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneHundredPercentOrangeJuice">100% Orange Juice!</a></em>: has the playable versions of the enemy units: The Chicken, Seagull and Robo-ball have 3 HP, and two of their stats are -1, making them easy targets for the other players; However, they can compensate with +1 in their third stat (+1 DEF for Robo-ball. +1 EVA for the Chicken, and +1 ATK for the Seagull), and unlike normal units who give one half of their stars and 2 wins if defeated, the enemy units only give one quarter of their stars and 1 win.
</li><li> There is a Cat unit in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBattleCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBattleCats">The Battle Cats</a> named Killer Cat who is just as strong as the very first cat you get<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11gd1l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11gd1l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11gd1l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> said cat unit, simply named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADogNamedDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADogNamedDog">Cat</a>, even in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeToUnlockMoreTruePotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeToUnlockMoreTruePotential">True Form</a>, is quite weak in comparison to the other, much more powerful cats with his only use upon leaving early game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">being spammed as a meatshield</a> thanks to his low cost and quick recharge rate </span>, except he costs $7500 to spawn in battle (in a game where, if you fully upgrade your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit">Worker Cat</a> in battle, get wallet upgrades through the Cat Capsule and get all the treasures which increases your max wallet capacity, the maximum capacity of your wallet is $16500) making him a huge waste of cash should you try to use him in a battle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TierZoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TierZoo">TierZoo</a></em>, a web series that explains biology through gaming terms, has two cases of this.
<ul><li> Surprisingly, the supposedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> tardigrade/water bear is considered this. It's stated that it sacrificed all its stats and other traits in favor of taking huge amounts of heat, cold, vacuum, radiation and pressure resistances... without taking the extremophile trait, meaning that it has to go into "hibernation mode" if in extreme condition. All this, and the fact that it <em>doesn't</em> have resistance to physical damage, which most players use, makes it a bottom-tier character.
</li><li> Modern-day tree sloths are considered <em>the worst build in the game</em>. Any hostile encounter is practically a death sentence since they are extremely slow and have almost no attacking power. Their stealth ability is poor and only works when they're stationary in tree foliage. They need to descend to the ground in order to defecate, which makes them vulnerable to predators. Finally, they specced into (read: evolved to use) gut bacteria to allow them a nutrient-poor diet of leaves, and said bacteria die if temperatures drop low, causing the sloth to starve to death <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">even on a full stomach</a></em>. Harpy eagles even intentionally leave sloths alive so that their fledglings can use them as target practice. <em>However</em>, being a Joke Character did give them an advantage against humans as compared to its top-tier cousin, the giant ground sloth — since humans took no interest in hunting smaller arboreal animals, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">they didn't bother to hunt the tree sloths while the huge prehistoric sloths were hunted to extinction</a>.
</li><li> Domestic sheep are also considered this, due to having such low intelligence they can even be defeated by <em>bramble bushes</em>. Tier Zoo even remarks that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">If you're a herbivore player and you get beat by your prey</a>, you should probably choose a new main."
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterBunny">Easter Bunny</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EpicRapBattlesOfHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EpicRapBattlesOfHistory">Epic Rap Battles of History</a></em>. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHamAnnouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHamAnnouncer">The Announcer</a> can't get enthusiased about him, and the ensuing rap battle against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a> is hilariously one-sided with Genghis simply laughing off his first verse.
</li><li> Ben from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PuffinForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PuffinForest">Puffin Forest</a></em> tend to play a lot of these. Most of the time they end up exactly how you'd expect.
<ul><li> His most famous character is probably Abserd, a character with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">a level</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">in every class</a>. Because his level in each of those classes is so low, he can't really <em>do</em> anything. The justification for how this is possible is that his voice is so annoying that he keeps getting kicked out of every group he joins.
</li><li> Michele the Gnome Monk manages to buck the trend and become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a>. Ben's brother, Will, wanted a completely useless character that sucks at everything, so Ben gave him the worst character he had, a gnome monk. Michele ended up being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> of the party's clash with the villain Malikar and the one who came closest to beating him, and Will ended up playing him through <em>three separate campaigns</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Mystery_pitcher">mystery pitcher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or "joke pitcher" is a position player sent to the pitching mound, even when they have little to no training in throwing pitches. Sometimes (in extra innings) this is because the team's out of pitchers and has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot">make do</a>, but more often it's because the game is lost already and the manager doesn't want to waste a good pitcher's arm for a lost cause. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">And it's not unheard of for mystery pitchers to win</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SiIvaGunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SiIvaGunner">SiIvaGunner</a></em> King For a Day tournament, Ajit Pai was one, having only one promotional rip and dying to the hands of Thanos. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> in the sequel tournament, where he becomes ressurected as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> and is treated as a legitimate competitor.
