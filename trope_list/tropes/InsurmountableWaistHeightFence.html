</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The phenomenon, found in countless video games, in which a seemingly trivial obstacle — such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedDoor">Locked Door</a> — cannot be circumvented or removed with brute force, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatisticallySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatisticallySpeaking">no matter how powerful the player character(s) is/are</a>. This is more jarring when the obstacle in question does not mark the edge of the gameworld, but rather serves to force the player into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowThePlottedLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowThePlottedLine">taking a particular path</a>.
</p><p>The basic Insurmountable Waist Height Fence is an obstacle, usually between ankle and chest height, that should be reasonably easy for any able-bodied human to traverse, but the character(s) can't climb or step over simply because the game doesn't include such an action. Other common variations include:
</p><p></p><ul><li> The <em>Indestructible Adamantium Door</em>, a door that only can be opened in cutscenes or by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfUnlocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfUnlocking">Master of Unlocking</a>. Bonus points if it looks like it was made from cheap wood 200 years ago — or even worse, is already slightly ajar.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> The <em>Indestructible Fallen Log</em>, similar to the <em>Indestructible Adamantium Door</em>. A fallen tree which, despite your having nuclear weapons in your arsenal, can't even be chipped.
</li><li> The <em>Unclearable Debris</em>, a pile of rubble of some description that is apparently both solid enough you can't move any of it yet unstable enough that the game won't let you even consider climbing over it.
</li><li> The <em>Impassable Forest</em>, a sparse congregation of vegetation, apparently sporting a force field that expels player characters.
</li><li> The <em>Frictionless Hill</em>, a slope of arbitrary steepness onto which you can jump only to slide off as if the thing were coated in an industrial lubricant.
</li><li> The <em>Frictionless Ledge</em>, a particularly lazy method of boxing the player in by simply not allowing the character to jump up to and/or grab a ledge that they would normally be able to. Often results in the character making a poor attempt at climbing up it when, on the intended path, they'll throw all their energy into it. Is essentially the animation version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantReachIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantReachIt">I Can't Reach It</a> for climbing characters.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> The <em>Gentle Slope of Unclimbability</em>, a slightly inclined piece of land which, despite all logic to the contrary, is completely impassable, both up <em>and</em> down.
</li><li> The <em>Endless One Story Staircase</em>, where if you go up (or down) you can climb forever, either because you can't go that way or you missed getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupon</a> that allows you to, and so you could climb those stairs for ten minutes or for three days, but turn around and all you traveled from where you started was maybe a couple meters.
</li><li> The <em>Rough Ground of Unwalkability</em>, an area of rocky or otherwise uneven terrain you can't even step onto.
</li><li> The <em>Ledge of Instant Death</em>, a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityBarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityBarrier">Gravity Barrier</a>, that looks safe to jump down from, but kills you anyway. Especially flagrant when the game doesn't otherwise have falling damage.
</li><li> The <em>Knee Deep Water of Uncrossability</em>, a body of shallow water which may as well be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a> as far as your ability to ford it is concerned. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a>.
</li><li> The <em>Impassable Head High Hole</em>, an opening you can't enter because the top of your character's head is an inch too high. For whatever reason, your character can't/won't just crouch and move through it.
</li><li> The <em>Unslideable Passageway</em>, a passageway that needs to be crawled through but isn't at ground level. Thus, it's inaccessible because you can't crawl over a tiny obstacle or pull yourself up into a crawl.
</li><li> The <em>Impenetrable Darkness</em>, an area which is impassible because your character apparently has a paralyzing fear of the dark. Sometimes justified if there are actually things in the dark trying to kill you or pits to avoid, but more often leaves the player wondering why they couldn't just use one of a hundred different ways to create light.
</li><li> The <em>Overpowering Constant Wind</em>, which uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VentPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VentPhysics">Vent Physics</a> to push you out of an area if you try to enter it.
</li><li> The <em>Nagging Voice</em>, in which an NPC stops you from trying to go down another path or otherwise prevents you from deviating from the plot. Particularly annoying if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">your character is supposed to be at odds with this NPC</a>.
</li><li> The <em>Invulnerable Guard</em>, in which a common enemy or hostile NPC is guarding a door, pathway, etc. to prevent you from going down that path. It can get especially egregious if it's a common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mook</a> that you've defeated by the hundreds, yet the game won't give you the option of trying to shove/push/fight your way past them.
</li><li> The <em>Idiot's Dilemma</em>, a particularly infuriating form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a> — a puzzle requiring a "correct" solution thwarts the player's progress, in spite of a glaringly obvious alternative solution being available — for example, solving a complex puzzle lock to open a glass door when the player has a hammer in their inventory. Usually accompanied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantReachIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantReachIt">I Can't Reach It</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformingTheFourthWall">Informing the Fourth Wall</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGetYeFlask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGetYeFlask">You Can't Get Ye Flask</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">Invisible Wall</a></em>, because sometimes developers just don't care. There's not even a flimsy justification for why you can't go that way. You just can't.
</li></ul><p>Many examples could also be thought of as ordinary, non-insurmountable obstacles combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">Invisible Walls</a>. In fact, that is often how they are implemented in situations where the game can't just forbid the player from jumping, climbing, swimming or doing whatever it is a normal person would do to get by the blockage.
</p><p>A variant on this type of structure is called a <em>Sawtooth</em> by game designers; it applies to anywhere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">that stops the player going back after passing</a>, and is often logical to the point it's hard to notice (a ladder collapses after you climb down, an elevator is disabled by a powercut, etc). Particularly shallow sawteeth are likely to be obvious, jarring, and extremely ridiculous, such as a hallway that only works in one direction.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em>, Wander can climb mountain-high monsters and still be unable to scale a few mountains in the valley with relatively gentle slopes.
</li><li> With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>, when you encounter a certain unopenable door in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject">The Journeyman Project</a> 2: Buried in Time</em>, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">AI Sidekick</a> comments, "I've got a feeling that the room behind this door has neither been modeled nor rendered." Similarly, the original <em>Journeyman Project</em> makes you take the lift straight from your 4th floor apartment to the ground floor transporter booth that takes you to work. Pressing floors 2 or 3 receives a reply of "Access denied; this floor was never modeled nor rendered."
<ul><li> The games also double subvert this at times. There are many options that would either kill you or violate several time travel directives, and the game does allow you to pick them, but doing so is an instant game over. For instance, at the beginning of the game, if you choose to go to a vacation spot instead of your headquarters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">Have a Nice Death</a>, as you are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret-Gone</a> by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom">reality distortion wave.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures">Star Fox Adventures</a></em>: There is a certain room in a cave that requires you to pointlessly trek a longer path around the room even though the entrance and exit to the room are mere few feet away from each other, all because a small amount of short grass stands between them. This room, as well as every other similar room in the game, is used to allow the game time to load the next area.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original has "doors" which are no more than a few two-by-fours nailed together into a gate, barely as high as Lara's tall, and with plenty of room to be climbed over. Lara can't get past them without finding the switch to open them, even though she's strong enough to drag large crates and has a jumping ability to rival <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario</a>.
</li><li> In the 2015 reboot, Lara is incapable of surmounting any obstacle that isn't painted white. Grab onto a random ledge? Nope. Grab onto a random ledge with a smear of white paint? No problem. This will, of course, force the player to go the long way around even if there is a shorter, more obvious route if only Lara wasn't so fixated on only interacting with white painted objects.
</li><li> In one level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a>: Anniversary</em>, you come across several cages. With vertical and <em>horizontal</em> bars, which look like they could be climbed like a ladder. Which you nevertheless cannot climb, for a game which features all sorts of climbing (and actual ladders) in other situations... The series as a whole frequently uses frictionless hills, indestructible fallen logs/doors, uncrossable water/quicksand, and impassable foliage.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em>, early in the plot a locked door provides an obstacle, and a friendly nearby robot is willing to create explosives (out of chewing gum) to break it open. This ignores the fact that the main character is equipped with a missile launcher.
<ul><li> Although since <em>Cave Story</em> is a 2D game, it probably has something to do with the fact that the protagonist can't actually point his missile launcher at the door.
</li><li> Later in the game, the entrance to the waterways is initially blocked by a grate which can't be opened even with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPC</a>'s help.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 2D <em>Zelda</em> games provide many obvious examples of this, with a plethora of simple obstacles that nevertheless require you to find a powerup first. Move past a bush? Not without your sword. Step over a small rock? Forget it unless you got your power glove. A small tree? Nope, only if you got the fire wand. One of the most outlandish is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em>, where you can walk past trees in winter, but in any other month their <em>hanging leaves</em> form an impassable barrier. The newer games in the series tend to avert this to a greater degree; for example, starting from <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, bushes and pots can be destroyed from the start — using weapons or just bare hands. No Power Glove required.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em> actually avert this, in a subtle sense that most players won't catch. Very low fences, like the ones in the training area in Kokiri Forest, can be backflipped or side-jumped over. This is mostly used in speed runs to save quantum bits of time, and can easily be exploited to reach the Heart Piece above Dodongo's Cavern without using a Magic Bean. (Side-jumping off the tower in Kakariko Village can also allow Young Link to talk to the man on the roof and obtain another Piece of Heart early.) <em>Majora's Mask</em> made this much more difficult to pull off, due to changes to the backflipping physics (Link jumps higher, but covers a shorter distance). It's completely gone in the Gamecube and Wii games, where attempting to flip over similarly-high fences will cause Link to hit an invisible wall and more effectively prevent sequence breaking.
</li><li> The fences in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>'s Hyrule Field. While they come up to adult Link's waist, Link on Epona's back must jump over one in particular it as if it were a high fence, and only then at a very particular angle (perpendicular).

To get it down, Link has to go all the way to a dungeon on the other side of Hyrule/the island, defeat countless monsters, and get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes">Sprint Shoes</a> so he can ram the bookcase and the book will fall off.

<ul><li> Every time you try to sail to areas your map doesn't cover, the King of Red Lions (your boat) says something along the lines of "In that direction is sea too dangerous for you to travel now." and refuses to sail through.
</li><li> The King of Red Lions also does this if you try to go anywhere but the row of three map tiles between Windfall and Dragon Roost Island before finishing Dragon Roost Temple, and the column from Dragon Roost to the Forest Haven before you clear the Forbidden Woods, so if you want to get back to Windfall Island from the Forest Haven, you have to go north and then west, rather than just cutting through diagonally.

Running over one of these sends you plummeting to your doom, and a convenient passing knight has to save you. Link has his own rideable bird, but the game doesn't let you call it unless you jump off in one of a few special spots (which are not fenced). So even though he can, technically, jump over the fence, it might as well be an infinitely high wall that scolds you when you run into it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>' Legend Mode, the mission in the water temple tasks you with saving Ruto, who gets trapped inside a room in the middle of the temple. To get to her, you have to find flood gates to drain the water blocking the way to the room... except the water in this case seems to be only about chest-deep at most, so there's no reason you couldn't just wade or swim there. Becomes even worse after you open the first floodgate and most of the water is drained away, leaving two ankle-deep streams that you could easily jump over or wade through, but which are treated as insurmountable obstacles. This is particularly egregious when you're playing as Ruto, who somehow cannot swim through the water.

In its expansion pack "Opposing Force" the character of Adrian Shephard, despite being a trained marine, cannot breach doors unless he enlists the help of an NPC with a blowtorch. Even worse, the NPC must be kept alive during an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a>; if he's killed, the game ends. Shephard apparently can't just take the blowtorch from the fallen man and use it himself.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrothersInArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrothersInArms">Brothers in Arms</a></em> games feature highly physically fit paratroopers who are unable to surmount fences and earthen walls that seemingly only reach them to the waist. Curiously enough, during scripted attacks some enemies are capable of jumping over said fences.
<ul><li> In the second game Sergeant Matt Baker, an NPC who was the player character in the first game, can be seen climbing over one of those low fences that he could not traverse when he was controlled by the player.
</li><li> Finally, in the third game, Hell's Highway, vaulting over obstacles was implemented. There's also a lot of destructible cover and terrain. Nothing beats blowing an MG out of his nest with a bazooka. The only things you can't go through are buildings — pretty much everything else is vaultable.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> series, our hero does not normally have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a>, but some bodies of water, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em>, are "instant-death water of uncrossability". Even in the games that lack falling damage for normal falls, falling in the wrong place kills you, preventing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a>. There's also Frictionless Hills and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">Invisible Walls</a>, some of which are lethal. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorderPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorderPatrol">Border Patrol</a> in multiplayer maps.
</li><li> The <em>Indestructible Adamantium Door</em> variant shows up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowWarrior2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowWarrior2013">Shadow Warrior (2013)</a></em>. Made especially frustrating in that your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">badass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">sword</a> can destroy stone, demons' shields, cut up baddies like butter, and yet can't chop through a few flimsy boards across a doorway.
</li><li> The two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a></em> games not only made strides to avert this trope by making much of the environment destroyable, but also sometimes required brute-force breaching to progress with the game. This feature, however, caused those points in the game that were obstructed by indestructible architecture (i.e. most of the game) to become only that much more conspicuous.
<ul><li> Ironically, the third Red Faction game, with its enhanced ability to destroy anything waist-sized and up, and jetpacks and sprinting that allows the player to reach just about anywhere, there are several Ledges Of Instant Death and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">Invisible Walls</a>, usually at the bounds of the map. The player can find even greater heights to jump from without fatality, or even sometimes without major injury, and still die when jumping off map-edge ledges, while the little posts with bleeping lights on them tell you that the dastardly EDF have erected an invisible wall in the middle of this empty field.
</li><li> In the first game, there are several "ledges of instant death", where it looks like you can jump to them, but the landing kills you.
</li></ul></li><li> Notably avoided (somewhat) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> where the player, when faced with a wooden door can always just blow it open with explosives or knock it down with the energy sword. Only reinforced metal doors and some plot-important doors were completely impassable. Played straight in one scene where you are supposed to surrender to the enemy and cannot escape the spot where they engage you even though it is fenced with nothing but waist-high blocks.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> games are absolutely crazy about this. There are <em>knee high</em> fences you can't step past. And if there's some rubble, "this road's closed, we have to go the other way!". *sigh*
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em>, it doesn't matter if you're Force Recon, Army Rangers, or SAS; you lack the training to open doors. Though, once you transfer from any of those to Task Force 141, you get a bottomless supply of breaching charges to just blow the doors to smithereens.
</li><li> The infamous "Mile High Club" bonus mission could be completed in all of about 15 seconds if you could just climb the stairs placed right behind where you start if not for the fact there are two trunks just parked at the base, meaning you have to route all the way around through the rest of the plane (in one minute against a hail of gunfire on Veteran difficulty). The staircase isn't even off-limits, you can climb down it once you've completed the rest of the mission before you bail from the plane. The only thing preventing your highly-trained operative from saving the VIP with no fuss is a couple pieces of luggage.
</li><li> In 3, you can open a few doors. It's just that terrible things happen every time you do.
</li><li> In multiplayer, hosting a dedicated server lets you, among other variables, set jump height much higher than in normal gameplay. This doesn't really let you go anywhere you couldn't normally get to, as pretty much every prop in the game even half as tall as a player character has an invisible wall around the top.
</li><li> Some parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Black Ops</a></em> allow you to open doors, but other times you have to wait for your teammates to come by.
</li><li> More flagrantly, certain fences can only be traversed once you get the go-ahead and your team advances, such as at the beginning of the level "Hunted".
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Condemned</em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CondemnedCriminalOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CondemnedCriminalOrigins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a></em>, it's not uncommon for a tipped-over shelf to completely block a door, preventing Ethan Thomas from passing when he could have easily shoved it out of the way. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Condemned2Bloodshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Condemned2Bloodshot">sequel</a>, it's made even more frustrating in that Ethan can now climb through windows, slip through gaps, climb boxes, and jump down pits, but only when demanded by the very linear level design. It makes it very frustrating to be in a hotel and see a luggage cart and reception desk blocking your path, requiring you to find the small, foot-wide area where you can press the magic button to slip through. Of course, Ethan can never do this in other circumstances, such as climbing over a few cardboard boxes and a couch instead of needing to use a conveniently-placed ramp. The worst part is that oftentimes players will struggle to find a context-sensitive area that allows them to progress, or spend time searching for an alternate route when Ethan can just climb through the hole. He can't even climb fences or gates that are locked behind the people he's pursuing, yet attacking enemies can vault over them no problem.
</li><li> Also, Ethan lacks the ability to jump (again, unless it's part of the level design). The issue? Physics objects, like garbage cans, can easily fall in the player's path, yet Ethan can't jump over them and will be stopped in his tracks by an ankle-high cardboard box, requiring the player to kick it out of the way.
</li><li> The first game featured flimsy wooden doors that can be chopped to pieces with an axe but not a crowbar and chains and locks that can be broken with a crowbar and not an axe, and other strangely specific ways to get past obstacles in a game that emphasized improving weapons...
</li></ul></li><li> Integral to much of the level design in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomII">Doom II</a></em>, where any protrusion above knee height might as well be Mount Everest until you find the right button to lower it. A number of source ports have since added jumping to the game, which allows players to skip huge swaths of some of the classic levels by simply hopping over these obstacles.
<ul><li> Although you can jump in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em>, you are incapable of surmounting waist-height obstacles such as broken stairs.
</li><li> The fourth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">Doom</a></em> game subverts this entirely by adding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump">double jumping</a> and ledge catching to the player's repertoire...which you will need in order to navigate the game's many treacherous jump puzzles.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the Official Playstation Review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone2">Killzone 2</a></em>, there's a particularly bad example. The player's squadmates can climb over a fence with no problem, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> needs their help to get over <em>the exact same type of fence</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> mostly lets you use your super powers to do awesome things. However, after a while, one begins to notice that the entire island is made of valleys with walls just slightly too steep to climb and just slightly too high to jump over.
<ul><li> <em>Crysis Warhead</em> doesn't. While you can drive down trees with your Armoured Personnel Carrier and blow up whole buildings with nothing but a grenade, you will still get stuck (sometimes permanently) in the same flimsy wood fences that you could kick down even if you <em>weren't</em> a nano-suit augmented super soldier.
</li></ul></li><li> Since you can't jump in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> games, any object taller than ankle height is insurmountable, e.g. overturned furniture blocking a hallway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> and its sequel feature a variety of these. There are a number of occasions where the survivors' path is blocked by apparently surmountable obstacles: the truck on the bridge after it is bombed in "The Cemetery" level of <em>The Parish</em> campaign and the short fence before the running panic event in "The Barns" level of <em>Dark Carnival</em>, both in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em>, are outstanding examples. The survivors are also incapable of scaling drainpipes, columns and the like, despite the Infected (which are just humans with a mutant strain of rabies) being perfectly able to use them, and there are a large number of handle-less doors that are impervious to chainsaws, fireaxes, crowbars and explosions despite all of these objects being able to demolish and/or damage all the "usable" doors throughout the game. Also, when playing as the Infected in Versus mode, the limits of the player's range are often baldly indicated with a literal invisible wall, marked only with a string of floating "no entry" signs. The survivors' initial spawn point in a campaign is often surrounded by an invisible wall (as at the beginning of <em>The Parish</em>, where the players are prevented from running off the side of the dock or off the short gangplank leading up to the waterfront).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em> series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom">railroads the player</a> with just about every type; standard insurmountable waist-height fences or walls, barbed wire, minefields, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">invisible walls</a>, indestructible fallen logs, impassable foliage, unclearable debris, adamantium doors, and unclimbable slopes. Even the more non-linear <em>Airborne</em> often uses these, and no, you can't parachute over them either. One of the most egregious examples is the insurmountable brick wall in the first mission. One exception is the Sniper's Last Stand: Outskirts level of <em>Allied Assault</em>, where you get to blow open a gate with a bazooka. The Nebelwerfer Hunt has an impassible window where you have to trick a Tiger tank into destroying the wall, as you can't blow it up with your own rocket launcher either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters">TimeSplitters</a></em> has a few instances of this. In one level of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplittersFuturePerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplittersFuturePerfect">third game</a>, your path is blocked by a few strips of police tape and a hole in some boards. A little strange in that your partner Jo-Beth has no problems climbing under the tape. <em>Very</em> strange after she falls through the floor on the other side and instead of climbing under to check on her, you go a much longer path.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekEliteForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekEliteForce">Star Trek: Elite Force</a> II</em> has one of these moments, where the main character and his team are in a sewer system and he gets separated from them. Shortly thereafter, they find each other in the maze of tunnels only to be stopped from continuing on together by barrier resembling the bars on a jail cell. Only the bars are about two and a half feet or so apart. One team member even places a hand on each one and leans forward through the bars, only to say signs. The survivors' initial spawn point in a campaign is often surrounded by an invisible wall (as at the beginning of <em>The Parish</em>, where the players are prevented from running off the side of the dock or off the short gangplank leading up to the waterfront).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rage">Rage</a></em> includes a jump button, but places invisible walls in various locations to ensure that the player can't take the easy way out. Want to just vault over that wall and drop two feet onto the escalator down to the ground floor of the mall? Nope! Gotta go unlock the gate in front of it. Want to just crawl through the small hole in the fence that leads to the button? Nope! You can't go any lower than a crouch, so you need to blow a hole in the wall to enter the room.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> series uses the Impassable Head-high Hole and Invisible Wall in a number of places.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009">Wolfenstein</a></em> both use these to prevent the player from accessing areas until the plot requires it, such as unreachable ladders that may later automatically get lowered, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotLock">plot locked</a> doors, unclimbable ledges, and impassable barricades, which may be cleared by a higher power such as a tank.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostReconAdvancedWarfighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostReconAdvancedWarfighter">Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter</a></em>, most waist-height walls can be vaulted over, but some block your path for no good reason. In the mission where you have to recover the nuclear football, your immediate path to the objective is blocked by insurmountable wooden road barricades.
<ul><li> Do you think M1 Abrams tank is able to overcome ankle-high curbstone? Think again.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixVegas">Rainbow Six: Vegas</a></em> games suffer likewise.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain obstacles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em>, such as a broken stairway in the Medical Pavillion, can only be hopped over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore">once you've been to the other side a different way</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge">Mirror's Edge</a></em> involves a mission in which Faith must descend to near-street level to enter a subway system. Though falling into the street being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityBarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityBarrier">instant death</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">is feasible</a> if you're ten stories above it, it makes decidedly less sense when it's more like ten feet.
</li><li> One level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FEAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FEAR">Fear</a> 2: Project Origin</em> starts in an elevator stopped halfway between floors, and it looks like Becket should be able to climb out onto the upper floor, but the game physics don't allow him to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardReset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardReset">Hard Reset</a></em> features both insurmountable waist-high obstacles and impassable slightly-shorter-than-your-height gaps. You can't duck through an opening that's slightly below your head height because there is no crouching in the game. Almost as if to emphasize this, such openings are often present.
</li><li> A particulary colorful example is given in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying">Clive Barker's Undying</a></em>, where the protagonist, when confronted by an ancient monastery door, decide quite abruptly that the easiest way to deal with it is NOT to use the dynamite he's carrying at the moment, but rather to travel back to a time when the monastery was inhabited and get the key from the residents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em> contains two examples very close to each other in the main story, both of which are blatant attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity">draw out the endgame</a>. The first is a bridge which is raised to bar your progress, to which the main characters have to undertake a convoluted sidequest to bypass, despite there being a huge pipe crossing the expanse that could be climbed on (if the characters could climb anything other than a ladder.) The second is another pipe, this time with a ladder which falls off when you approach. You must undertake another pointless quest to burst the pipe and walk through it. The second example is worse, because you can <em>actually get on top of the pipe in another location,</em> but are stopped from walking to your destination.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast">Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</a></em>: At the end of the trial to test his newly regained Force powers, Kyle Katarn must retrive his lightsaber from a cage atop a pillar. Lowering the pillar is easy enough, but getting his saber out requires a carefully timed combination of Force Speed and Force Pull... even though the bars of the cage are far enough apart that Kyle could quite easily just reach in and grab it. Or levitate the lightsaber out between them. Or activate the saber remotely and cut the cage open.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000SpaceMarine">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a></em>: Captain Titus cannot jump, only roll, therefore knee-high obstacles are impassable to him. You do get a jetpack, but only in certain levels.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first game, the town of Tristram is delimited on all sides by these. A waist-high stone wall to the northeast, a river to the southeast that's maybe a metre wide and 30 cm deep. The western border is blocked by moderately large rocks (150 tall at most). At least in this case, your character has no particular reason to <em>want</em> to cross the barriers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> continues this — Act 1 of the game has sections separated by short stone walls and some trees and weeds between. Maybe there's poison ivy, and who wants to battle evil when they're itchy?
</li><li> Act two of Diablo II has a particularly weird and infuriating example: when you use the staff to blast a hole in the wall of Tal Rasha's tomb in order to get to the chamber of Tal Rasha (where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Duriel</a> turns out to be lurking)) you cant go back out to escape Duriel even though there is a <em>huge freakin hole in the wall</em>, which apparenly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">only works in one direction.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI">God of War</a></em> uses arbitrary indestructibility pretty egregiously, especially given how destructive Kratos is to things he's allowed to hit. One particularly obvious example comes in the first game, where Kratos is blocked by a metal gate with thin bars, that already has a great big hole ripped through the center by Ares' forces (you know, the one you beat up all game, often by being physically stronger than them). Rather than climb through the hole or rip a new one in the gate, you instead go through a convoluted process of creating a 4 foot stepping stone so you can reach a ladder on a nearby wall and bypass the gate. This stepping stone? Is the head of an enormous statue that you pushed over with no leverage beyond bracing yourself against a wall. Then there's the start of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII">second game</a>, where the strength of a god allows you to throw the <em>Colossus of Rhodes</em> halfway across the city by seizing it by the foot, but won't let you break down a wall.
</li><li> An odd example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RWBYGrimmEclipse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RWBYGrimmEclipse">RWBY: Grimm Eclipse</a>. While most fences in the game <em>appear</em> to be much larger than the characters, all the characters in <em>Grimm Eclipse</em> are inexplicably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale">smaller than flowers</a>, so if the characters were normal-sized the fences <em>would</em> be waist-high.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>: Whether you're playing as a Hero, a Villain, or anything in between, your character will not plow through hapless bystanders—even when using a power like Super Speed. Instead, your character will slow down to a halt just before colliding with a bystander, or brush past them. This is explainable for the heroically inclined as they wouldn't want to cause <em>more</em> havoc than they're trying to stop, but less so for the villainous. Either way, it can be quite the annoyance, especially with indoor missions where terrified denizens run about in a panic, getting in your team's way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in <em>Graal Classic</em>, when Kull's Castle blocked certain doors with impassable Bottles. Your character is even heard to remark "I can't go this way—there's a bottle in the way!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi">Mabinogi</a></em>, some areas are littered with waist-high—and even knee-high or ankle-high—insurmountable obstacles; mostly fences, bushes, and rocks. The truly odd thing is that some areas have very low bushes which are insurmountable, while other areas have much taller bushes that characters can walk right through. This may be partly intentional; as it presents an obstacle to bots using the game's auto-walk map system.
<ul><li> Fences are understandable. Fences that a paper airplane cannot go over, not so much. Especially since the best places to launch the airplanes are always blocked by fences.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarUniverse">Phantasy Star Universe</a></em> has waist high fences in lobby areas regularly. What makes them so evil? Unlike most insurmountable waist high fences, where there is a way around, or nothing on the other side of interest, these fences REALLY DO have content on the other side that you can't get to. SEGA unlocks content, which already exists and was installed with the game, over time, letting them profit on your monthly fees; so you pay money for a few months in the hopes they'll yank down that fence. It's just cruel.
<ul><li> In a less evil sense, there are the laser fences on the field. Which are about waist high, and often positioned in a way where, even if your characters forget how they were jumping around like lunatics during their photon arts, may still be easily bypassed by either climbing over the control panel used to open them, or in some cases, just stepping around it onto a slightly higher part of the staircase than you'd normally use.
</li></ul></li><li> Fences in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> are sometimes not even waist high and yet a character can not go over them. There are certain spots where a character with high enough agility can cross by climbing over. Other than those, though, you basically have to go around the long way in order to get where you want to go. And some of these fences seem to cross entire continents!
<ul><li> Impassable water appears as well. The several rivers that appear in the game are all impassable despite being a few feet wide and inches deep. And the PC is shown many times in the game to be capable of swimming, including in a couple of fairly large areas that are <em>underwater</em>, yet cannot cross these very small rivers. On the other side, the PC claims that every accident including falling into water causes him/her to drown, even with the Diving Apparatus on. And, luckily, monsters also can't cross such obstacles, but some can be shot over. Coupled with the mobs' lack of any sophisticated pathing mechanics, you can get them stuck on the other side of a rock that is perfectly possible to walk around and shoot them to death.
<ul><li> One of the most awkward examples is on the border between a "F2P" area and a "P2P" area. There's a large hill keeping you in the wilderness, and out of the eastern member area. Just a large hill. A small bug in one part of it even lets you walk up to the top, then you just stop. Invisible insurmountable fence?

The invisible walls can be particularly aggravating, as anything steeper than a very gentle slope seems to have one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> has one prominent example. On the Starfleet Academy map you are not able to access the waterfront which is only separated by literal waist-height fence. Under normal circumstances your character would even be able to jump over it. However, when the area was first released there was a bug that transported you on the other side of the fence and let you explore the area beyond it—including the Golden Gate Bridge and the normally inaccessible shuttlebay atop one of the Academy's buildings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreeOfSavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreeOfSavior">Tree of Savior</a></em>, compared to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Predecessor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em>, gives all characters the ability to jump ... quite a height, at that. Unfortunately, all the various flavors of this trope are liberally applied throughout the game world. It would be quite frustrating figuring out what is accessible and what isn't, were it not for the minimap showing which parts of a field are accessible to a player. Even then the ability to jump <em>between</em> accessible areas (such as off a cliff onto ground below) is bizarrely restricted, leaving it <em>more</em> of a surprise as to what you <em>can</em> access (such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoofHopping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoofHopping">rooftops of Klaipeda</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">ZOMG</a></em> features several Insurmountable Waist High Fences. The stairs out of the Train Station are chained off, forcing you to fight your way through the Sewers (which also serves as the game's tutorial). Of course, the doors out of the station are locked too, and jumping the gate would mean missing out getting the rings you need to get any farther than Barton Town. Though when you can't step over a 2 inch ledge in the Zen Gardens, you start to suspect something...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>'s environment is largely immune from the damaging attacks of player characters, and it has even become a selling point of some dungeons that there are vehicles which can destroy parts of the internal dungeon's defenses. The most straightforward application of this is usually in a major city where there is a door visible, but no means of which to enter, or out in the less populated areas, where there will be a visible portal, which leads to nowhere, or cannot be entered at all. In the latter case, its usually a sign of a possible future dungeon entrance. Players who circumvent these barriers through glitches could be equally punished or rewarded by the GMs (As some sections are clearly NOT meant for the player to get to, while others serve as more of an Easter Egg bonus).
<ul><li> This problem will also frequently occur with player pets. No matter how small a fence or ledge is, if the player has to jump to scale it, there's a good chance your pet won't be able to. This can cause them to either get stuck, requiring the player to dismiss and resummon them, or sometimes try to find an alternate route around the obstacle which can lead to unwanted (though often amusing) pulls. Even pets that can fly will do it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a> also has bizarre movement behavior related to PCs being either being able or not able to walk up gradients of differing slopes. While some slopes are always far too steep to ever be climbed by a PC, other slopes will either be passable or impassable simply based on whether or not the PC should be able to pass over that area, regardless of the fact that two terrains might have the exact same slope. In fact, there are passable terrains in the game that a significantly greater in slope than many impassable terrains.
</li><li> In Ironforge, the pit part of the forge is only blocked by an invisible barrier from the perimeter, but not pathway going over said pit.
</li><li> In an example of the "Ledge of Instant Death", there are several places where the game limits your ability to explore by killing you instantly if you fall below a certain point— regardless of whether you actually fell far enough to be killed, or had any Slow Fall effects, <em>or even fell at all!</em> The terrain beneath the airship at the end of the Halls of Reflection is an example of this type; travel far enough down the slope, and you will drop dead regardless of whether or not you actually fell.
</li><li> During development of <em>Cataclysm</em>. the developers admitted that a lot of the geometry in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> simply wasn't there, and they had to put unclimbable terrain in the way so players couldn't get there. With <em>Cataclysm</em>, players can now fly in the original world, so Blizzard had to completely avenge it from the ground up in such a way that the entire world was accessible via flight. However there are still unclimbable slopes if you are not riding a flying mount.
<ul><li> Of course, even with a flying mount, there are still a handful of invisible walls, like in the mountains north of the Plaguelands, which blocks players from flying in, and forces them to enter via the gate, because the whole area is classed as an Instance.
</li><li> Patch 5.1 added the <em>Ledge of Instant Death</em> variety in the version of Dalaran visited during the Landfall storyline. Unlike the main world Dalaran, which is stuck in the past in Northrend, this version is an instance, so if you jump off its ledge into surrounding water that <em>looks</em> safe to jump into (normally, landing in water negates falling damage), you die while falling, <em>in midair</em>.

</li><li> Modern era <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> games seem to zig-zag this trope, depending on the stage. Some stages, Sonic can walk under water with no problems whatsoever with the only problem being lack of air. Other stages, once he goes past knee-deep, he encounters the <em>Knee Deep Water of Uncrossibility</em> and Sonic cries out "NO!" as he loses a life. Unless he's going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater">fast enough</a>, in some cases.
<ul><li> The knee-deep water issue plagues most of the 3D games in the series. <em>Sonic '06</em> and <em>Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric</em> get the most flak for this; Sonic may simply fall over and die even though <em>his head is still above the water</em>.
</li><li> Handled strangely in <em>Generations</em>, due to the game's nature of pulling levels from different games in the series. The most egregious examples are Seaside Hill (console) and Emerald Coast (3DS); the levels feature two different kinds of water; one that acts as a bottomless pit, and one that allows Sonic to explore underwater. In the 3DS version, the two kinds of water look very different, but in the console version, they look almost exactly the same, leading to some bottomless pit psyches.

Starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDS">Mario Kart DS</a></em>, whenever tracks from these two games are brought back for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel">Retro Cups</a>, the barriers are made taller than the racers but are no longer impassible.
</li><li> Most racing games have the track walled in by insurmountable adamantium barriers; even the "plastic netting" is impenetrable. Sometimes, as in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TestDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TestDrive">Test Drive</a></em> games, there will be open intersections with cross traffic, but they are blocked to you by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">Invisible Walls</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo">Gran Turismo</a> IV</em> has particularly strong plastic fences. On the Grand Canyon rally course, part of the course travels along the very edge of a cliff with only a foot-tall plastic home depot orange netting keeping a runaway car (or Truck) from careening off the edge. Somehow this flimsy-looking fencing handles the task incredibly well, even so far as bringing a full size Dodge Ram truck doing well over freeway speed to a dead stop.

Because there is no jumping players are forced to go around it, necessitating crossing over to the far side of the zone just to go around the difference. This can result in passing dangerously close to several mobs where groups are required.

However, it becomes so narrow that you should be able to easily jump it or even <em>wade through it.</em> Instead, you have to go all the way north to Veo Lu Sluice and revive the flowers that provide the river with water.

The game has to mark places where the obstacles are <em>not</em> insurmountable with little glowing circles, because your ability to jump over something has little to do with its size. Played even more straight with land based enemies, who can't jump even at the marked places.

A small child accidentally leaves her stuffed animal in front of the door to the bridge of your sandship. This makes it completely impossible to enter the bridge until you find her and get her to move it. Even worse, the characters <em>immediately declare this to each other.</em>
</li><li> Even worse is the Tower of Babel. A large, tall, <em>completely hollow</em> tower that your characters have to ascend in their Gears, which, of course, are capable of <em>flight</em>... and yet they make the entire ascent <em>on foot</em>.

Still, you'd think somebody so concerned about modesty wouldn't have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">dressed like that</a> to begin with...

The game setting being an island means there aren't even any barriers marking the boundary of the game world, simply a never-ending ocean should you attempt to leave.

On the other hand, even an unmodified Acrobatics skill, in the upper ranges of what is normally attainable, enables the player to reach the roof tops in several of the cities, and from there the city walls and thus the outside of the city — which should have been kept inaccessible, since this reveals that outside world is only an empty, low-resolution copy of the proper game world, which one reaches by exiting through the gates. In the expansion pack <em>Shivering Isles</em> some of the guardians patrolling the landscape are stymied by a combination of ankle deep water — which they refused to cross — and a slope that was <em>just</em> too steep to be climbed at their normal walking speed, so that they ended up treading in place for minutes on end. Further, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">paintbrushes which are "dropped" remain hanging in air,</a> allowing the creation of "invisible stairways" of paintbrushes to reach places unattainable even with stacked buffs.

Usually (at least on PC) the borders <em>can</em> be disabled by messing with some game files, and usually there's a surprisingly decent amount of game world actually modeled/textured that you can walk on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nehrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nehrim">Nehrim</a></em> (a game based on total conversion of <em>Oblivion</em>), not only are the transparent walls quite prevalent, the authors were quite fond of using "Ledge of Instant Death", sometimes becoming a "Gentle Slope of Instant Death" of "Flat Path of Instant Death". (After the initial cave, as the only path transfers from ledge to ravine, you can turn right crossing through some knee-high bushes (without even jumping), walk towards the waterfall and die for no visible reason at all.)
</li></ul></li><li> Like their <em>Elder Scrolls</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda">Bethesda</a> sister-series, the Bethesda-era <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">New Vegas</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>) also have invisible borders surrounding the edges of the playable game area, which will simply block the player from progressing telling you "You cannot go this way". The post-apocalyptic settings also lend well to piles of rubble, dilapidated buildings, and damaged-but-still-locked doors to be plentiful in blocking progress.
</li><li> The literal insurmountable waist-high fence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em>. Early in the game, when you first get to Toad Town, you'll see a Star Piece on the other side of a fence. You can't get past it until you get Sushie 5 chapters later, even though you can jump higher than the fence itself.
<ul><li> In Goomba Village, Kammy taunts Mario, and drops a Yellow Block on the gate out. Even though Mario can easily jump higher than the nose-high fencing, he can't actually jump over. Same with the fence at the bottom of the cliff the Goomba house is built on: it, too, is blocked with a Yellow Block, and you can't jump the fence. But in both cases, this is a good thing, as if the game didn't force you to get the Hammer, you'd be stopped by later obstacles and unable to harm some of even the earliest enemies.
</li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe">Strong as They Need to Be</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a>, Mario will be unable to jump over obstacles unaided that he would have been more than capable of jumping over unaided in other games, and/or still not be able to do the same despite demonstrating the ability to jump significantly higher than said obstacle in cutscenes or in battle in the very same game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Your character can jump <em>down</em> ledges that appear to be only knee high, but not back <em>up</em> them. The bikes in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Hoenn</a> games make this problem even weirder, as you can ride your bike up a mudslide twice as tall as your character or bunnyhop up tiny footholds in a cliff face... but still can't go over these tiny ledges. This is something of a visual artifact — in the early Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles, graphics were relatively limited and the ledges were intended to be about as tall as the player avatar, but were visually compressed to simulate a top-down view. Later games, despite overall graphical improvements, kept the ledge models very close to their original ones, resulting in them seeming knee-high at best to the player.
</li><li> Another ridiculous example is in the Old Chateau and the Canalave Library in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum</a></em>, where you can't step over <em>books</em>.
</li><li> Certain games require the player to ride a special Pokémon in order to cross otherwise impassable areas. Some of these are logical obstacles, such as open water or snow deeper than a person is tall. Rough ground also shows up as such an obstacle, but typically ends up looking like perfectly even ground with small rocks scattered over it that the player can't even set foot on.
</li><li> One of the most notable examples is the small trees that occasionally stand in the middle of a path. They're thin, and usually appear to be between head high and waist high for the player character, but you still have to use Cut on them to get past. They finally get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justification</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Generation VI</a>, where they're traded out for thick thorny bushes that are more clearly around twice the player character's height and width. Since thorny bushes are, well, thorny, your only option for bypassing them without endangering your health is to use Cut or some equivalent.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokemon Sword And Shield</a> has added invisible walls to the series - if you go out to the sea around the Isle of Armor DLC area, eventually you will simply stop moving.

</li><li> There is also an NPC-block keeping Ark from progressing.

There are a lot of nifty flying animations in battle, and yet you still get the same variety of jumping and bridging puzzles that would be completely passable if you thought to fly outside of battle when it was useful, rather than when it just looked cool. <em>Eternal Wings</em> makes a flimsy justification, and <em>Origins</em> explains it better; the wings used to be powerful enough to fly around all the time, but they have atrophied greatly over the years. Trying to use them for anything more than a few seconds results in the wings giving out. There's a reason these people use flying boats to get around. Granted, this still doesn't excuse Kalas turning around in Moonguile Forest because a log is blocking his path.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em> notably averts this — audiences at GDC '08 actually laughed when they saw a character simply jump over a waist-high fence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII">Breath of Fire III</a></em> puts you on a diversion that seems like it takes up a third of the game, simply to get around one of these fences. Specifically, it forces you to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> go through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> that is the Desert of Death to get to the final dungeon because your party, who often hop down cliffs exponentially taller than them, can't hop down off a crate barely as tall as Garr</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> games, your path is often blocked by lines of pebbles.
<ul><li> It's played for laughs at one point with a trio of insurmountable waist-high <em>puppies</em>. Trying to walk through them simply triggers Issac to declare that he doesn't want to disturb their playing.
</li><li> Parodied in Altin Mines in the first game, where a monster <em>leaps up a cliff face</em> to get around a puddle of water.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata">Eternal Sonata</a></em> features some insurmountable sticks on the ground, especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Mt. Rock</a>. Oddly enough, standing behind one of these sticks will cause an enemy on the other side of the stick to be seemingly unable to see you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> has Insurmountable Dark Patches Of Sand keeping you from straying from the path connecting the two halves of the town of Maramba.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory2">Rune Factory 2</a></em> has particularly bad examples of these. The game blocks your way with fences that are waist high, are falling apart, are made out of cheap wood, and are <em>just wide enough to block your path.</em> What's worse, they are located in totally random areas. They're not on the border of some person's property. They are not separating town areas from monster infested areas. In some cases, they aren't even part of a wall. The only reason they're there is to block the main character's path.
</li><li> Mostly whenever you see a fence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evergrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evergrace">Evergrace</a></em>, it's to keep you from dying as the other side is either a puddle of water or a drop off a cliff. This in turn marks one of the few times you'll wish for this trope's existence, since falling off of anything means your doom. In the bonus dungeon, there are no fences, but there are a HECK of a lot of enemies with knockback. Which turns a simple challenging dungeon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> instantaneously. Later on, it gains floors which turn from invisible to visible and back, slowly, enemies can come onto them, and there's STILL no fences to save you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, while driving the Mako on story worlds, the <em>Gentle Slope of Unclimbability</em> is made the more obvious, since on non-story worlds you can make it climb almost any mountain no matter how steep, while on story worlds you are confined to narrow valleys with walls much gentler and you still come rolling down from them. One time, there is even a Insurmountable Waist Height Fence in the form of a big boulder, that should make it impossible to go further with the Mako, but with some good positioning you can jump over it, leading to a glitch.
<ul><li> On Feros there's a steep drop-off leading into a level, and a party member refers to it as a one-way drop. It's farther than a human is tall, so while the heavily armored Shepard on his/her own might not be able to get back up, what keeps party members from helping?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, when you're recruiting Tali on Haestrom, rubble blocks your way until you find nearby demolition charges; while it's as large as you, you've been shown performing athletic stunts before that should make simply climbing up a lot easier than fighting your way through all those geth. And naturally, you can't clear the blockage by shooting it, even with the nuke launcher.
<ul><li> On the other hand, apparently the Lazarus Project <em>finally</em> taught Shepard how to jump over waist-high obstacles. But, of course, only in places where you're supposed to do so.
</li></ul></li><li> Another example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> is the Omega 4 relay itself. The game clearly states that many ships had tried to venture beyond the relay and never returned, implying that you should still be able to use the relay, though it might be result in an instant death on the other side. The game will only allow you use the relay, a key plot point, once you have progressed far enough in the game to obtain the key to passing safely.
</li><li> Same in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, particularly some fences on the Citadel. And some invisible walls on the Multiplayer maps preventing you from jumping to your death... but enemies can use jet-packs to jump up from somewhere below.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SweetHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SweetHome">Sweet Home</a></em> takes this to ridiculous levels. Rope on the floor? You'll need Kazou's lighter to get by it. Shards of broken glass? Asuka's vacuum is the only way around that. Shallow ditch in the ground? You need a board to cross it. This is despite the fact that the characters are all capable of walking through rushing streams, thorny bushes, piles of still-moving bodies, and even raging infernos.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>, if you attempt to exit the first area of the game (which is the area around Alec's home), or try to go to Argilla Pass before you're supposed to, you will bump into an invisible wall and receive a message that reads, "There are ants at your feet. You might accidentally step on them, so please don't continue in that direction." <em>Ants.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge">Geneforge</a></em>: No matter how powerful your character gets, he is never able to break through/into relatively flimsy doors and cabinets.

If your build is invested in magic, an Unlock spell does it better for cheaper. But many map borders and bottlenecks are still formed of waist-high fences, knee-deep water, and ankle-high debris.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfMana">World of Mana</a></em>, it's sometimes rather difficult to tell the difference between regular backgrounds and impassable ones, so it occasionally looks like your progress is balked by <em>slightly gritty dirt</em>. Additionally, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em> you're blocked by an insurmountable <em>optical illusion</em> that you can't get around unless you talk to the right <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPC</a> and then use the Lumina element on said illusion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story</a></em>:
<ul><li> A good chunk of the game is spent collecting the magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> needed to get past the barriers blocking Peach's castle, completely ignoring the fact the barriers only block the bridge and not the very wide area on either side of it, and Starlow can both fly and carry both Mario and Luigi while she does so, something she does routinely in battles against Bowser to get the bros out of range of his fire breath.
</li><li> It also has a pretty widespread example in Bowser himself as a playable character; since he can't jump, half his adventuring has you try and figure out ways round very small ledges that Mario and Luigi themselves can simply jump right over.

When you approach a marshy area, the hero will say "It's impossible to go further," and won't budge. An NPC actually gives you boots specifically for crossing the marshes just before you set out, making this something of a head scratcher. It's never explained that the boots are <em>an equippable item</em>, and that they must be worn in the "Greaves" slot by one of your characters.

Many areas that a lot of players seem to think you need to be able to fly to reach, in reality, require nothing more than patience.

At best, these objects force you to take a longer route to get to someplace about two meters away, and at worst they block off paths completely.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims">The Sims</a></em>
<ul><li> Sims cannot pass between squares separated by walls or fences, which leads to the ridiculous experience of surrounding a Sim with an ankle-high white picket fence and watching him starve to death, unable to cross it. As a means of a "fix", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2">The Sims 2</a></em> includes higher-than-waist fences only.
</li><li> <em>Sims 2</em> sims cannot climb out of a pool without a ladder. They would sooner drown than simply climb up the ledge that's only inches above the water line.
</li><li> Sims are also unable to escape when surrounded by pink-flamingo lawn ornaments.
</li><li> The insurmountable objects (fences, bushes, plant, etc) even apply when the Sim is above them i.e. put a bush next to the bed while the sim is sleeping and they will be unable to get out of the bed when they wake up, even if the bed is taller than the unpassable object. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And since the Sims can't die in bed this leads to an endless loop of them trying and failing to get out of bed even after they should have starved to death</a>.
</li><li> Your Sim will find themself unable to reach a needed object because of very small items left on the floor. This leads to much confusion for the Sim and yelling while gesturing wildly at the plate that was left on the floor that is now blocking them from getting out of their kitchen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySims">MySims</a></em> has a number of areas blocked off by being boarded up, having a fallen log across the path, having a random pile of rocks in the way, or there being a metal door there. You start the game with an axe. You cannot use it to chop down the boards or chop up the logs; you have to wait until you get the crowbar and saw, respectively. You cannot climb over the rocks, or over the fence into the desert. You have to earn the pickaxe first. At one point, a door blocks a bridge with no rails on it. You <em>can</em> enter the water in most places where it exists, but you cannot pull yourself out of it onto the bridge. Looks like earning the blowtorch is the only way to go...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3">The Sims 3</a></em> somewhat fixes this, with Sims now being able to get out of pools without using a ladder, as well as having small ankle-high fences that Sims can cross, though waist-high fences remain insurmountable.

Surrounding his Sim's home with said fence, Firefighters are unable to reach the house when it catches on fire and are forced to stand around and watch it burn. Later, Child Services arrives to remove a child from the home. The Child Services agent is able to teleport into the home to remove the baby, but then is unable to leave because of the fence.
</li><li> In most if not all of the series, The Grim Reaper cannot cross water. This means that a player can keep their Sims alive by simply surrounding the house with a moat; any Sims on the property inside the moat is protected from Death itself. This method even still works if the moat has stairs on both the inner edge and the outer edge - Sims cannot die while they are in the property, and generally only leave briefly when going to work or school, when Death cannot get to them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval">The Sims Medieval</a></em> has insurmountable knee-height fences, as well as serious difficulty pathfinding around other Sims.

Gets even sillier when you realise that fortifications (usually found on top of said walls) work as these too while allowing dorfs to fire things from behind them (if the fortifications are sufficiently submerged in water or lava, swimming creatures can pass them). Flying creatures can still bypass them.
</li><li> They're not walls per se, but trees are strangely impassable obstacles. A dwarf can wind up starving to death if the only path to a place has a sapling in it that ticks over to "mature tree" while he's on the other side of it.

Your character can easily jump high enough to clear the gate, but you still can't get over them, and there's no way to access what's beyond them.

Any normal adult could easily drop down that height without injury. Rather than doing so, Snake opts to climb back to the top of the tower and fight a Hind-D while Otacon fixes up the elevator.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> game series the protagonists, even though they are either well trained members of the Raccoon City Police's special task-force S.T.A.R.S. and/or are able to perform insane stunts like jumping down stairs while fetching a gun in mid-air and shoot gas tanks to take out an entire team of evil grunts one-handed, are overstrained when facing old, battered wooden (read: adamantium) doors they don't have the right key for. This trope becomes especially comical if the player is circled by a pack of zombies who will tear him apart any second and his only escape route would be through an old rusty garden gate, but he'd rather stop any attempts of escaping saying to himself "It's locked. I don't have the right key to open it". Further, in numerous cut-scenes the protagonists find themselves in exactly the same situation, but will then suddenly remember their training back at the police academy and simply breach the door which leads to their escape route.
<ul><li> This gets even more ridiculous in the first Resident Evil game, where Jill Valentine, ex-Delta force and current S.T.A.R.S member, complete with pistols, machine guns, and even rocket launchers, is equipped with a lock-pick and has been dubbed "The Master of Unlocking", still cannot go through the very same wooden doors. It gets even more absurd when a cut-scene in the game which shows Jill trapped in a locked room after she takes a shotgun from an adjacent one, ie the "Jill Sandwich" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendingCeiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendingCeiling">Descending Ceiling</a> room. Despite having a shotgun, she can't use it to blow the lock off the door, and ends up being rescued by another S.T.A.R.S member who simply kicks the door open.
<ul><li> The novelization justified it by stating that the locks that needed a key were reinforced locks that made lockpicking useless (Jill even comments that she never saw that type of lock before).
</li></ul></li><li> Not to mention the doors that require <em>obscure objects</em> to open them. Why would the protagonists go searching for a blue jewel or a silver crest, when they can just kick the door down instead?
</li><li> After the second battle with the Grave Digger worm in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em>, a fallen piece of fencing conveniently allows you to climb over a previously insurmountable rock. Although the rock looks like she could have climbed over it without the aid of the fence.
</li><li> During the days right before Raccoon City gets nuked (seen especially in, but not limited to, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em>), the protagonist will be confronted with a passageway that is blocked by a crashed car that could be easily climbed over or through. Sometimes, the car is on fire, or there is a pile of crashed cars. But usually, it looks easily surmountable. This is sometimes viewed as silly when the protagonist has to choose between climbing over the car into an empty alley, or fighting and dodging down a long road packed with monsters, and must choose the monsters because the car is insurmountable.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remake">Remake</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>, if you go into the room where you found the first floor map (and used your first self-defense item), you may find that zombie you killed earlier, now mutated into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">highly aggressive and physically powerful Crimson Head</a>, blocked by the three-foot high dresser you have to push out of the way to go down the hall where you killed it the first time.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil7Biohazard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil7Biohazard">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</a></em> and the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> feature an electrical switchbox sealed up with strips of strong, thick tape. The ends of the tape are plainly visible and accessible by hand, but your character will not even consider trying to peel off the stuff, and needs to find a knife to cut through it instead.
</li><li> The remake of <em>Resident Evil 2</em> also has a weapons storage room in the police station whose keypad is missing key caps for "2" and "3". Despite the fact that in real life you can easily still press the switches on the base of the keypad to trigger it despite the missing key caps, the protagonists don't bother and would rather look for the spare key caps just so they can press the buttons the proper way.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em>, especially in any scenes involving ruins or recently-destroyed buildings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em> hits this one early on. In most outdoor areas, you're navigating a map to try to get from point A to point B, but many of the roads are blocked, either by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pits</a> or insurmountable roadblocks. At one point in the second game, you're stopped by police caution tape. Yes, your character cannot get past police caution tape. Oddly, he is able to climb through a broken gate at one point.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em>, the above-ground path to the boat launch is blocked by a literal waist-height fence. To get around it, you must go through... the Abyss. And there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedDoor">Locked Door</a> barring entrance to that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillShatteredMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillShatteredMemories">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a></em> has one truly bizarre example is when you stop at the ranger station in the woods. It shouldn't take less than 8 seconds to get out of the car, but in the time it took for you to pull up to the cabin and get out, a waist-high snowbank has formed over the back part of your car and in front of you, blocking you from driving either direction. Strangely, the snowbanks tend to be high, but formed in a way that Harry could scale them with a little climbing.
</li><li> One of the many criticisms that players have for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour">Silent Hill: Downpour</a></em> is the fact that at the beginning of the game, the main character has one of his paths blocked by a fallen tree. Rather than, I don't know, actually CLIMBING over the tree that appears no more than a foot high, the character just gives up right there and decides to go the opposite direction where the haunted town lies.
</li><li> Downpour later justifies it when you are tasked with finding a key to start a boat. Murphy declares he can hotwire it no problem, and Bobby Ricks <em>immediately</em> tells him no, that they have to play by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">the town's rules</a>, and that they'll be punished if they don't. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Needless to say, the town <em>very</em> quickly proves Bobby right.</span>
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">Yahtzee Croshaw</a> pointed out, there's another bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em> where the character "runs around gathering a lighter, a wax doll, and a horseshoe to make a new handle for a trapdoor, all the while obliviously lumping around at least fifteen extremely cumbersome ways you could have pried it open."
</li><li> This taken to the point of potential parody in yet another puzzle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em> where you need to solve four puzzles to remove four locks from a box, only to find that it contains a few strands of <em>hair</em>. Said hair is used as string for a hook to fish a plot-important item out of a drain. Not only does the building your in contain <em>tons</em> of things that would serve this purpose, but James' <em>own hair</em> is long enough to serve said purpose.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kuon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kuon">Kuon</a></em>, there are various times when <em>objects</em> block your path including a small wooden disk, a fallen paper door, and what appears to be a jacket.
</li><li> Almost every level in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a></em> games (at least, the first two). Most of the exterior levels are bordered by flimsy barbwire fences. You can jump over higher things during the game, including climbing a stack of crates over a concrete wall (twice in quick succession) during one of the plot missions in Clear Sky, but the border fences are unjumpable. They do jingle when you bump them, though...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">Video Game</a>/Siren</em> female characters are unable to climb ledges above their hips in terms of height, while males can climb ledges that are just above their height in length. When a mission has a male character and a female one the player controls the male every time and in these ledges the player has to help the female get up the otherwise un-climbable ledge. If the mission is a single female the player has to find an alternate route or method to get to the same destination.

<ul><li> The insurmountable waist-high fences (and sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieChairDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieChairDie">other obstacles</a>) felt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader">Crusader</a></em> games, where you were an unstoppable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> and had guns that could blow up most of the scenery, but would at most deform metal fences, and not enough for you to climb over them. (In the games' defense, you couldn't jump for shit.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em>: Grate blocking subway ramp? You can't use grenades on it, only C4 will take it down, from the other side. Hedge maze in Washington Park? No, you can't climb over the hedges. Cars blocking the road?

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/S4League" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/S4League">S4 League</a></em> is a rather odd example. While camera glitches that allow shooting from directly behind walls are the most notable "features" of the game, two map-related glitches in the game are in the Colosseum map; if you Anchor (call it a surfboard with a grappling hook) or Fly (using wings) to a certain spot above your spawn point, there's a metal rod that resembles an antenna with clearly enough spacee between it and the building to shoot or snipe through. However, the game treats this space as a wall for some reason.
<ul><li> Similarly, if you anchor or fly across the space behind the spawn point and land on the other side, there's an invisible wall which you can't move through but oddly enough, you can shoot through it.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> game, you cannot step off of the tram platform onto the tracks and try to get around that way.

</li><li> It would be easier to list which examples <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">Uncharted</a></em> <em>doesn't</em> use <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4cuo9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4cuo9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4cuo9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Specifically, <em>Endless One Story Staircase</em>, <em>Impenetrable Darkness</em> and <em>Invisible Wall</em></span>. Sometimes these barriers are lifted after specific story events or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickTimeEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickTimeEvents">Quick Time Events</a>, but more often than not they remain there to keep the levels linear. <em>Unclearable Debris</em> and <em>Adamantium Door</em> are both the most common and most egregious due to the millennia-old and/or ruined environments Nate often explores and his general ability to climb up just about anything. <em>Knee Deep Water of Uncrossability</em> also combines with <em>Ledge of Instant Death</em> to give open bodies of water that look like Nate should be able to land in safely and swim as normal, only for him to die as soon as he hits it (especially weird when Nate uses this as an escape method multiple times in the story). <em>Impassable Forest</em> and <em>Gentle Slope of Unclimbability</em> are present in jungle and desert environments, respectively.
<ul><li> Happily, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">Invisible Walls</a></em> are never used, as environmental obstacles are favored in every situation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, with its redefined control scheme, makes it easy to just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands">hit the Action button</a> to jump over any sufficiently low fence when prompted. Of course, this only serves to make the game's proper insurmountable waist height fences more jarring when you have to perform an irritating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a> for a gate key instead of just jumping over the gate. On the plus side, a lot of non-plot-critical locked doors can be kicked down or blown open with a weapon, so it's a small step in the right direction.
<dl><dd><ul><li> Even worse was the 'Separate Ways' bonus chapters present in the PS2 and subsequent versions of the game, in which you get to play as Ada Wong. The girl with the Zelda-style hookshot that can attach to anything, even hundreds of yards away.

<ul><li> There's the scene where you have to wander around on a moving conveyor belt leading to an incinerator and littered with half-dead zombies, in order to get round a metal crate <em>that barely comes up to shoulder height</em> on the protagonist, who is strong enough to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">move a boulder several times his size by punching it</span>, but apparently can't lift his own body weight a few feet. To make it worse, the only thing preventing the heroes from going around the box is a <em>handrail.</em>
</li><li> In that same area, rails that aren't even ankle-high stop you from jumping off of a conveyor belt even though you did a knee-high jump to get on it in the first place &amp; will do another one to get off.
</li><li> Like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, the plot decides what waist-height objects you can and can't climb on.

The metal detector only takes up half of the hallway's width, with the other part being impeded by a desk. The <em>exact same model</em> as the desks you've been easily vaulting over at will since the beginning of the game. But <em>this</em> desk? Oh, no no no. It's too much of an obstacle.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> have instances of this as well. In GTA V there is a notable example: there is a construction site in downtown Los Santos (the site of the <em>giant</em> crane you need to climb to access a collectable item) where there are two concrete barricades: one red, one grey. The grey one can be jumped over. The red one is <em>virtually identical except for its color</em>, yet the player cannot jump over it in any fashion.
</li></ul></li><li> It's not waist-high, but the rubble/debris piles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> are arranged in such a way that any normal person could climb over them. The player character cannot, however.
<ul><li> There's another insurmountable waist high fence in a backyard in Takoma Park.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has some examples of this; the overworld is cut into cells to ease loading times, and one can only transit between cells at passes. A few of these passes also house <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">beef gates</a> to force the player to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowThePlottedLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowThePlottedLine">Follow the Plotted Line</a>. In particularly buggy areas such as the area around Nelson, the player character can end up several dozen feet off the ground by skimming a cell edge. Some of the indoor areas, e.g. Vault 34's main floor, are also divided into sub-areas.
<ul><li> There is a notable case of this in Freeside: the first cell extends out into the second one but only going through the doors takes you to the actual cell. The Cerulean Robotics factory is in about the same area as the gate to the strip and the Ruined Store is around where the Atomic Wrangler is supposed to be.
</li></ul></li><li> The earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> games play the trope much more directly. Because of how the game deals with shop inventories many of the merchants in the game have their items stashed in containers on the map just beyond the player's vision and, thanks to various waist-high obstacles, beyond their reach as well. At least one of these inventories in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> can be accessed with patient skirting of a waist-high fence, not that it really breaks the game at all.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, you may have superhuman strength or be packing enough explosive firepower to personally re-enact the Great War, but you aren't getting through an intact chain link fence. Nor will maxed out Strength and Agility enable you to climb it. Boarded-up doors are equally unpassable. Notably, one house in Natick Banks has an attic level with a loot crate, but unless you have a jetpack, you can't reach it because of an Impassable Head High Beam blocking the stairs.
<ul><li> Particularly egregious are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium">indestructible</a> Port-A-Diner claw machines, which have a ridiculous 1/50 chance of dispensing their delicious pie... at 10 luck. For the unluckiest, the odds are as slim as <strong>1/1000</strong>. All that stands between the player and its delicious pie is a bubble of transparent, glassy material so strong as to survive a nuclear war, as well as any and all ordnance the player launches at it, up to <em>point-blank mini-nukes</em>. It's honestly more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableJokeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableJokeGame">Unwinnable Joke Game</a> than anything else.
</li></ul></li><li> While the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em> is fairly open to the player, 'homies' can't climb, meaning that they can't get past an insurmountable knee- high fence.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> is no different. You can jump up onto ledges, jump across gaps, but your homies can't physically do it themselves, so they need the game AI to teleport them across to where you are.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> justifies this, along with everything else, with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">The Animus Did It</a>." The player is not exploring a real place, but a virtual re-construction of a place retrieved from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">Genetic Memories</a>. Areas of the map are blocked by virtual barriers which render them inaccessible until certain events have transpired: the player character is expressly trying to re-experience his ancestor's memories, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> results in "desynchronization" from the original sequence of events. Doors that the ancestor <em>never</em> opened <em>cannot</em> be opened. Barriers that the ancestor <em>never</em> surmounted <em>cannot</em> be surmounted. Targets can only be assassinated during specific events in which they are in the open because that is when the given Assassin found the opportunity to bypass security to make the kill. Guild branches always have open rooftop entrances because that is the method by which the Assassins always accessed them. Even in the countryside areas, geography keeps the players from wandering off the map; Ezio, a master acrobat who can climb sheer buildings hundreds of feet high, can't jump to the top of a three-feet high gentle slope, simply because he never really explored those areas and passes on no memories of what those areas contain outside of a specific path.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS">inFAMOUS</a></em>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2009/5/27/">Cole McGrath is an electric urban GOD.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Chainlink fences are his kryptonite. Seriously, he can climb anything, glide and ride rails and wires using electricity, but he can't climb a chain link fence? He's also stopped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">water</a>, but that makes more sense since he's electric, and the water grounds him out completely.
<ul><li> The sequel, however, fixed this, even offering an achievement/trophy for climbing on one of said fences.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> has plenty of these. Firstly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">the main character can't swim</a>, or indeed walk in it if it's above waist height. Then our main character has a pitiful jump which can often lead to your plainly attempting to get over a something if John doesn't automatically climb over it. This becomes very clear when the game bars you from areas of the map by placing them behind a river but it still has bridges across, the only thing keeping John out are a couple of small wooden barriers with plenty of room to the side so you could just walk around them. Then the game is littered with slopes that just a bit too steep to climb up which circles the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandBox">Sand Box</a> world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TonyHawksProSkater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TonyHawksProSkater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a></em> series does this frequently, with the New York level in Tony Hawks 2 being possibly the worst example of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs">Watch_Dogs</a></em> does this with its 'puzzles'.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a> contains a literal example. Fences appear small enough to jump over, but their hitbox is actually one and a half blocks high, making it impossible.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> games, the protagonists are strong enough to throw cars at helicopters and rip the turrets off of tanks. But the doors on military bases are made of tougher stuff yet, and you can't get through them without killing the base commander for his ID.

In the movies and various other media, these have been used to cut through several-inch-thick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">Unobtainium-steel</a> doors. In the games, they typically have no effect on any barriers whatsoever. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a></em> actually allowed you to bash open doors with your lightsaber, but there were still "magnetically sealed" doors that resisted all force.
<ul><li> Forget lightsabers; in the Expanded Universe just about every force user can hurl massive objects with a flick of the wrist and should easily be able to pull down nearly any barrier. Especially noticeable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em>, when the protagonist is able to pull a Star Destroyer out of orbit and throw five story <em>Unobtainium</em> doors around with the Force, but many other barriers are completely impassible.

<ul><li> Similarly, horses and other large animals are sometimes kept in non-electric, unbarbed fence enclosures; they could knock down a fence section without even trying... so, naturally, they only ever break fences by mistake, because <em>trying</em> to knock a fence down doesn't occur to them. Typically these fences are electrified when putting animals in a new pen. Once the animal learns where the fence is, they generally avoid the fence.
<ul><li> Domestic dogs generally won't even try to cross a fence that is waist high for a human, UNLESS they see another person/animal do it. Once they realize it's possible, they can and will climb and jump fences. Otherwise they will just go up on their hind legs and put their paws on top (if big enough) but won't even bother trying to cross.

</li><li> Many insects get trapped behind the window even if some of the window squares are open, trying desperately to fly against the glass. Of course this is due to their inability to see the difference between air and transparent glass.
<ul><li> Insects also tend to move up when they can't move horizontally, to the extent that an upside-down, uncovered cup will usually keep them trapped for quite a while until they fall out by mistake.
</li></ul></li><li> Birds can have the same inability as insects to escape a room though an open door or window, even when the openness of the door or window is <em>demonstrated</em> to them.
</li><li> Guineafowl have demonstrated a remarkable inability to get around an <em>open</em> farm-gate. Sometimes it takes as long as 15 minutes for them to realise they can <em>fly over it</em>, so actually managing to walk around it doesn't tend to occur.
<ul><li> Gavin Maxwell relates a tale of having opened the gate to let his geese out of their pen some time earlier than the time he regularly did it, then went away and thought no more of it. Then, some time <em>after</em> the regular gate-opening time, he looked out the window and was surprised to see no geese outside. He investigated, and found all the geese still inside their pen, pacing up and down impatiently in front of the open gate. Only after he closed the gate again and then reopened it with a theatrical flourish did the geese come out.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a> wrote about his dogs who waited in front of a door to be let outside, even though the door was the only part of the porch that was still standing after a hurricane. Thus, they could have simply walked <em>around</em> the door.
<ul><li> There was a video that appeared on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasFunniestHomeVideos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasFunniestHomeVideos">America's Funniest Home Videos</a></em> where the glass in a door was completely gone, for whatever reason. A golden retriever was sitting patiently at the door, waiting to go out. His owner stepped <em>through</em> the door, opened it, and <em>then</em> the dog went out. Same story when the dog wanted to get back in: the owner would step through the door and open it, and only then would the dog go.
</li><li> A similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic gif</a> shows a dog anxiously waiting in front of an empty sliding-glass-door frame; the dog doesn't attempt to run outside until the owner mimes opening the nonexistent door.
</li></ul></li><li> Pronghorn antelopes are apparently unable or unwilling to jump over even short fences (quite different from deer or true antelopes)
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>. The gas and oil pipelines laid across the northen Russian plains became a serious problem for the migrating deer herds there. Although the animals should technically be able to get over them, they are too afraid of an unfamilliar obstacle.
</li></ul></li><li> Some <a class="urllink" href="http://www.whatsthatbug.com/2003/04/25/little-red-bugs/">Running Mites<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> will not cross a drawn line. Draw a circle around them and they will helplessly run frantically around the circle.
</li><li> Road markings are this to self-driving cars, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">which can be</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/self-driving-car-trap.jpg">abused<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> Cattle, as well as horses, sheep and pigs refuse to walk over a grid or similar. You can put a road or driveway through a fence and keep your cattle in by putting a grid down. Hell, you could just <em>paint a grid</em> on the ground and they'd stay away.
<ul><li> That's because most cattle grids are made wide enough that the animal's leg could slip through the gap, potentially crippling it, and they can't watch where they put their feet like humans do. It doesn't look like much, but a cattle grid is a very real barrier to its intended target.
</li><li> Not just grids, but any wide enough gap, at least to <a class="urllink" href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10153751915401223&amp;id=739911222">this horse<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who refuses to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">board a subway train</a> until someone covers the gap with a plank.
</li></ul></li><li> To an office chair, a guitar cable is one of these.
<ul><li> Or a fold in the carpet.
</li></ul></li><li> Wheelchair users can often be stopped cold by something a person on foot might not even notice. Even places that were designed to be accessible might not have been maintained, while power wheelchairs have gotten bigger and all types have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWheelChair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWheelChair">gotten more varied</a> since the first accessibility standards were written in the 1970s.
</li><li> Related, some people with visual problems may either mistake an object that they can easily step over as being much bigger than it really is.
</li><li> Barbed wire and electrified fences. You could probably climb over them but would you really want to?
</li><li> It's not uncommon to find gaps in fences that a skinny kid can squeeze through but someone heavier can't.
</li><li> Very large ungulates like elephants and rhinos are kept in zoos behind a literal Insurmountable Waist Height Fence (or even lower). It helps show the animal better, and they are too heavy to jump or walk over the fence without touching it. The trick, of course is making the fence electrified to keep them from toppling it.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">only one</a> fence separating passengers by class in the <em>Titanic</em> was a waist height fence that became insurmountable because of stewards who didn't know that the ship was sinking. Of course this makes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">rather poor drama</a>, hence why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron">James Cameron</a> substitued them for several two meter tall fences in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">1997 movie.</a>
</li><li> In some jurisdictions, for example in Germany, it is not illegal to enter private property with no fence or similar around it. So while not stopping you physically, a waist height fence prevents you from entering legally.
</li><li> This is actually programmed into some animals. When placed on a table and a pane of transparent material (like plexiglass) extends off the edge and a treat placed on the plexiglass, some animals will be fooled that they cannot "walk off" the table to get the treat because there is a "drop".

In most versions, this rule is absolute — if your security clearance is ORANGE, then you will be shot on the spot if you walk into an area painted YELLOW. This is true even if the the YELLOW zone is only a meter-wide stripe on the floor of an otherwise ORANGE corridor.
</li><li> Wargames, both miniature and board, usually have some classes of terrain that is classified as 'impassable' to all or some kinds of troops- for instance cavalry in woods. While, yes the men could dismount and lead the horses through, in reality they didn't and the men wouldn't train for it; its not easy getting 600 men to the correct point of a wood in the middle of battle, in the correct place in their line and form up, and giving such a command would have a real-life subordinate quite possibly trying to find a way not to do something so suicidal. Where something out of the ordinary did happen it is usually dealt with by scenario specific rules.
<ul><li> Players will often enforce waist-high fences on their own - why yes, you could move a column of tanks into the town to attack the enemy there, but you never consider it because it is a good way to lose tanks.
