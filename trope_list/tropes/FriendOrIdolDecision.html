<ul><li> A Burger King's viral marketing scheme tried to be a parody of this concept. With the "Whopper Sacrifice" Facebook app, you can get a free Whopper. The real cost? You must un-friend 10 people. As most could probably expect though, all this resulted in were thousands more free Whoppers given away than expected, since just about everyone has some pruning they could do on their friends list - and, for that matter, had nothing stopping them from refriending once they got the friggin' burger.

The stipulations were that if Wicked or Mantis were pinned, they would have to give up their masks, if Ares got pinned he had to give up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Eye of Tyr</a>, and if Donst was pinned he had to lose his hair.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0enep');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0enep" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0enep');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While these kinds of matches are usually mask(s) vs. hair, Ares is bald, and the Eye of Tyr was far more important than any hair.</span> Realizing that his team was on the verge of losing, Donst bailed with his <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/pa/e/chikara/chikara-yl.html">CHIKARA Young Lions Cup<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, doing nothing to prevent Mantis from driving Ares through a chair and pinning him.
</li><li> Valkyrie revealed itself by jumping and mercilessly beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KiaStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KiaStevens">Amazing Kong</a>, laying out members of the SHINE roster who, somewhat unexpectedly, tried to stop them.

<ul><li> The classic example of this trope in literature is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBernardShaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBernardShaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>'s 1906 play <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheDoctorsDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheDoctorsDilemma">The Doctor's Dilemma</a></em>, in which a doctor must choose whether a phial of a new life-saving drug is given to a kindly poor colleague or to a brilliant yet thoroughly unpleasant artist.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesFromTheBorderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesFromTheBorderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a></em> is rife with these, but only when you're playing as Rhys.
<ul><li> An interesting subversion, where at the end of episode 2, you must make Rhys choose who to trust to save your friends Vaughn and Sasha who are being held at gunpoint: Fiona, who has a plan that's mostly just winging it, or the psychopathic Handsome Jack, who has a definite plan, but will lead to him gaining dangerous control of your body.
</li><li> Episode 4 ends with the choice and ramifications of a deal that Jack offers Rhys: he offers to get out of Rhys' head to become part of the Helios system and make Rhys the CEO, which has been his dream since he was a kid, or to reject the deal to stay with his friends. Whether or not you accept it can lead to the episode ending in very different ways.
</li></ul></li><li> In a somewhat gruesome example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal">Twisted Metal</a>: Black</em>, Dollface is offered the key to her mask, but taking it will close her former boss (who put the damn thing on her in the first place) in an Iron Maiden. She takes it, then decides that she didn't really want it anyway.
<ul><li> Needles "Sweet Tooth" Kane is given a cure for his curse (an eternally burning skull), but is told it will only work as long as he never kills again. He decides he likes killing too much, and decapitates Calypso, deciding to just live with the constant agony.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> series, you can choose: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">become a god, or stay mortal</span>. This choice is particularly poignant if you have a romance going at the time. (Interestingly, one of your possible romantic partners actually tries to convince you to take <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> godhood</span> when it's offered.)
<ul><li> The funny thing is, for this certain partner, actually doing as she asks you to do will give her the happier ending than staying with her.

The choice is the player's, but the next game in the series naturally assumes the Avatar made the Friend choice.
</li><li> In the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a>: Double Agent</em>, Sam (having infiltrated a terrorist group as one of their members) is given the choice of either shooting his NSA boss (a series regular, who's been captured by the terrorists) to maintain his cover, or shooting the terrorist standing guard over them (which instantly blows his cover and causes everyone in the base to come and try to kill him).
</li><li> Pops up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>. At one point, an NPC thief and a moogle are left hanging over a ledge, and the group can choose to save one. Saving the thief nets them a Golden Hairpin, a rare, but by no means unique, relic that halves MP consumption when equipped. This causes the moogle to plummet to his (apparent) doom. Saving the moogle nets the party Mog, an optional party member with fairly useful abilities and arguably the best character-specific relic in the game, which eliminates random encounters. He <em>can</em> be recruited later in the game regardless of choice, but choosing the Gold Hairpin will make Mog unable to learn his Water Rondo dance. (The remake for the Game Boy Advance allows the possibility for Mog to learn the dance after the critical point, but the encounter is one-time, and if Mog is not present for it, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a>.)

Ratchet sees this as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>, citing that if he leaves, Tachyon would use the Dimensionator to finish off the Lombaxes in a genocide attack anyway. And as long as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Tachyon</a> holds it and continues to summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">Cragmites</a>, <em>reality itself</em> is in danger.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunky">Spelunky</a></em> has this in the endgame areas: When a level is generated with the "I hear prayers to Kali!" feeling, the player will be presented with a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">damsel and a solid-gold Idol suspended over a pit filled with traps and a lava pool at the bottom.</span> Of course, canny players can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">rescue both</a>.
<ul><li> Only one of them actually triggers it anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope seems to be the only thing that can make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Shirou</a> give up on his dream of being a superhero. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, not just any friend.

<ul><li> A straighter example is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kotomine</span> offering Saber the Grail... if she kills Shirou, who is already near death.
