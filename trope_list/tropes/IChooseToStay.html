It wasn't totally impossible to communicate with home either or arrange for visits from there. In subsequent books more Earth people visit the World (either as contract workers or by accident) and some of them stay. Jerry stays on long term contract, so Wiz has some free time and because he is a better teacher than Wiz (though not so good as Karl). Danny found his love too. Mick is torn between his obligations as an Air Force pilot and love to a dragon rider woman; he doesn't stay, and the next opportunity appears only years later.

This was a temporary thing so Soon-Lee (<em>Star Trek</em> alum Rosalind Chao) could find her family, if they were even still alive. In the sequel they found them living in, no surprise, deplorable conditions, helped them out a bit, and when they came to the US, sent money back and tried to arrange for immigration status. The shock came not from Klinger moving to Korea for good. It came from him not bolting back to Toledo the instant the war ended.
</li><li> In "The Late Captain Pierce", Hawkeye gets an opportunity to leave when the Army declares him officially dead. He nearly does so, but at the last minute changes his mind. (Although, to be fair, this is depicted as owing to Hawkeye's sense of duty as a physician rather than any newly-discovered affection for his surroundings.) And the fact that the army would have charged him with desertion, once they got their paperwork straightened out, had nothing to do with it.

<ul><li> As described in <em>An Anthropologist On Mars</em>, a painter received a concussion from a car accident. Afterwards, he was unable to see in colors, and couldn't read written words. Though he recovered his ability to read, he remained completely colorblind. Not only that, but he was unable to remember color; he knew what colors things originally were, but he could not see them in his mind. The whole world resembled a "dirty" ashen world to him, and he fell into a depression for a while. After a year or two, though, he saw his vision as being "more refined" than "normal" vision. When a suggestion was made at this time about a surgery that could possibly restore his color vision, he turned it down, preferring to stay in the world he had grown used to rather than to readjust to the old world.

</li><li> Chris Christie was a fairly popular governor in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey">New Jersey</a> (and a rare Republican one at that) in 2011 when there was speculation that he might run for President. Christie had to have a press conference to say he was not going to run, citing that he felt it was better to put his duties as governor and the state rather than use his short stint as govenor to springboard to a better office. Four years later, he ran for president anyway, but numerous corruption scandals in the interim scuttled his political career.
</li><li> Kalaupapa, Hawaii was founded in 1866 as a leper colony where Hawaiians with Hansen's disease—aka leprosy—were sent until 1969. By then, the disease was treatable, but when the state government tried to close the colony, many former patients wished to stay because they knew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque">their disfigurements would make returning to normal society all but impossible</a> and they had formed a community among themselves.

As of the 2010 census, less than a dozen of the original patients remain, all quite elderly, and most of the site is now a National Historic Park.

In 1821, the Portuguese Constituent Cortes were inclining to return Brazil to its former colony status, (which caused revolt among Brazilians who would oppose any political regressions) and one of the Cortes' demands was that Pedro would go back to Portugal. On 9 January 1822, he was presented with a petition containing 8,000 signatures that begged him not to leave. He replied, "Since it is for the good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. Tell the people that I am staying." Eight months later, he declared the Brazilian independence and in December 1st <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentofCrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentofCrowning">was crowned Emperor of Brazil</a>. After years of rule and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">series of conflicts involving the Portuguese throne</a>, Pedro abdicated and left to Europe again.
