This frequently occurs when a show uses garish or outlandish designs, where subtlety and fine physical detail are already lost, and we need a quick visual aid that other characters may not seem to notice.
</p><p>If a family is the stereotypical four-member "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearFamily">nuclear</a>" one, the children will usually resemble the respective same-sex parents.
</p><p>In an attempt to mix things up, however, there may be a family in which the children resemble the respective opposite-sex parents instead. Another common variant is to have the children look nearly identical to the respective same-sex parents, but with the hair or eye colors of the opposite-sex ones.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ActiveRaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ActiveRaid">Active Raid</a></em>, the only difference between two Yamabuki sisters, Rin and Hinata, is their eye color. Despite the fact that the latter one is in high school, while her older sister is a police officer.
</li><li> While not very closely resembling her half-sisters at all, Urd of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> is a dead-ringer for her own mother, Queen Hild. If it weren't for Hild's slight height advantage, different hairstyle, and slightly larger bust they could pretty easily be mistaken for one another.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu">Angel Densetsu</a></em>, Kitano looks a <em>lot</em> like his father. Which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">very sad for him</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsatteNoHoukou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsatteNoHoukou">Asatte no Houkou</a></em>, Adult!Karada looks just like her mother Youko.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove">Asteroid in Love</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mira Kinohata and her mother Yuko look very similar; the only difference is height and the fact that Yuko likes to tie her hair up into a bun. In addition, they text in a similar style that includes a large number of (LINE) stamps. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshading</a> this point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Ao</a> and her mother Shiori commented "Like daughter, like mother" when they read Yuko's text.
</li><li> In terms of appearance, Chikage Sakurai looks like her older sister Mikage but with longer and redder hair. Mai particularly notes the strong resemblance between the two siblings.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> Eren Yeager looks almost identical to his mother Carla, the only actual differences being their eye colors and Carla's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherlySidePlait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherlySidePlait">Motherly Side Plait</a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRvzDOAZtZDp_yqfCE-ouqhNtXdyOU5LUmqG7U_SElhB2HhsftY">Just<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSTgMdaaEMXLbtUaZ9PXrrqaLxFuNkS9a9FP3TEgodfBlmglf7J">look<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The way the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">nations</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> are related can be a little confusing, but England and Sealand are most certainly related. Sealand looks like a younger, more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild">hyper</a> England.
<ul><li> If Germany were to grow his hair long, he'd be identical to his ancestor, Germania. His older brother, Prussia, also shares a certain resemblance with them, though his eye and hair color sets him apart.
<ul><li> Muss up Germany's hair and he ends up looking just like Prussia in the webcomics. Similarly, slick Prussia's hair back and he looks like a slightly older Germany with white hair and reddish eyes.
</li><li> Depending on whether or not you believe that Germany is related to the Holy Roman Empire, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or <em>is</em> the Holy Roman Empire</span>, you can't deny that HRE looks like a younger Germany, and that Germany bears a resemblance to the sketch of teenage HRE when his hair isn't slicked back. Meanwhile, in North America, Canada and the U.S. look identical to the point that poor Canada is often mistaken for his more noticeable brother. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> has it that they're twins. South Italy looks to be a darker, meaner, and slightly taller version of North Italy, and is otherwise completely the same. Several of England's relatives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">apparently share</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlEyebrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlEyebrows">his eyebrows</a>.
</li><li> Don't forget that both Italies strongly resemble their grandfather Ancient Rome. Both inherited the curls, Veneziano got his smile and brown eyes, and Romano got the olive complexion and dark hair.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Slavic side, Russia and his older sister Ukraine look pretty similar: they're both tall, light-haired, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmBigBoned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmBigBoned">a little pudgy</a> and with similar features except for Russia's nose. If we add their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Genderflip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Genderflip">genderflipped</a> versions, the similarity is even stronger: male!Ukraine is basically a more insecure Russia with yellower hair, while female!Russia is a long-haired and more smily Ukraine. As for Belarus, her coloring matches Russia's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteHairBlackHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteHairBlackHeart">platinum blond hair, pale skin,</a> blue or purple eyes), she's also tall with a rounded face (though more angular features), <a class="urllink" href="http://blog-imgs-24-origin.fc2.com/h/i/m/himaruya/siryo3.jpg">she has a bit of a Cleopatra Nose herself<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, shares Russia's ability to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">downright frightening</a> expressions, and under that dress she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobsOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobsOfSteel">quite curvy</a>, though skinnier than Ukraine.
</li><li> Subverted with Switzerland and Liechtenstein. They're not exactly siblings (more like adoptive sibs, though it's easy to infer they're at least distantly related due to being Germanic), but they look almost exactly alike save for their eyes. And even more when Liech cuts off her braids.
</li><li> Also subverted with Cyprus and Greece. He <em>does</em> look like a younger and slimmer Greece... but lacks his trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair">Idiot Hair</a>.
</li><li> Without his hairclip holding his bangs, Norway looks very similar to his younger brother Iceland. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> notes that Sweden's face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">is similar to Germany and Prussia's faces</a>, and explains it by revealing that Sweden has family ties to Germania.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>: The manga, doesn't show us any of the girls' parents (unless you count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Chiyo's dad</a>) but in the show, we get a brief glimpse of Kaorin's mother, who is basically a slightly taller Kaorin in an apron. We're also told that Tomo and her father had the same hairstyle at some point.
</li><li> This is the case for the Laforets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>, where you can probably pick out one of them from a sea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> on the basis that they're all nearly identical to their father, Huey.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts">Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts</a></em>: Minami's little sister, Hazuki, looks like a miniature version of her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>, when Akito Takagi and Moritaka Mashiro look through a yearbook that Moritaka's uncle Nobuhiro "Taro Kawaguchi" Mashiro had, they realize that Miho Azuki's mother, Miyuki Haruno, looks quite a bit like Miho did when she was in high school.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleSpiritsShonenToppaBashin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleSpiritsShonenToppaBashin">Battle Spirits Shonen Toppa Bashin</a></em>, the protagonist, Toppa, looks like he could be a younger version of his father. Additionally, Striker looks near identical to his father, down to the same improbable scythe-like hairdo. Of his four younger siblings, two of them share a more subdued version of Striker and his father's hair, and two have the same hairstyle as the mother.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Kei</a> in ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheBeautifulSkiesOfHououHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheBeautifulSkiesOfHououHigh">The Beautiful Skies of Houou High</a>' looks almost like a younger version of her father.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> An intresting example: when Guts and Casca's child first appears it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque">looks nothing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetusTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetusTerrible">like its parents</a>.

Very apparent when <a class="urllink" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQ1NaKCKo02lwQ-ao_6JZjcnahpJzYac2A-o5kg8mR_kdZnsBF4">all three<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are pictured together.
</li><li> Farnese has the same face as her mother. The only differences are a different haircut and demeanor.
</li><li> Serpico has some similar features to his father Federico, especially his narrow eyes (in the rare occasion Serpico <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut">opens them</a>) but his half brothers look more like their father.
<ul><li> Farnese and Serpico bear more than a few <a class="urllink" href="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQTPbDllSbBRwCY9Ec6JdXB8cS5NR3ZlSPUuXXgaNr8QyQAK9pOzuZoL-1NHA">similarities<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is unsurprising considering they're half siblings.
</li></ul></li><li> Miscellaneous examples include Theresia from the first arc, who is identical to her mother, and Princess Charlotte, who apparently looks the late Queen. This becomes gross and creepy when her father the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad">King</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">nearly rapes her</a> because of the resemblance.
</li></ul></li><li> Ciel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> already looks almost exactly like his late father, Earl Vincent Phantomhive, and will definitely be a carbon copy of him once he's older. He <em>was</em> shown as an adult in the 'Ciel in Wonderland 2' OVA and the resemblance was striking. And considering Sebastian has taken the appearance of Earl Phantomhive, except for the eyes, this could raise some interesting questions when he's older.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Byakuya is the spitting image of his deceased father, Soujun. The only difference between them is the way they wear their hair.
</li><li> The Omaeda siblings all look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk-style</a> clones of their parents, male and female both. The youngest sister Mareyo is the only one who looks different, being stunningly beautiful and catching the eye of all the male shinigami. Her family, however, think she's the ugly duckling.
</li><li> Ryuuken and Uryuu could be mistaken for brothers instead of father and son, especially since Ryuuken looks younger than his forty-something years. Uryuu does get his black hair and some of his more pensive facial expressions from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">Kanae</a>, but otherwise he's his father's son from head to toe. <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.is/N11od">This post shows the three together.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Rukia is nearly identical to her older sister Hisana Kuchiki, right down to favoring the same hairstyles until Rukia gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a> in the X-Cution arc. This stands out because Hisana abandoned Rukia as an infant and then died before the pair could ever be reunited. The uncanny resemblance is lampshaded in the story when it's revealed Byakuya's original lie for adopting Rukia was her resemblance to his dead wife.
</li><li> Yuushirou and his older sister Yoruichi look damn near identical, despite their difference in age and gender. When Yoruichi was younger, <a class="urllink" href="http://s634.photobucket.com/user/Ezone525/media/manga-rainbleach-ch130-10.png.html">she<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was virtually identical to <a class="urllink" href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/4356520-3904695840-80559.jpg">him.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> It even gets lampshaded very amusingly.
</li><li> Towards the end of the manga, two young children are featured. On one hand <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ichigo's son Kazui looks like a younger Ichigo, but with his mother Orihime's eyes and facial expressions</span>. On the other, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rukia's daughter Ichika has her mother's features (especially her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TsurimeEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TsurimeEyes">Tsurime Eyes</a>), plus her father Renji's spikey red hair</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist">Blue Exorcist</a></em> has an unusual case considering Kato's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">Cast of Snowflakes</a> art style. Most of the time you can merely tell that they are related by similar features, but in the case of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kamiki family</span> all them look so alike they might as well be <em>clones</em>. Considering they are apparently descendant from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a Byakko</span> and have spent generations focused on a single ritual and specific abilities, this might be justified.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai">Bokura no Hentai</a></em>:
<ul><li> Marika has a strong resemblance to her mother, made even more obvious when she grows out her hair.
</li><li> Ryousuke looked like a short haired version of his deceased older <em>sister</em> in elementary. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It goes the other way around too as apparently Yui was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">tomboy</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyishShortHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyishShortHair">Boyish Short Hair</a> until she became a model.</span> Marika even mistook her for Ryousuke in family photos.
</li></ul></li><li> When returning to her home in Osaka in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BurnUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BurnUp">Burn Up Excess</a></em>, Maya Jingu visits the memorial shrine to her mother—whose photograph looks exactly like her, albeit in a gangster kimono with tulip yakuza tattoos. It helps that the late Jingu was probably not much older than Maya was, and is grinning gunslinger in the portrait.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em> has a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">Only Six Faces</a>, but it still qualifies in this trope:
<ul><li> Tsubasa Ohzora resembles both of his parents, inheriting Natsuko's features and Koudai's hair/eye colors. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In <em>World Youth Cup</em> his <em>14-year-younger</em> brother Daichi appears, and he's a spitting image of Tsubasa himself.</span>
</li><li> Jun Misugi and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Taro Misaki</span> resemble their respective mothers. In the second case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Taro's half-sister Yoshiko</span> also resembles their mom — and <em>him</em>.
</li><li> Regarding the Schneider family, Karl-Heinz strongly resembles his father Rudi whereas his younger sister Marie looks like their mother.
</li><li> Averted with the Konsawatto brothers, who look <em>nothing</em> alike.
</li></ul></li><li> Misaka Mikoto of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> looks much like her mother.
</li><li> Akira Maeda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool">Cromartie High School</a></em> is "renowned throughout Japan for his startling resemblance to his mother", as it's put in the manga. His friends keep confusing the two of them. They were also played by the same actor in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">live-action adaptation</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has the lead character <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tatsuorg/images/0/00/83515681.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140216160534&amp;path-prefix=es">Lelouch vi Britannia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who might as well be a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a></em> of <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/codegeass/images/c/c4/Marianne_Britannia.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111223105403">his mother<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> down to skin complexion, hair color, eye color, and eye shape.

That said in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel">R2</a> this ends up useful as it gets a dangerous assassin sent after him to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> <em>because</em> of how much he resembles his mother confirms he's her son and thus one said assassin has sworn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a> to.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, as one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long-Runners</a>, has MANY cases of this:
<ul><li> Yusaku Kudo and his son Shinichi look almost exactly the same (Yuusaku has glasses and a funky mustache, Shinichi has a cowlick and a pointy rat-tail). The physical similarities <strong>went off the ceiling</strong> when the fans saw <a class="urllink" href="http://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/File:Young_Yusaku.jpg">Yusaku at age 20<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>: if his face was rounder and his eyes were bigger, he'd be an exact <em>clone</em> of Shinichi.
</li><li> The same goes for Kaitou KID and Shinichi; even though nobody knows whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">or not</a> they're related.
</li><li> Actually, a <em>huge</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">plot point</a> in a case of the fifth season. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The detective Yusuke Sakata, whose father died in strange circumstances 20 years ago, confronts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>. Much to his shock, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> starts referring to him as "Instructor Inaba" and babbling in <em>horror</em> about how "the prank went too far". That obviously, referred to the death of Sakata's dad Inaba, which he and other five people caused through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyPrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyPrank">Deadly Prank</a>. Yusuke, who had become a policeman to investigate what went on with his father, <em>became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> himself</em>, catching and murdering the other culprits while keeping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> alive and hidden while planning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">to kill him last and frame him for all the deaths.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">All to punish those who robbed him of his dad when he was a little boy</a></span>. And on the other hand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this was also Yusuke's perdition: at some point Heiji and Conan saw a picture that included all of the victims plus other two persons whom Yusuke had still not killed... as well as Inaba himself. This lets them notice how physically alike Yusuke and Inaba were, identifying Yusuke as the killer</span>.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> case from the second season, a young woman who looked a lot like her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> of a mother was among the suspects <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfmadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfmadeOrphan">of the lady's murder</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She <em>didn't</em> do it, but she <em>did</em> try to use their resemblance to her advantage: she had found her mom's corpse and, panicking over the possibility of being blamed, she put on the lady's bed clothes and a facial treatment mask to impersonate the dead woman and throw suspicions off herself.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">Babies Ever After</a> scene at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> played this unsettlingly straight, right down to the last child. Between that and the conspicuous absence from the reunion of any spouses who aren't former Chosen Children, it's a popular snark among fans dissatisfied with the ending to suggest that they all just cloned themselves.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em>, physical traits seem to run very consistently in the family. Doraemon has a design similar to his little sister Dorami, although she's meant to be cuter, even though she doesn't have cat ears either for some reason like her brother (who's supposed to have lost his ears to mice; all of his friends in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/DoraemonTheDoraemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/DoraemonTheDoraemons">The Doraemons</a></em> still have their ears). Nobita looks almost exactly like his mother (though she got the delicate female mouth later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">as the author got better with his drawings</a>), and also like his father as a child, and also like his future son with Shizuka, and also his grandson who sent (will have sent?) Doraemon back to the past to help him get his crap together. Shizuka looks exactly like her mother minus the two pigtails. Gian looks exactly like his mother and little sister; his father only appears a few times early on in the manga, more frequently in the anime, but he also shares the family physical traits. Suneo looks exactly like both of his parents who, oddly enough, look exactly like each other. Suneos younger brother and older cousin also look like exactly like him. Gian and Suneo look like their future sons respectively.
</li><li> This is very common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The most obvious example is Goten, who looks (and acts) like Goku when he was a kid; this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the games where he and a younger version of Goku appear. Goten may have initially been created to fill the 'young Goku role' left as the real Goku was too aged and Gohan was evolving into his own character, but that didn't work out too well. Since not every child in the series has such a strong family resemblance, it also removes lingering doubts that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">often absent</a> Goku isn't his father...
</li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZBattleOfGods">Battle of Gods</a></em> lampshades this: when Pilaf and his goons see Goten, they mistake him for Goku and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">are scared out of their wits</a>.
</li><li> Goten himself later on lets his hair grow out as a means of distancing himself from his strong resemblance to his dad.
</li><li> Gohan also has some resemblance to his mother Chi-Chi, inheriting her light peach skin tone and some facial expressions, while inheriting Goku's eyes. Though he ends up looking more like Goku as an adult.
</li><li> Similarly, the few times Vegeta's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a> King Vegeta is seen, he looks pretty much like an older Vegeta with a few minor differences: brown hair, a slightly sturdier build, and a goatee.
<ul><li> In an anime movie, Vegeta's great-great-grandson shows up and he looks identical to a young Vegeta (It's unknown if he descends from Trunks or Bulla). And said Vegeta Jr.'s mother looks like Bulma, only with spikier hair.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of Bulma, her daughter Bulla takes her looks while Trunks has inherited his mother's coloring.
</li><li> Trunks' facial features are identical to Vegeta's (except softer and with a longer face), the only huge difference being his eye color and hair. The first time Future Trunks shows up, Bulma even comments how he and Vegeta look alike.
</li><li> As seen in the pic above: Goku's father Bardock is nearly identical to his son, except for scars and a slight difference in facial shape.
</li><li> Incidentally, the resemblance is "second son identical to his father": Goku is Bardock's second son while Goten is Goku's second.
</li><li> Bardocks first son Raditz has his mother Gines hair. Pan, Gines great granddaughter resembles her along with Chi-Chi and Videl.
</li><li> More like "second child identical to one of the parents". Bulla looks exactly like Bulma, and is her second child with Vegeta.
<ul><li> Interestingly enough, Gohan's hair resembles that of his father's older brother Raditz when it's ankle-length, though it <em>does</em> manage a Goku-ish shape during the Cell Games. Although that could be because Goku himself cut it.
</li><li> Or what Gohan's second child, if a son, would look like... Though Gohan's great-grandson, Goku Jr., looks identical to Goku, though with his grandmother Pan's eyes.
</li></ul></li><li> Apparently this all has to do with Saiyan genes. It's a form of identification to tell the weak Saiyans from the strong ones easily through facial features and whatnot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Frieza</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">father</a> strongly resemble each other as well, though it could be a quirk of their species.
</li><li> Krillin and Android 18's daughter Marron looked like Krillin with pigtails as a toddler. As a young girl, she resembles her mother. Which raises questions as Krillin's lack of nose is a plot point<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note01oq5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note01oq5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note01oq5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He uses it and the accompanied lack of sense of smell to beat a stink-villain, Bacterian</span>; Marron has no nose like him as a toddler, but gains one as a young girl.
<ul><li> Lastly, an extremely subtle example with Android 16's eyes being the exact same (shape and colour) as Dr. Gero/Android 20, which makes sense as 16 is modelled after Gero's deceased son.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2008 special reveals that Vegeta has a younger brother, Tarble, who looks like a much younger version of both his dad and big brother. In fact, he's near identical to the pre-teen Vegeta from the Bardock movie, save for the shorter hair and smaller eyebrows.
</li></ul></li><li> Not only does <a class="urllink" href="http://images.wikia.com/duelmasters/images/e/e3/Shobu.jpg">Shobu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DuelMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DuelMasters">Duel Masters</a></em> look almost exactly <a class="urllink" href="http://images.wikia.com/duelmasters/images/c/c9/Shori.jpg">the same as his<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAnatomyAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAnatomyAging">Animation Anatomy Aging</a> the only real difference), but the two even dress the same.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FatherAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FatherAndSon">Father and Son</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> Shou is noted to looking exactly like his father when he was little. When he and Youichi are in Bungo's cake shop, there are a few pictures, which show Youichi as a kid.

<ul><li> Naruto, especially after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> and puberty, looks just like his father, Minato. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His son Boruto in the epilogue looks near-identical to Naruto as well (with his mother Hinata's round face)...though Naruto somewhat lessens his resemblance to both his father and his son by cutting his hair much shorter.</span>
</li><li> Most of the Konoha 11 look like younger versions of their parents, especially the Ino-Shika-Cho trio. Hinata's mother, who was only shown in a flashback <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">in the anime</a>, strongly resembles her after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>.
</li><li> In Chapter 498 Naruto meets his mother Kushina, and at one point she mentions Naruto has her face and Minato's hair.
</li><li> Kakashi Hatake is said to look just like his father Sakumo, and indeed, several characters (Chiyo, for example) have already confused the two. For the readers it's a bit harder to tell, though it's known that two of them share their hair and eye colour. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Kakashi's face is <em>finally</em> shown in an artbook and then in the anime, it's confirmed: he <em>does</em> look like a younger version Sakumo, plus finer features and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyMark">Beauty Mark</a>.</span>
</li><li> The Uchihas, especially those whose first names are known, seem to all look the same, to the point that they can only be differentiated by subtle features unique to each individual. Subtracting the bags under Madara's eyes, or Izuna's distinct upper lip, or Itachi's tear troughs, will result in Sasuke. Mikoto Uchiha is literally a female Sasuke with long hair. True to form, she's incredibly pretty.
</li><li> Shisui Uchiha looked very much like his ascendant Kagami. Their personalities are strikingly similar as well.
</li><li> Gaara and Kankuro both look a lot like their father Rasa aka the Kazekage, while appearing somewhat different themselves; same goes for Temari and their mother Karura. Karura's younger brother Yashamaru looked so similar to his dead sister that the fans mistakenly thought that either Yashamaru was a woman (until he was heard speaking) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins">Half-Identical Twins</a>.
</li><li> Kiba Inuzuka bears a strong resemblance to his mother, Tsume. Interestingly, his older sister Hana looks nothing like Tsume, and is clearly lacking a lot of the feral-looking Inuzuka traits present in her mother and brother. It makes one wonder what Kiba and Hana's absentee father looks like.
</li><li> The Hyugas in general tend to have strong resemblance, especially when their hair is long. Hanabi looks like a young Hinata with longer hair, Neji resembles his late father Hizashi (and cousin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady">Hinata</a>), and most other relatives look quite alike. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hinata's daughter Himawari has a spikier variation of her mother's hair pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, as well as her father's traits such as blue eyes and face-whiskers.

Sarada has the face and hair color of Sasuke and the forehead and eyebrows of Sakura. Shikadai looks exactly like Shikamaru in his younger days, except with Temari's eyes. Inojin has Ino's hair and Sai's skin and his face is a combination of both. Chocho is fat like her father Choji and got his hair color, but her skin is black like Karui's. A boy who is training with Lee looks very similar to him, and later he's confirmed to be his son Metal. Asuma and Kurenai's daughter, Mirai, looks also similar to them, with her mom's features and her dad's hairstyle. Even Akamaru's puppy looks also similar to him, but with different ears.</span>

</li><li> Kinkaku and Ginkaku, who are either fraternal twins, or half-siblings. Upon looking, fandom considered them twins. But their fourth databook info caused a bit of confusion. Their ages are the same, both being 44. But their blood-types and birthdays are different. Kinkaku being A, born March 7th, and Ginkaku being AB, born April 9th. In any case, they are not identical twins, but look <a class="urllink" href="http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/silverfang2/29185537/553562/553562_original.png">similar<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/silverfang2/29185537/553999/553999_original.png">enough.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> Ginkaku just looks like a smaller/skinnier version of Kinkaku.

The resemblance is <strong>disturbingly</strong> striking, without the two of them looking like lazily designed age-clones.
</li><li> Shinji also resembles his mother, Yui. It helps Shinji was designed to have a female looking face.
</li><li> Ritsuko Akagi, as it turns out, shares quite a resemblance to her mother Naoko, as seen in episode 21 where we learn that she wasn't a natural blonde - save for her characteristic mole on her cheek, Ritsuko would look a <em>lot</em> like her mother when she's older if you were to superimpose her original hair colour over her current one. Much like the Shinji-Gendo similarity above, this is intended to be a display of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>, and rather disturbingly so - even her hair and clothing styles become more like Naoko's as she gets older, not to mention <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her sleeping with Gendo just as her mother had done.</span>
</li><li> And of course, in the <em>most</em> disturbing example and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the most loose definition of <em>family</em> resemblance, Rei Ayanami shares a striking resemblance to the woman from whom she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">at least partially cloned</a> - Yui Ikari, Shinji's mother. It's implied that this is why Gendo doesn't keep any photos of Yui around, since even Naoko noticed immediately. Which makes her Shinji's half-sister... sorta</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Mireille Bouquet of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> looks almost exactly like her deceased mother, Odette, as is mistaken for her when she visits her old home by an old family retainer. They even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantDoubleCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantDoubleCasting">share the same voice actress in both English and Japanese</a>, and the resemblance winds up being a plot point much later.

<ul><li> Usopp and Nico Robin look very much like their parents when they got older. Usopp is a combination of his mother Bachina and his father Yasopp's traits (mom's long nose and hair color, plus dad's hair texture and tanned skin) and Robin is a spitting image of her mother Olvia save for the black hair (her mother's is white).
</li><li> Vivi and her mother Titi. It's so striking that during Vivi's coming of age ceremony, her father almost mistook her for a spitting image of Titi. <a class="urllink" href="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130120233626/onepiece/images/0/04/Titi_Youth.png">Here's what her mother looked like when she was young.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>

First of all, the 2 aforementioned races can not only have children amongs themselves, but interbreed with one another, as well. There's a 25% chance that the baby of say, a mermaid mother and a fishman father will be either a fishman, merman, fishwoman, or mermaid. It's very likely that the child won't resemble either of the parents, because each member of these races will randomly be based on different species of fish and even mollusks too, like octopi and squids.
</li><li> The same rules apply even if the parents are from the same race, although their child will strictly be of the same race as them. For example, King Neptune (a merman) and Queen Otohime (a mermaid) had 4 children, their daughter Shirahoshi and sons Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi, and Manboshi. They look <em>nothing</em> like their folks or each other, for that matter.
</li><li> Another striking resemblance is between Rebecca and her mother Scarlett, who look insanely similar.

The main difference is that Hippolyta has curly hair but Diana's hair is straight, and even then it's inconsistent. Some artists also give them different noses. This is despite Diana not sharing her her mother's DNA due to being born from clay. Presumably she was fashioned completely after Hippolyta.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Like her brothers Ned and Benjen, Lyanna has the classic Stark look of dark hair and eyes, and general austere features. When we see Lyanna's childhood in flashback in episode 6.2, she's introduced wearing a boy's clothing and skillfully riding a horse around the courtyard. She's a tomboy just like her niece Arya will be (though Arya was born years after she died). In the books themselves, Ned outright states that Arya greatly resembles Lyanna at her age. The actress (Aisling Franciosi) also looks a fair bit like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaisieWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaisieWilliams">Maisie Williams</a> (Arya).
</li><li> It is also clear Jon Snow inherited most of his looks from his mother Lyanna, especially his dark hair, eyes, and striking looks, which certainly made it easier for Lyanna's brother Ned (Jon's uncle) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyRelationshipSwitcheroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyRelationshipSwitcheroo">pass him off as his illegitimate son</a>, as opposed to if Jon had taken after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his father Rhaegar Targaryen with the trademark Targaryen silver hair</span>.
</li><li> Sansa looks increasingly like Catelyn as she gets older, even after she dyes her hair black.
</li><li> Bran looks a great deal like Ned and Benjen did as kids.
</li><li> Young Cersei looks <em>strikingly</em> similar to her daughter, Myrcella. The fact that Myrcella's father is Cersei's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">twin brother</a> <em>might</em> have something to do with this, considering they have the exact same genes, give or take a few.
</li><li> With her hair cut off by the Faith Militant, Cersei bears an unsettling resemblance to her son Joffrey. (Ditto with the incest thing.)
</li><li> In the one flashback we finally see him, Rhaegar Targaryen is remarkably identical to his younger brother Viserys, give or take him being more muscular and having a more dignified air. In the books, Daenerys almost confuses Rhaegar with Viserys in the House of the Undying.
</li><li> Though Jon Snow takes after his Stark mother, he <em>is</em> a brooding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">Pretty Boy</a> like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his Targaryen father</span>.
</li><li> The <em>History and Lore</em> videos show that Princess Rhaenys inherited her mother's Dornish look, with black hair and brown eyes.
</li><li> Almost everybody who knew Robert Baratheon comments that his illegitimate son Gendry resembles how he looked when he was young. Gendry is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndHandsome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndHandsome">Tall, Dark, and Handsome</a>, like a true Baratheon. Ned Stark immediately realizes upon seeing him for the first time that he is Robert's son. So does Stannis, when they meet in "Second Sons". In the books, it is said that Gendry resembles a young Robert so closely that it is blatantly obvious to anyone who meets him that also knows Robert (Eddard, Stannis) that Gendry is Robert's son. Given that Renly also resembles his older brother in his youth, people also remark on how much Gendry looks like Renly.

Barney thinks that they look exactly alike, seemingly oblivious to the fact that James is black and, in fact, Barney's half brother. When James eventually is reunited with his father, Sam Gibbs, Barney doesn't seem to understand that he and James are <em>half</em> brothers, and briefly believes that he is African American (this is initially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, until Barney admits that he was just jealous of James for having a father when he doesn't). However, James and Barney have very similar personalities (being close friends while growing up) and tastes in clothing; the only major differences are that James is gay, monogamous, and happily married (and because of the last two, doesn't share Barney's sleazy love of having sex with women, or, in James's case, men).

<div class="indent"><strong>Stuart Millard</strong>: Again, I'm bummed that they didn't outright have Mr. Belding in drag, waddling around with his shoes on his knees, but instead cast an actual teenage girl for the role.

Somewhat inverted, as Sephiroth was mistaken about being descended from the Cetra. Not only is Jenova his genetic donor, not his actual mother (Lucrecia was the surrogate), Jenova is a mimetic creature who took on the shape of the Cetra to destroy them.

Nina (who already greatly resembled her mom) has a daughter named Lillian who looks strikingly similar to her, and Lilian had Popuri who is a mini version of her. Maria is essentially SNES!Maria with a different hairstyle and glasses, and the original Maria resembled her mom a lot. Ann, Gray, and Rick are all redheads related to Ann from the first game. Ellen is essentially her grandmother when she was younger, and her grandmother had more than a passing resemblance to her mom (just significantly thinner). Only Karen and her mother don't resemblance Eve, though Karen's blonde bangs come from Eve. The protagonist is even a copy of his grandfather, down to the clothes.

"Spitting image" doesn't begin to cover it; fans initially assumed Matthew was a <em>redesign</em>. Hilariously, the one character in <em>Dark Dawn</em> who comments on Matthew having a resemblance to a relative <em>compares him to his mother</em> (Briggs never met Isaac).

Jin differs from Kazuya only because he has a fringe like his mother Jun, as well as being more slender and with slightly finer features than Kazuya.
<ul><li> Retroactively, this can now be applied to Jun and Jin. Originally, Jin more closely resembled his father than he did his mother (to the point that many thought Jin in <em>T3</em> was a younger Kazuya), but as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamMatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamMatchGame">Tekken Tag Tournament 2</a></em>, Jun's facial features better match those of her son.

<ul><li> While not shown, NPC dialogue implies that the City Elf Warden bears a great resemblance to their mother Adaia.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, the default designs of Hawke's younger twin siblings are shown to greatly take after their mother's side of the family. Bethany's facial structure is very much like that of their mother Leandra; Carver's closely resembles that of their maternal uncle Gamlen, who himself takes a great deal after his father Aristide. It's also stated that Hawke him/herself very closely resembles their deceased father Malcolm, both in looks and personality.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>,</em> if Morrigan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has a son from either Alistair, Loghain, or the Warden, he looks a lot like his mother</span>.

<ul><li> Roy from <em>The Binding Blade</em> and the teenage version of his father Eliwood from <em>The Blazing Blade</em> look strikingly similar to the point of being nearly identical; it doesn't help that they even wear almost the same clothes, and it takes looking up their full official artwork to see any significant difference between them. Pretty much the biggest difference is that Eliwood was taller, thinner and wore longer sleeves, neither of which can really be gleaned from in-game appearances.
</li><li> Eliwood also looks quite a bit like his own dad Elbert. The older Eliwood seen in <em>The Binding Blade</em> (and <em>The Blazing Blade</em>'s ending) looks almost exactly like Elbert, the biggest difference being that Elbert had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassMustache" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassMustache">Badass Mustache</a> while Eliwood is clean-shaven. It's even acknowledged by Nils in <em>The Blazing Blade</em>, who says that he'd heard Elbert had a son, and immediately realized it must be Eliwood due to their similar appearances.
</li><li> Similarly, Sue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseArcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseArcher">Horse Archer</a> from <em>The Binding Blade</em> is basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">gender flipped</a> version of her father Rath from <em>The Blazing Blade</em>. And sharp-eyed players will notice that she also looks a lot like Lyndis, who got a potential ending with Rath in the <em>The Blazing Blade</em>...
</li><li> Interestingly subverted in the case of Roy's best friend Wolt... whose design, first seen in <em>The Binding Blade</em>, actually served as the basis for the <em>three</em> guys that his mother Rebecca can marry in <em>The Blazing Blade</em>.

Ike and Mist both resemble their same-sex parent while inheriting the opposite-sex parent's hair color. For his part, Soren looks like a younger, male version of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his mother Almedha from <em>Radiant Dawn</em>, and even in <em>Path of Radiance</em>, it was already obvious that Soren had a very strong resemblance to Kurthnaga, the prince of Goldoa, and Rajaion, Ena's fiancé, both of whom were revealed in the next game to be Soren's maternal uncles</span>.

Likewise, a shorter hairstyle is the only noticeable difference between Larcei and her mother Ayra, while Ulster is basically a genderflipped and shorthaired Ayra. Even more so, the grown-up Prince Shannan looks <em>disturbingly</em> like his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>, Ayra's older brother Prince Mariccle.

</li><li> The Avatar (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization">by default</a>) looks very similar to their mother, Mikoto, only with white hair.

Fry learns the truth when he visits Philip's grave and reads the epitaph: "Here Lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle, to carry on his spirit." Yancy had named his son after his missing brother and gave him the clover.

<ul><li> Angela is a near-dead ringer to Demona in terms of facial structure and hairstyle, and she's a spot-on match to Goliath's skin and hair color, and Elisa notices it immediately.
</li><li> The Maza siblings and Alex Xanatos. Elisa most closely resembles their dad Peter, Derek looks most like mom Diane, and Beth resembles both of their parents. Adult Alex looks like David with Fox's bright red hair. (Of course, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> anyway, so who knows if he will actually look like that?)
</li><li> In the graphic novels, Nashville inherits his pale skin and raven-black hair from his mother, Katana, while his horns, wild hairstyle, and pronounced beak come from dad Brooklyn.
</li><li> Likewise, Bronx has Chomp's head shape and Chaw's blue skin, implying that the latter two are his parents.

They have no knowledge pink isn't her natural hair color so, while showing her phony home videos of herself as a child, they hire an actress who looks <em>exactly</em> like Jem to play her mother. This only makes Jerrica more confused and distraught.
</li><li> Ba Nee looks like a child version of her mother.
</li><li> Used as a plot point. Danse resemblances her deceased mom that she never met quite a lot.
</li><li> Surprisingly averted with most families. If anything most people don't resemblance their family enough. Kimber has a bright red hair tone neither her sister nor parents have, Video and Clash are cousins who look nothing alike (which is realistic but in fiction cousins tend to have passing resemblances), and Raya is the only member of her family with <em>pink</em> hair.

Colonel Hathi (Hathi Jr.'s father) from the same series for some reason looks exactly like his father-in-law (Winifred's father).

The exceptions being Lincoln who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">strongly resembles his grandfather</a> down to the white hair, and Lucy looks like an exact copy of her great grandmother.

<ul><li> Marinette and her mother Sabine have similar facial features, the same colored hair and are around the same height, though Sabine has lighter eyes.
</li><li> In an older concept for the show, Chat Noir was going to be called Félix and be a much less sympathetic character (though presumably he'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">take a level in kindness</a> as the show went on.) He looked pretty much the same. So when Félix <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag">shows up as Adrien's cousin</a> looking much like the original concept art and promotional video (and therefore much like Adrien) he can actually impersonate him. The resemblance gets an explanation, though: their mothers are twins. (We don't see Félix's dad, though.)

</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> "Baby" characters looked and were named exactly like their mothers, except for less markings on their hide.

(Now, that doesn't explain Baby Lickety-Split having an identical <em>cousin.</em>)
<ul><li> The highly standardised character designs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> make this common. Twilight Sparkle's mother is a pallet swap of her daughter. In a slightly less exceptional case, Pumpkin Cake has the exact same colors as her father Carrot Cake, same with Apple Bloom and her father Bright Macintosh. "Magic Duel" shows that, with a little dye and mane-styling, Sweetie Belle looks almost exactly like her big sister Rarity back when she was Sweetie's age as they have the same coat color and are both unicorns. The Flim-Flam brothers are basically identical except for their marks and Flam's moustache.
<ul><li> This can make the exceptions stick out like a sore thumb. For instance, Pinkie's sisters all look very similar to one another, but Pinkie herself nothing like <em>any</em> of her immediate family members. Though when Pinkie's mane goes flat, she's a dead ringer for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolarOppositeTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolarOppositeTwins">twin sister Marble</a>, only pink instead of gray.
</li><li> Speaking of Rainbow Dash, her mother Windy Whistles is basically her daughter, minus the rainbow mane her father Bow Hothoof has.
</li><li> Fluttershy's mother also counts, one difference being her hair is dark red and she wears it in a different style than her pink-haired daughter.
</li><li> Spitfire is basically a copy of her mother Stormy Flare, with one difference: Stormy doesn't have the copypasted mare design, so her face is notably less round than her daughter's.
</li><li> Trixie's father Jack Pot looks like a male version of her, and even shares a similar stage magician persona as his daughter.

Herb is a slightly older version of what Homer would look like if he had never lost his hair or gained so much weight, while their half-sister Abby is what Homer would look like if he got rid of the five-o-clock shadow and dressed in drag.
</li><li> Homer also looks quite a bit like his mother, Mona — they have very similar head/face shapes.
