<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Uchiha Itachi</span> is probably the most intense example available, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it involved him killing his parents and entire clan (except Sasuke), making himself a wanted mass murderer in the eyes of the whole world, and making his brother hate him so intensely that Sasuke chases him for years just to kill him</span>, all so that the world could know peace. He then also had to adopt the mask of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">Akatsuki</a> member for years, something he hated, just to keep up the act and continue to be of use to Konoha by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">keeping the Akatsuki away from the village</span>. The gambit worked in that another major war didn't occur for about eight years. As for how it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">affected Sasuke</span>...
</li><li> In a lighter example (though tragic as well), under the Fourth Kazekage's orders Yashamaru told Gaara that he'd never loved him and in fact hated him, that Gaara was not and never would be loved, because he blamed Gaara for his sister's death, and that his sister had also never loved Gaara and was using him to exact revenge on Suna. In reality, Yashamaru did legitimately love him, and the person he truly hated was the Fourth Kazekage, Gaara's father and Yashamaru's brother-in-law. Karura, Gaara's mother, also loved him: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in fact, her love is what truly drives the sand to protect her son</span>. If anyone was to blame for this, it was the Fourth Kazekage, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after being revived by the Edo Tensei admitted he did not deserve to be called Father by his youngest son.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is also Sasuke's motivation behind wanting to be the Hokage. By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit">shouldering all of the hatred of the shinobi world on himself</a>, he'll be able to create a world of peace. It doesn't take off, as Naruto puts a stop to it before it can begin.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lelouch</span> sets himself up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">the emperor of the world</a> and runs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Britannia</a> with an iron fist. He does this in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit">unite the world against a single, common enemy</a>; i.e., himself. Once this is accomplished, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he has Suzaku assume the identity of Zero. He then orders Suzaku to assassinate him in public in the guise of Zero, thus causing the world to rally behind its hero and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">eliminating the last source of hatred on Earth</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight">It works</a>.</span> Bonus points for being an accidental pun on this trope.
</li><li> Taiga's run for Student Council President in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Toradora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Toradora">Toradora!</a></em> was essentially this. Declaring that if elected she'd essentially be an Evil High School Overlord was part of a plan to get the reluctant Kitamura to step up to the plate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> as the other students were perfectly aware of it.
</li><li> Jintetsu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kurogane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kurogane">Kurogane</a></em> does this almost compulsively, since he thinks so little of himself. The most prominent example is when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">doesn't tell Makoto who really ruined her family (her adopted "father", Renji). This leads her to continue to believe he (Jintetsu) had done it, thus allowing her to maintain her fond memories of Renji</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roy Mustang did this when he enacted a plan to make it appear that he burned Maria Ross to death (it was actually a fake cadaver, and Ross was being sneaked out of the country). Ross was under arrest for the murder of Maes Hughes and was to be executed, so Mustang saved her life while making it appear to the higher ups that his desire for vengeance was quenched. All the while, Ross's friends and family continue to think she's dead, making Mustang a bloodthirsty murderer in their eyes (at least until they learn the truth).</span>
</li><li> Anthy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> combines this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask">The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask</a>. It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's an ancient Goddess-Princess who watched her brother, the God-Prince, being blamed for all the evil on earth. As a child, she decided to take the blame and let herself be punished by the world for all eternity. She subsequently spends the entire series serene and calm, while suffering the anguish and hatred of the entire world... because her brother coped by becoming evil instead. Eventually subverted when it turns out that <em>none</em> of it was necessary, and all it took for her to change her situation is to overcome her fear of change and simply walk away.</span>
</li><li> In the Edolas arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, Mystogan wants to paint himself as the villain who made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">the magic go away</a> (it actually <em>was</em> his fault) so that Pantherlily can kill him and be the hero who will unite Edolas in their time of panic. Pantherlily wants to do it the other way around. In the end, however, it is resolved when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Natsu</a> steps up as the <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Great Demon King Dragneel</a></strong> so no one has to die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRecordOfAFallenVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRecordOfAFallenVampire">The Record of a Fallen Vampire</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The humans and the vampire distrust each other. They distrust each other so much that there's a war just waiting to be launched, which would very likely destroy the world. Strauss' solution? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Take on everyone's hate</a>; both human, vampire, and dhampire, so that they will always have a common enemy to unite against, despite them STILL not liking each other.</span> If that's not a Zero Approval Gambit, nothing is.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Especially since it only works while he's alive</span>; He's literally borne the hatred of all three races on his back for thousands of years, all while trying to revive his Queen <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who he didn't truly love, and having to kill the reincarnation/soul of his slain children in the form of the curse of the Black Swan.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpecialA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpecialA">Special A</a></em> we discover that antagonist Yahiro Saiga pulled one of these years ago. Having discovered that one of Akira's friends was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> who was only interested in using her for her money, Yahiro used his family's wealth and his own skill as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> to force the girl to transfer. Akira discovered this, and rather than telling her why he did it, Yahiro let her think of him as a monster and maintain her happy memories of her friendship. Flashforward a few years to the series, and Akira still hates him for what he did, as do Yahiro's ex-friend Kei and most of the Special A class. He doesn't try to correct their image of him and instead plays the villain until well into the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> has a two-person variation, wherein Zechs Merquise and Treize Khushrenada put themselves in charge of the militaries of the space colonies and Earth, respectively, and then start the biggest, most terrible war they can so the common man will finally realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a> and actually do something to prevent it. This is apparently somewhat subtle in the anime; the manga and novelization have Zechs come right out and admit to this trope.
</li><li> The entire first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> is essentially this. Celestial Being appears all of a sudden and declares war against all three factions (The Union of Free Nations and Solar Energy (the Americas, Japan and Australia), the Advanced European Union (Europe and Africa) and the Human Reform League (Russia, China and India)). Eventually, it is revealed that the small group of Celestial Being's members that the series revolves around are largely expendable, and that the goal all along was essentially to piss off the three largest military powers in the world enough to make them join forces against Celestial Being, thus uniting the world and bringing an end to conflict. It didn't work out quite as intended, as Season 2 introduces the A-LAWS, who themselves causes even more devastating conflicts than Season 1 had.
</li><li> Partially averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em> where in the fourth season, Inazuma Eleven GO, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Gouenji Shuuya</a> of all people turned heel and took on the name Ishido Shuuji <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold">in order to save soccer</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Senguuji Daigo</span>. It is partially averted since quite a few people in-universe knows he's actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gouenji and vice-versa</span> such that it doesn't hurt his reputation that much to anyone inside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall">Fourth Wall</a>. In the end, his gambit paid off and his position transitioned to the leadership of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> leader and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> Hibiki Seigou, thereby ensuring the safety of soccer for everyone. Funnily, it was played straight with the fandom.
</li><li> In an early arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, Guts taunts Theresa after he just killed her monstrous Apostle father the Count. Theresa furiously swears that she'll kill Guts someday, somehow. Guts sneers at this, but the moment he turns his head away he looks like he's on the brink of tears. After his own painful daddy issues are revealed, it's clear in hindsight that Guts was just trying to give Theresa something to help her deal with her grief.

He is well aware that he's committing political suicide by continuing to talk of diplomacy when no one else was, lampshading it himself when he first brings up the idea of a trade (give away Guantanamo Bay and the US missiles in Turkey) by remarking that someone should be the coward and it may as well be him, an old political cat<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15f4a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15f4a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15f4a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He was the Democratic nominee for President in 1952 and 1956, both times losing to Eisenhower</span> with little to look forward to in his twilight years.

</li><li> Ned Stark, again - if R+L=J is true (as it is in the TV series). Jon is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. This would make him the heir to the throne, and one of only three known surviving Targaryens. Only Jon's parents and Ned knew his true identity; with their deaths, and given Robert Baratheon's hatred of the Targaryens and desire to kill them all, Ned lies and claims Jon's parents are himself and an unknown prostitute.

<ul><li> Often a strategy employed by coaches or trainers of sports teams: the goal is to force teammates to put aside whatever personal differences they might have by subjecting them to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, thus bonding over their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">mutual hatred</a> for the guy putting them through it. Famously employed by Olympic Hockey Coach Herb Brooks for the 1980 US team. His use of the Gambit enabled him to overcome bitter inter-collegiate rivalries among individual team members and get them all working together as a team, united in their hatred of <em>him</em>. Thanks to this training, the team took the gold medal against very long odds, and to this day, members of that team still speak of Brooks as the most brutal coach they've ever had.
<ul><li> This is also used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">the military</a>, except in the military going through hell continues as they do their job.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2012 Washington Nationals decision to shut down ace pitcher Stephen Strasburg after reaching an innings limit. It was said to be good for Strasburg's arm <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2xhh8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2xhh8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2xhh8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Strasburg tore his ulnar collateral ligament in 2010, forcing him to undergo Tommy John surgery and miss the entire 2011 season</span>, but hated by the national media, especially since the team was in a pennant race.
</li><li> Similar to the Strasburg example, Chicago Bulls player Derrick Rose was medically cleared to play after injuring his knee the previous season, but refused to out of not wanting to risk another injury and not being mentally ready.
</li><li> General Ulysses S Grant's <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overland_Campaign">Overland Campaign<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can be seen as a Zero Approval Gambit in the context of the Generals that came before. The Overland Campaign consisted of a series of tactical defeats wrapped in an overall strategic victory. With over 55,000 casualties Grant was denounced in the press as a butcher and the losses even put serious pressure on President Abraham Lincoln in an election year. The strategy to constantly engage General Lee and then maneuver around him forced the Confederate army into an irreversible retreat, but the overall objectives tended to be lost on the public which were focused on the battlefield reports. The generals that came before Grant were very much aware of their public image, and in the case of George McClellan, also eying a run for the Presidency. Their tendency to advance cautiously and then immediately retreat after any battle that did not result in complete victory ultimately wasted more lives for little gain. Still, to this day Grant is often cited as waging a pure war of attrition, carelessly throwing his men into combat to grind down the Confederates.
</li><li> Pope Pius XII, also known as "Hitler's Pope" for a long time for his refusal to stand against the Nazis and the Holocaust, was vilified as the absolute worst pope who ever existed in History. Turns out it was strategic all along since he used his power to decide who was or wasn't Catholic to help thousands of Jews escape Nazi territories by giving away travel visas, and none of them knew who their savior was until decades later. Actually standing against the Nazis openly would have been a very bad idea since Hitler had the power to control frontiers and could have added Catholics to his no-travel list, making the whole operation all but impossible. Pius XII knew very well that his reputation would suffer, but he didn't mind since even the Bible says that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">doing the right thing</a> is more important than maintaining a reputation.
