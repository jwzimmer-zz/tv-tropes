A little shepherd boy cries wolf to get people to come running because he's bored out of his skull (or whatever). They fall for it. He does it again. They fall for it again. Then, an actual wolf comes along, and the little boy screams his little lungs out (crying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToBelieveMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToBelieveMe">You Have to Believe Me!</a>") but this time nobody comes, since they think he's just playing that stupid prank again. The sheep the boy is watching get nommed down, and the boy learns a valuable lesson. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grimmification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grimmification">Grimmer</a> versions will end with the wolf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">eating the boy</a> as well.

</p><p>Some have the variant plot of the hero kid getting caught in a relatively minor lie, or at least they thought they have, and then the kid alone spots something truly serious and no-one believes him. Fortunately, the kid is either able to find witnesses to support him or is able to prove his claim, even if he has to save the day on his own. Eventually, the kid's reputation is restored either by the authorities being impressed by his heroism or the people he helped coming forward to praise his character.

This can be taken two ways: "Don't be a liar" or "Don't assume liars are <em>always</em> lying." Less traditional possibilities are "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight">Never tell the same lie twice</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">Don't leave a known liar on watch.</a>"
</p><p>There is also a more innocent variant when a hero, like a detective, makes a conclusion and decides that he has to take immediate action with something, only to find he was mistaken to his embarrassment. This kills his credibility with others, which makes his next move upon learning the real situation all the more difficult.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdPanic">Crowd Panic</a>: As in another unspoken Aesop of the tale; "don't agitate then laugh at the village — it gets really cranky".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">The Gadfly</a>: The boy gets people riled up by screaming about danger that doesn't exist.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a>: Let's face it, the lad earns this typical fairy tale ending. Depending on the version, either he dies or his sheep die because of his lying.

<ul><li> Usopp's introductory arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is modeled on the Boy Who Cried Wolf (or Pirates, in his case), and his name is a portmanteau of "Uso" (lie) and "Aesop". By the point we meet him, he's done it every day <em>for ten years</em>. By then, the village sets their watches by it ("Usopp's coming, time to go to work.").
<ul><li> It becomes heartwarmingly inverted at the climax of the arc when Usopp resolves to handle an actual pirate attack by himself (with help from the protagonists) because he cares more about the villagers' peace of mind than restoring his credibility. When he decides to join Luffy's crew, his friends take up the "Pirates are coming!" chant every day in his honor. The village actually finds it sweet because they miss Usopp.
</li></ul></li><li> Minor instance with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, where Konata can't convince her teacher she's too sick to attend class after she spent the past two days giving other (dumber) excuses.
</li><li> The opposite is played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>. After some incidents on April Fool's Day, Itoshiki concludes that if a person is always honest everyone will believe them even when they're lying. Then a fairy tale book is shown with the opposite of the "Boy Who Cried Wolf" story, where an entire village is destroyed after a perfectly honest boy cries wolf as a joke.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> uses a variant of this in <em>R2</em>. During the Second Battle of Tokyo, Suzaku says <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's carrying a Weapon of Mass Destruction</span> in an attempt to deter the Black Knights. Lelouch doesn't believe him because a couple of episodes earlier, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suzaku lied about a private meeting and brought along soldiers who nearly captured Lelouch.</span>...except that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suzaku <em>did</em> come alone; Schneizel was the one who sent the soldiers, to destroy any remaining bonds of trust between the pair.</span> This results in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tokyo getting destroyed.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em>, Yurippe told this story (lies repeated make them less believable) and her new alternative is to use different people and invent new gags. The gags used are: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hinata - bamboo shoots shooting out the ground (Hinata's chair launches), Takamatsu - look thinner on the clothes (Takamatsu's chair launches with style), Ooyama - confess to Tenshi (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Hinata</a>'s chair launches). The plan behind these outlandish ruses is to distract Kanade "Angel" Tachibana while one of Yurippe's accomplices switches her test with a fake answer sheet, causing Kanade to fail her exams and be removed from her position as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>.</span>
</li><li> This also shows up in an episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleLulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleLulu">Little Lulu</a></em> anime. After three false alarms involving falling out of a tree, freaking out over a caterpillar, and thinking that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Alvin</a> was going to fall into the lake while rolling in a barrel, Lulu is no longer believed by Tubby and the other boys when she tries telling them that the Westside Gang really did show up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Up until the end of the episode, that is</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> is able to exploit this trope in a manga chapter and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket">Lupin III (Green Jacket)</a></em> episode ("<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LupinIIIS1E4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LupinIIIS1E4">One Chance to Breakout</a>") based on that chapter, by intentionally causing this effect. While he's in prison, he keeps claiming that he isn't really Lupin, until everyone gets sick of it and stops listening. On the day of his execution, he switches places with a guard, who gets dragged off protesting that he isn't Lupin  and, of course, no one believes him.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> movie, Ryoko is the most hostile to Mayuka when she appears at the Masaki household. When Ryoko finds out that Mayuka might really be a threat to Tenchi, Ryoko tries to warn the others, only for Tenchi to brush her off, thinking Ryoko is overreacting again.
</li><li> In a filler episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, a little girl named Lime would constantly scare her small town by screaming that Cell was coming. Ironically, the real Cell never shows up, but Gohan and her grandfather scold her for it.

However, after Clover notices a leaf that appears to be a trap, they go for plan B by using a stone that turns the duo into wolves. Clover and Kale listen to their plans until they see a cave that contained missing berries. As the episode goes on, more stuff from the citizens of Crescent Forest starts disappearing. Cinnamon and Twirl once again run back to Clover and the rest of the citizens, only for Clover and Professor Hoot to say that they are both lying. Near the end of the episode, Kale notices a moving box covered in sheets that is later revealed to be his baby brothers. His brothers then reveal that there actually is a wolf inside the box. The wolf explains to the citizens that he got injured by a falling tree and Kale's brothers decided to help him recover by taking various things to help him heal including food and temporary shelter.

The whole event culminates with him going out on an upper-floor balcony while everyone waves and shouts at him, and prepares to make a speech... and only then realizes <em>the room behind him is on fire.</em> The fireman who rescues him even asks him why he didn't evacuate like a smart person should.

<ul><li> Likewise, when he tries to get Hurley to come with him next season, having joined forces with Jack to take the survivors back to the island, Hurley refuses to listen.
</li><li> Also, in season six, when Ben finds an injured Sun in the jungle, the others refuse to believe he had nothing to do with it, even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he had switched sides at that point</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>:
<ul><li> Klinger lies repeatedly about family emergencies that require him to be sent home. When he receives word in the mail that his wife wants a divorce, nobody believes it's for real.
</li><li> Klinger also fakes illness or injury on several occasions in hopes of getting a medical discharge from the Army. In "The Red/White Blues," he has a bad reaction to an anti-malarial drug and develops anemia. The medical staff initially ignore his symptoms, thinking this is just another of his pretend afflictions - until another soldier comes down with the same symptoms.
</li><li> This also happened in the episode when Klinger lost his hearing. The doctors were skeptical when he claimed their lips were moving but no sound was coming out. They realized he was telling the truth when BJ stood behind him and crashed two bedpans together, and he didn't flinch at all.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits">Misfits</a></em>, we have a rare case of a character crying wolf both metaphorically and <em>literally</em>. Nathan is convinced that his step-father is a werewolf — and not without reason — but unfortunately his mother, Louise, is so used to her son attempting to sabotage her relationships (and generally spouting fantastical lies at the drop of a hat) that she sternly refuses to listen.
<div class="indent"><strong>Louise:</strong> This is like the time you said Richard was sexually abusing you. <br/><strong>Nathan:</strong> It's nothing like that! <em>This is true!</em>
</div><ul><li> This trope is actually played with quite a lot in <em>Misfits</em>, and not merely with Nathan and his various lies. As the protagonists are all convicted petty criminals, when they find themselves committing horrible acts through necessity (they are forced to kill an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> guy in self-defence), they know that no-one would believe them if they told the truth — which is understandable, the truth being that they were caught in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything">freak electrical storm</a> that gave them all superpowers and transformed their supervisor into a psychotic zombie. Hence they are given little choice but to lie.

With insurance believing that Kirk might have been lying about the robbery, Kirk has to take a lie detector test... which ends up not showing any results when used on Kirk. When it looks like Kirk won't get the insurance money, Dick tells Kirk that the whole situation was his fault for lying so many times before, comparing it to "The Boy Who Creid Wolf", a story that Kirk had never heard (and as Dick tells the story everyone else mentions hearing different versions). Of course, in this episode, the robbery happens off-camera, so the viewer has to decide that Kirk is actually telling the truth this time.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive">One Life to Live</a></em>, promiscuous troublemaker Marty Saybrooke spread false rumors that the town reverend had molested a local teen (out of revenge for him rebuffing her advances). A year later, when Marty was gang-raped, the DA warned her that many would see her accusations as an example of this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em> had an episode where a kid named Patrick constantly made up stories to his friends, the latest of which was being bitten by a giant bear and having a (fake) scar to prove it. So naturally when he runs into a bunch of alien creatures who are disguising themselves as humans and tries to get help, nobody believes him (except the Rangers, who know he's telling the truth and are looking for said creatures).
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice">The Practice</a></em>, Jimmy defended an accused rapist whose victim had a record for claiming to have been raped in two previous occasions only to have the authorities investigate and find no evidence to confirm either case. That record makes Jimmy believe his client's claim that the "victim" consented. However, the law prohibits defense from bringing up the victim's sexual life in rape cases. Jimmy even tried (and failed) to convince the judge to allow it. While trying, Jimmy literally accused the "victim" of crying wolf. In another episode, Hannah Rose discredit a rape victim by pointing out said victim had been diagnosed with Münchausen.

Number Six discovers an assassination plot against Number Two and tries to deliver a warning (to prevent reprisals from striking The Village). However, Number Two has been given a fake recording of Number Six delivering a number of such warnings in the past and dismisses Number Six as a paranoid crank.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em>, Shawn alone believes the testimony of a man who's known to be a chronic liar, because he can read the man's "tells" that reveal he's not lying this time. He spends the rest of the episode trying to prove the man's case.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon">Sanford and Son</a></em>, as well as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">revival</a> series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanford">Sanford</a></em>, Fred's fake "heart attacks" were a running gag. An episode of the latter show starts out with him complaining about feeling sick and having numbness in his arm, but the other characters blow it off as the usual goldbricking; after they've left, however, he suffers a <em>real</em> heart attack and they come back to find him collapsed on the floor.
<ul><li> Years later, this would become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> when <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReddFoxx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReddFoxx">Redd Foxx</a> had a heart attack on the set of his new series <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRoyalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRoyalFamily">The Royal Family</a></em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">which had a working title of</a> <em>Chest Pains</em>). Many in the cast initially thought Foxx was reprising his <em>Sanford</em> schtick, though they did summon help post haste.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> does this a lot, usually involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">the Janitor</a>:
<ul><li> One episode involves him planning an elaborate prank on J.D., who is living in a tent on his half-acre. The Janitor calls the police from a nearby payphone for several days, reporting a wolf. When the police arrive and ask J.D., there is no wolf. The plan culminates in the Janitor releasing an actual wolf in JD's tent, only to have the wolf turn on Janitor instead.
</li><li> Played fairly straight in an episode where the Janitor claims to have been a world-class hurdler in his younger days. J.D., who had been victimized by the Janitor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">compulsive lying</a> for years, finally cries foul and tells him that the hurdling bit is a bridge too far. J.D. finds out later that the Janitor was actually telling the truth this time.
<ul><li> Same when the Janitor tries to prove that he's not a loner and is seeing someone. When J.D. prompts for her name, the Janitor seemingly struggles and blurts out "Lady". Naturally, J.D. thinks he's proven the Janitor is lying yet again, only for a woman named Lady to show up and kiss the Janitor. They later marry.
</li></ul></li><li> Yet another time, the Janitor offers an apology and tickets to a sporting event as a way to make amends, and J.D., having been tricked by this sort of thing before, denies him. The Janitor then turns, pulls the tickets out of his pocket, and says "Fine, see if I ever reach out again."
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Shoestring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Shoestring">Shoestring</a></em> episode "Stamp Duty", Eddie's acquaintance from the psychiatric ward calls the station, saying he witnessed a murder. Eddie doesn't believe him, since he's a pathological liar who makes up a different crime every week, even though he's telling the truth this time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:

When Bashir tells the story to Garak, the Cardassian (coming from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Planet of Hats</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastards</a>) concludes the moral is not to keep telling the <em>same</em> lie. The problem with that interpretation is, if the boy was exposed for repeatedly starting false alarms, they still would have stopped believing him no matter how many different stories he had told. Which is exactly the problem for Garak — in the same episode it's apparent that someone is out to kill Garak when a bomb goes off in his tailor shop. Odo tracks down the assassin but realises that Garak set off the bomb himself so people would believe him when he said his life was in danger, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">Consummate Liar</a>.

When Jeremy tells him his train is on fire, James doesn't believe him; the fire was on the side he couldn't see and Jeremy isn't the most trustworthy co-presenter around. As a result, the buffet car burns down completely and all the passengers James is carrying run away.

After they let him go he tells his friends about the experience, and of course they don't believe him.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltraSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltraSeven">Ultraseven</a></em> was titled "The Boy Who Cried Flying Saucer". In it, a stargazer spots a huge fleet of flying saucers heading for Earth and is goaded by the alien behind the invasion to report his sighting to Ultra Garrison, only for the team to check their telescopes and find nothing each time (the alien even claims "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" to be the inspiration for the scheme). However, the alien's plan ends up backfiring when UG learns about the stargazer rats on him and they finally get a photograph of the saucer fleet.

</li><li> In another sketch, Ernie finds a piece of cake and eats it. Bert then informs Ernie that he bought two pieces of cake for them to have for dessert, before seeing that one piece is missing. Rather than admit his mistake, Ernie tells Bert that a monster ate the cake, and when Bert questions why Ernie has a fork in his hand and is wearing a napkin, claims that the monster did it to frame him. Bert doesn't believe him, figures out that Ernie ate the cake, and only sarcastically agrees that it could have happened. But when Bert leaves, Beautiful Day Monster shows up, eats the other piece of cake, and for some reason asks Ernie to hold the fork and napkin. Bert comes back and notices the other piece missing, and when Ernie starts telling Bert what happened, Bert immediately doesn't believe him.

Unlike most of the other examples, though, Gonzo is not deliberately lying; he's just over-excitable and jumps to conclusions a lot, his imagination well-helped along by overreacting sheep who panic over everything (a couple of falling rocks means an earthquake, a few drops of water hitting him is obviously the signs of a tidal wave). He honestly believes it every time he rushes to warn the villagers of impending doom, but since the disasters are always ludicrous and never even remotely true, the result is the same: When the Big Bad Wolf shows up, the villagers don't bother to listen to Gonzo's cries for help.
<ul><li> It becomes a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> when the moral weirdly enough remains "don't lie" and the villagers all chew Gonzo out for lying — except Gonzo <em>never tells a single intentional lie over the course of the story.</em> A better moral for this version of the tale would have been "before making public statements about something, try to make sure you have the basic facts right and haven't misunderstood the entire thing."
</li><li> Which might be interpreted more along the lines of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSkyIsFalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSkyIsFalling">The Sky Is Falling</a>" than of deliberate pranking.

Until it declared 5+ civilian casualties, at which point a squad was deployed and discovered that it was telling the truth for once.

Because of this, running into a page that actually <em>is</em> either permanently locked, suffering from the more crippling version of the bug, or temporarily locked because another user is currently working on it can come as a surprise.
</li><li> On the Discord app, due to how easily the @everyone feature can be abused — allowing one member to notify everyone on the server, regardless of reason — many users mute notifications on all servers they're a part of. This makes them susceptible to missing announcements that would actually be important to them, such as security issues and major updates. Over time, it becomes increasingly obvious to staff members which members have muted the server if they haven't updated their roles along with everyone else...

Nose Marie even once told him "If you were Pinocchio, your nose would stretch from here Kalamazoo."
<ul><li> In "Whopper Cries Uncle", the puppies' year supply of dog food suddenly disappears. Whopper asks his uncle JR Whopper, who's a Texas tycoon, to visit so the pound could borrow money for food, but lied to his uncle, saying he's "a zillionaire, live in a mansion, and own the puppy pound." So the pups use the evil dog-hating Katrinia's home to fool JR. When Katrina arrives, the pups hide in a closet and Whopper comes clean to his uncle about not being rich (though the way he confessed caused Nose Marie to say "He even sounds like he's fibbin' when he's telling the truth"). JR Whopper, luckily, wasn't upset. Apparently, lying runs in Whopper's family because JR wasn't rich (he wasn't even from Texas) and was just a flat-broke dog hoping to get money from Whopper.

<ul><li> The technical term for this phenomenon is "Alarm Fatigue", where constant exposure to false (or inconsequential) alarms desensitizes people to them and makes them more likely to ignore actual emergency alarms or react to them much slower than they should.
</li><li> The "Particularly Dangerous Situation" and "Tornado Emergency" enhanced verbiage/warning came into existence precisely because of this. In most places where severe storms are frequent (e.g. the Midwest and South in the US), tornado <em>watches</em> are often ignored entirely, and due to the old way of issuing tornado warnings by county rather than by locations at risk, people got into the habit of even ignoring tornado <em>warnings</em> unless they saw it for themselves - often leading to lots of deaths and injuries from tornadoes, especially at night. To get around this, "particularly dangerous situation" verbiage is now used for watches when a tornado outbreak is expected in the watch area, and a "Tornado Emergency" is declared for actual urbanized/heavily populated areas in the path of a confirmed via ground truth or debris echoes tornado. These seem to be working to emphasize danger for now, but there's always the potential for these, too, to eventually be seen as Crying Wolf...
</li><li> Similar to the car alarm example, store staff will frequently disregard the beeping of electronic article surveillance systems because these alarms often go off accidentally. Makes you wonder how many shoplifters set off an alarm and still walk out of the store without getting caught.
<ul><li> On the other hand, many store employees not trained to handle shoplifters will be told not to engage any one that actually is one (i.e. anyone that doesn't immediately stop when the alarm goes off). In no small part due to the potential for untrained employees getting hurt by someone desperate enough to snatch and grab. The employees trained to handle that sort of thing generally are not the obvious ones and most are caught on camera any way at which point they're much easier to catch if they come back (or for severe offenders, elsewhere as stores will typically share information about such people as it hurts everyone in the area).

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GGAllin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GGAllin">GG Allin</a> would have friends call his brother (who was also in the band) and say that GG died, which is nothing compared to his onstage antics (throwing his shit into the audience, bashing his head in with a microphone, beating up audience members, et cetera). Eventually, he got used to it, so he ignored all calls like that. When GG Allin died of a drug overdose, band members, friends, and others called him to say that he died. Guess what happened?
</li><li> A few years after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a>' infamous radio dramatization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em> (which was made as a radio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary">Mockumentary</a> and actually tricked a large number of people into thinking Martians had really invaded) he was doing a patriotic radio show featuring music and poetry that was then interrupted with the news that the Japanese had just attacked Pearl Harbor. Nobody believed it.
</li><li> Forcefully averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> by many high-security areas (prisons, army bases, top-secret labs, and so forth) when all alarms are always answered, even when it seems to be just another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsProbablyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsProbablyNothing">false alarm</a> as its always a possibility that the <em>false alarms</em> may be engineered by intruders hoping to exploit the crying-wolf syndrome in the hopes of breaking in without too much resistance.
</li><li> This is precisely why today, joking that you have a bomb isn't a good thing to do. Not only will you be detained, you can be outright <em>arrested</em>.
<ul><li> This is also a similar case for guns. Joking in a public place like a movie theater or a school that you have a gun or are going to get a gun can cause the entire area to be under lockdown and you'll be subjected to heavy investigations just to be sure whether or not you were serious. Case in point: a violinist traveling to Chicago made a joke about having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessViolins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessViolins">machine gun in his case</a>. Airport security did NOT have a sense of humour, but deliberately so. He missed the flight.
</li><li> In fact, US Supreme Court judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., defined the limits of free speech in <em>Schenck vs United States</em> as "falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic".
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, both sides spread propaganda about the enemy, which included a genocide perpetrated by the Germans. While there were indeed occasional war crimes against the civilian population (what with the western front being most of the time in Belgium and France), but genocide... less so. This came to light after the war, of course. Now, if you have been paying attention during history lessons, you might remember that Germany did indeed start a program of genocide within the next 20 years. The response to warnings this time was rather... lukewarm. Ouch.
<ul><li> Anne Frank and her family knew <em>from British radio</em> that if they were captured things would be bad, yet the soldiers liberating the camps were utterly surprised/horrified.
</li><li> The Germans actually did commit a genocide shortly before WWI broke out, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Namaqua_genocide">Herero and Namaqua genocide<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in German South-West Africa (modern-day Namibia).
</li><li> Highly disputed. German planning did in fact provide for long-term ethnic cleansing (by deportation if possible, by outright slaughter if not), and that is what they did to varying degrees in pretty much every country they occupied. And even when they chose to cut back on willy-nilly killing, they were entirely willing to use famine and forced labor in any event. If anything, the main fault with the propaganda was not in creating a genocide where there was not one but in exaggerating the scope of the existing ones.
</li><li> Interestingly, the first professional Holocaust deniers were not neo-Nazis, but liberal pacifists like Harry Elmer Barnes and Paul Rassinier. They remembered the lurid anti-German propaganda of World War I and thought this "Holocaust" thing was just the same old war-justifying lie. Unfortunately, their efforts laid the groundwork for Holocaust deniers with very different politics.
</li><li> The more conventional neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers also like to bring up World War I propaganda in order to argue, "They lied the first time, so maybe they lied the second time too." In fact, the original Nazis liked to make this argument when they were in power. Prior to the war, Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath dismissed claims of Nazi wrongdoing by saying, "One would really think that the foreign public, which meanwhile realized the untruth of the World War atrocity stories, would not so easily again be deceived by a new dishing-up of similar fairy tales."
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">The Crusades</a> got off to a <em>very</em> ignoble start with <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Crusade">"The People's Crusade,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which failed so horribly that Kilij Arslan, the Seljuq Sultan of Rûm, was convinced that every future attempt would be similarly disorganized, and was thus nothing to worry about. This miscalculation allowed the <em>much</em> better-organized and better-equipped Baron's Crusade to gain footholds in the country nearly unopposed and, eventually, Jerusalem itself.
</li><li> "This is not a practice alert. I repeat, this is not a practice alert!"
</li><li> In a Midwest town, the tornado warning sirens are tested on the first Tuesday of each month during tornado season. Jokes that tornadoes better not strike on a first Tuesday are so old, even the weather reports seldom do them anymore.
<ul><li> In another hometown, they test the sirens on the first Wednesday of every month, <em>as long as the weather is clear.</em> If the weather is cloudy, they wait a day, and so on until a clear day.
</li><li> One town even tests them once a week on <em>Saturday</em> at <em>noon</em>. You know, the time when everyone is out of the house, at the park or lake.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, the media agitation over the possible end of oil reserves during the record prices attained in the summer of 2008 flopped during the first months of 2009, when crude oil prices dropped sharply. (In practice, the oil reserves of all major countries <strong>increased</strong> in 2010-2011 due to the drilling campaign bringing huge untapped reserves into the market.)
</li><li> Workplaces and schools which conduct regular fire drills can result in people becoming complacent when there really <em>is</em> a fire and the alarm rings. In schools, alarms are often pulled as pranks, too.
<ul><li> This can be a good thing: it ensures that nobody panics and treats the threat as a routine incident, so everybody can exit the building in a safe and orderly manner.
<ul><li> Unfortunately, this was exploited in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting#Shooting">Stoneman-Douglas shooting in 2018,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as the shooter pulled a fire alarm in order to have more targets.
</li><li> Unless there's a really big problem, like a teacher assuming it's another fire drill, when in fact it's a <em>tornado drill.</em> (It happened.)
</li></ul></li><li> On a related note, a dormitory at Seton Hall University had a problem with idiots setting off the fire alarms as a joke. This happened repeatedly over a matter of months and caused many students to ignore the alarms and not evacuate the building when a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boland_Hall_fire">real fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> started.
</li></ul></li><li> Starblade, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">Furry</a> who made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"Fuck you! I'm a dragon!"</a> a household phrase among /b/tards, often asserted that the backlash to his behavior on the Internet constituted death threats. Since the general consensus was that every other sentence he typed was A) totally hilarious and B) in itself evidence for a need of stronger medication, most Internet denizens dismissed claims that someone was trying to kill him as standard Starblade fare. It became a little harder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">to classify his claims as paranoia when his friend stabbed him to death.</a>
</li><li> King You of Zhou, a Chinese monarch who reigned in the 8th Century BC, had a favorite concubine named Bao Si whom he later made his queen, but he could not get her to so much as crack a smile. One night he had the bright idea to light the kingdom's signal fires, and the resulting confusion, with so many men and horses running around in disorder, made Bao Si break into laughter. This made his wife happy but cost King You the trust of his nobles, and after repeated abuse of the warning system, there was an actual invasion. When the monarch lit the beacons again they were ignored, and that's why King You was the last of the Western Zhou.

The poster got told that her cousin would say he's allergic to foods to get out of eating them. This, of course, leads to her making him eat something he's allergic to.
<ul><li> One commenter claims that the cousin wouldn't have said he's allergic if the poster had been a better cook.
</li></ul></li><li> During the <em>Apollo 13</em> mission, astronaut Fred Haise turned a valve in the Lunar Module that produced a loud bang, as per a joke. So when the accident occurred and produced a similar bang, the other astronauts Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert initially didn't think anything about it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime">until they saw Haise's concerned face</a>.
</li><li> Groups like <em>DARE</em>, and to a lesser extent the U.S. education system in general, have been known to lie about the effects of milder illegal drugs like marijuana, causing many to take less seriously their warnings about more significantly dangerous drugs like heroin and meth. This has led many to give them a fair bit of the blame for the high rates of use of hard drugs. John Cheese of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em>, for example, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-bits-advice-that-dont-make-sense-until-its-too-late_p2/">had this to say:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<div class="indent">You spend years in school listening to D.A.R.E. programs (or whatever anti-drug stuff they do where you live) telling you that one hit off a joint will put you in a coma. Then you actually try the stuff and realize that's bullshit, so you immediately ignore all other warnings, too.
</div></li><li> Political pundits often say things like "this is the most important election in our nation's history, and if [candidate] wins, this country will be DOOMED!!". It starts to wear a little thin when you realize that they say this <em>every single election</em>. They do a similar thing pushing how dramatic and close it is, even if it's so obviously in the bag the eventual winner barely pays attention to it at all.
</li><li> Similarly, various news agencies try to get higher ratings by labeling <strong>everything</strong> as some form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScandalGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScandalGate">Scandal Gate</a>, which inherently devalues the impact such scandals should carry.
</li><li> Dialing 911 (or any other emergency number) and making up a bogus emergency situation or not answering the dispatcher is a good way to get yourself arrested and/or fined. Emergency dispatchers are trained to send out police officers to anyone that calls them (if one is requested) or calls and immediately hangs up<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0y227');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0y227" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0y227');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The logic here being that the person calling may have been cut off by (say) a kidnapper who discovered them trying to call the police, or the caller was forced to hang up <em>before</em> they were discovered in such a manner</span>. Thanks to the advancement of technology, you can easily be tracked down if you try to prank the emergency dispatcher. All that said, there <em>have</em> been instances of bad 911 operators treating a seemingly disbelievable 911 call as if it was a prank when it actually wasn't.
<ul><li> In the late 2010s, there were some <a class="urllink" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/07/18/bbq-becky-permit-patty-and-why-internet-shaming-white-people-who-police-black-people/793574002/">particularly controversial instances<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of this where social class and race intersected, most notably "BBQ Becky" and "Permit Patty". Every instance had been captured on phone camera, which was becoming more common due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoingMobile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GoingMobile">falling prices of smartphones</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">faking surrender</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingPossum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingPossum">injury, or death</a> are all forbidden by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">The Laws and Customs of War</a>. Being shot at by "surrendering" enemies tends to discourage soldiers from accepting genuine surrenders, and being ambushed by "corpses" similarly leads to them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeSureHesDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeSureHesDead">making sure</a> that any dead bodies they come across are, in fact, dead (which, it bears mention, is <em>also</em> illegal).
</li><li> Claims of police brutality are becoming so incredibly common these days that it's getting hard for anyone, including the most professional internal affairs investigators, to distinguish between the mountains of disgruntled and self-entitled traffic stop "victims" and actual cases of brutality. It is especially common on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> to have videos of people open-carrying firearms, which is perfectly legal in many places but then approaching random officers of the law just to start an incident, thus tricking the cop into getting confrontational and aggressive. Once they get home they then upload said video to prove that the police are violent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">usually after editing out their harassment of the cop in question so it looks like said cop is being aggressive and confrontational for no reason</a>.
<ul><li> Police responses to claims of brutality are also subject to this as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">Minority citizens have complained about police brutality for decades to no avail</a>, and it is only with the rise of social media and cellphones that more and more cases of police brutality are becoming known to the public. Officers commonly falsify their reports and the police use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a> as often, if not more than the claimants themselves. A number of incidents of the police releasing edited footage when just about everyone has a camera these days and can post unedited footage on the internet has damaged police credibility in the public eye.
</li><li> This is part of why shoulder-mounted cameras on officers is gaining traction, as the logic is that it would protect good cops from this sort of harassment while outing bad and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCops">Corrupt Cops</a> for their behavior. Some locations that have integrated body cameras have seen drastic reduction in the number of civilian complaints, while other locations have remained relatively stable. On the other hand, many juries seem reluctant to convict officers even when what would otherwise seem to be clear video camera evidence is used.
</li></ul></li><li> Fire safety regulations often recommend installing smoke alarms in every room <em>except</em> a kitchen, even though the presence of lots of high-powered electrical equipment (oven/stove, toaster, water heater...) there makes it a very common place of where fires start. The reason for this is that smoke detectors can't tell the difference between smoke from burnt food and smoke from an actual fire nor the difference between smoke and steam for that matter, which would lead to frequent false alarms which in turn can lead to people ignoring a real alarm.
</li><li> Back in the 1990s, in a lot of divorce cases there were parents fighting for custody who falsely accused the other parents of child molestation. Sometimes, they coached their kids to go along with it. As a result, many judges simply don't want to hear accusations of child sex abuse. Some studies have even suggested that nowadays, a parent who accuses the other parent of abuse may be <em>less</em> likely to get custody than if they said nothing at all, which...leads to problems of its own.
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CenkUygur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CenkUygur">Cenk Uygur</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/cenkuygur/statuses/373524887823859712">points out,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the history of the United States on military interventions has undermined its credibility on them.
</li><li> As a bitter (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianHumour">of course</a>) post-Soviet half-joke puts it: "Everything they told us about Socialism was a lie. Only too late did we realise that everything they told us about Capitalism was <em>not</em>."
</li><li> Thanks to gluten-free diets becoming a fad, people who actually have celiac disease have trouble being taken seriously by restaurant staff, leading to things like not paying attention to cross-contamination. For example, you can't just pull a hamburger patty off a bun, as it can still have bits of the bun stuck to it.
<ul><li> Similarly, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability">Obfuscating Disability</a>, this trope has led to a lot of those with disabilities not being taken seriously, accused of faking, or even being subject to violent attacks. A particular case of this is the subject of ESAs vs service animals, because of a combo of factors (mostly tied to legalities <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1wv0r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1wv0r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1wv0r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A bit more on this is because 1) the Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't allow for someone to ask for credentials to prove it and 2), some states treat the two as the same</span>), SA handlers (or trainers) have been accused faking so they can have an excuse to bring their animal into public or get past housing rules.

</li><li> For a few years, the Cambodian genocide was dismissed by many people, mostly leftist intellectuals, as over-the-top anti-communist propaganda. This came shortly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, during which the U.S. government had told fairly transparent lies to justify its military actions. Unfortunately, it turned out the Cambodian genocide was very real.
</li><li> Through either alarm fatigue or the pilots deliberately disabling alarms to stop them from making that godforsaken noise every time they take off or land, nuisance warnings on aircraft kill.
<ul><li> An aircraft warning system known as TAWS warns the pilot if they are coming dangerously close to an obstacle or ground. It has a database of major airports, so it won't generate a false alarm when the aircraft is approaching the ground in order to land. However, the pilots from Polish 36th Special Aviation Regiment - responsible for carrying VIPs, including the President, on the international flights - were very often landing at various Eastern Europe airfields not in the database (e.g. many rural military or ex-military airports) and, with the TAWS invariably going off every time during landing, they developed a habit of ignoring it (or even resetting the altimeter to silence the alarm). Thus, during a VIP flight to a rural military airport, as the TAWS sounded once again, the pilots ignored it... cue a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> when they suddenly saw <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu-154_crash">the trees looming out of the dense fog right in front of them.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Air traffic control in the San Diego area had an automated system that was supposed to prevent mid-air collisions by sounding an alarm when there were two planes on a collision course. There was one problem with the system: it issued so many false alarms that air traffic controllers ignored it. Then on the morning of Sept. 25, 1978, the alarm went off warning that a PSA 727 was going to collide with a small Cessna. The controller on duty ignored the alarm only to discover to his horror <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSA_Flight_182">it was for real after the two planes collided.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The MD-80's take-off configuration warning system had a tendency to give false alarms during taxiing resulting in pilots of MD-80s routinely disabling the alarm which resulted in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_255">what was then the second deadliest airline accident in US History.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Similar to the example above, due to Air Inter pilots routinely flying their planes faster than normal, the ground proximity alarm had a tendency to go off a lot resulting in the airline disabling the alarm on all their planes <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Inter_Flight_148">with predictable results.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> This was also a major factor in the crash of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroper&lt;!--C3--&gt;BA_Flight_603">an Aeroperu flight<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1996. Shortly after takeoff, their instruments started going haywire, causing a series of alarms, some directly contradicting each other, to sound off in the cockpit all at once.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28m7f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note28m7f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28m7f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was eventually determined that the ports that feed information to the instruments were blocked, so the instruments were getting a bunch of inaccurate and nonsensical data.</span> So when the pilots heard the ground proximity warning system, they assumed it was another malfunction. The GPWS was actually one of the few systems that was working, trying to warn them they were flying dangerously low. They didn't realize the truth until the plane's wing actually struck water, by which point it was too late for them to avert the accident.
</li></ul></li><li> This was a major factor in the 1988 <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_de_Lyon_rail_accident">Gare de Lyon rail accident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Trains at the time were known to have a problem where if the emergency stop was activated, the brake lines would develop a condition known as an "air lock" where they would become overloaded and not release, requiring the driver and conductor to manually release air from the braking system, so when the driver of a commuter train found that his train would not move after he reset the emergency brake, he assumed this was the problem and acted accordingly. In reality, while resetting the emergency brake, he had inadvertently also closed a valve that disabled the brakes on all but the first car, triggering a safety mechanism that would lock the brakes to prevent a train from moving without sufficient braking power. By responding to the problem he thought he had (an air lock), he inadvertently disabled a failsafe and started the train with insufficient braking power. (Contributing to the problem was the fact that there were no additional signs to indicate it was a more serious problem; the train was not equipped with a warning to alert the driver that the brake valve was closed, and even the brake pressure gauge erroneously indicated that everything was normal.)
</li><li> Ironically, dogs can fall under this trope if they have a barking problem. If they have a tendency to bark for inconsequential reasons, then their owners won't take their barking seriously when a <em>real</em> emergency arises.
</li><li> Dyslexia and/or ADHD. Both of those, depending on the country, can result in several bonuses during education (eg. more time given to complete a written test, or relaxed rules considering behavior during classes). When both became known to the general public somewhere in the late 1990s/early 2000s, the schools around the world noted a serious influx of suddenly diagnosed cases of both, thanks to "protective" parents trying to get their kids through school years in an easier way (and the "helpful" doctors as well); as a result, nowadays a number of schools treat any claim that your child is dyslexic or suffers from ADHD as a cheating attempt and refuse any special treatment of such children.
</li><li> California Proposition 65 mandates that any and all consumer products that contain possible carcinogens must be labelled with a warning (i.e. the famous "This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm"). However the low bar for labeling something a carcinogen meant that almost <em>everything</em> sold in California is labelled with the warning. Many pollution activists have criticized the system because these labels are so ubiquitous that no one actually pays attention to them.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> presenters and crew were almost lynched in Argentina because some Argentinians thought that a license plate H982 FKL was a reference to the 1982 Falkland war. It was most likely a coincidence but not many people believed that.

</li><li> Abe Vigoda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportsOfMyDeathWereGreatlyExaggerated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReportsOfMyDeathWereGreatlyExaggerated">had been erroneously reported as dead twice before in 1982 and 1987</a>, so when he died for real on January 26, 2016, many reports had to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer">"This is not a hoax."</a>
</li><li> Go ask any South Korean person (or, heck, even any American person) what their thoughts on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's rhetoric about nuking the world are, and most (but not all, mind you) will point to this trope. The NK have been using this rhetoric for more than a decade but has yet to deal any sort of significant damage to anything but its own reputation (even China, who sided with them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">during the war</a> and is essentially the primary reason NATO hasn't performed a preemptive strike, is getting tired of the posturing). If an invasion actually happens it will be a big deal, but for the time being no one, especially the people of South Korea, could care less about how much the North <strong>says</strong> they'll do it.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathOfWCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathOfWCW">The Death of WCW</a></em>, the sale of the wrestling promotion company was treated as this by many wrestlers. The management team did so many shoots, swerves, and works to throw <em>everyone</em> off-balance that when they were told that they were being sold they didn't believe it until they didn't get their paychecks.
</li><li> Turns out, your own body might even be prone to this. A few years back, scientists conducted studies that supported the idea that excessively consuming artificial sweeteners will make your body less likely to respond to sweet tastes by producing insulin, which makes it all the more worse when you consume actual sugars.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3sluk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3sluk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3sluk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Just to be clear, high-fructose corn syrup is a type of sugar, not an artificial sweetener so that you don't misinterpret which side of the problem it falls on.</span>
</li><li> Colds, allergies, or other common illnesses are usually treatable with over the counter medicines or home remedies, but they take time to work. Because common sicknesses are, well, common, it's very easy to dismiss them when they linger too long or occur at a time of year when they <em>shouldn't</em> appear. A lot of the more serious illnesses like the flu can be deadly if not treated early and many people have died from ignoring symptoms they thought they could just brush off or treat with common medicine and wait for them to go away on their own.
</li><li> A rather odd aversion: there have been (and continue to be) innumerable cult leaders and the like who have said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> is going to happen on (insert some date that has come and gone with nothing happening). Considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">they've all predicted wrong before</a>, you'd <em>think</em> people would greet such claims more skeptically, unfortunately...
</li><li> Throughout 2017 - 2020, the former Labour Party leader in Britain, as well as the party itself (which had moved away from the centrist right and taken a more left-of-centre stance) was dogged by accusations of institutional anti-semitism and the repeated assertion that the party itself had become anti-semitic. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">largely right-wing media owned by vested interests</a> who were threatened by a popular left movement, took up the theme. A very small fire was fanned into a lot of smoke that damaged both the Labour Party and irrevocably smeared its leader. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4o514');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4o514" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4o514');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One MP, Luciana Berger, stated six separate death threats had been made against her because she is Jewish. While six death threats are six too many and nobody should be subject to this sort of treatment, she implied all six had been made by Labour Party members and the party was not dealing with it; in reality four of the six threats were made by far-right Nazis, who are not traditionally Labour sympathists; one by a far-left idiot with no labour Party connections; and the one threat coming from a Labour member resulted in prompt expulsion by the party and criminal action. Hardly institutionalised anti-semitism. </span>. While every newspaper gleefully took up the "Labour = anti-semitic" slur and regularly made it front-page material, during the same period there were lots of assaults on Jews by more traditional and implacable enemies on the far right, including an actual Nazi nutter firebombing a synagogue. The arson attack on the synagogue barely got a couple of paragraphs on an inside page, probably because it did not fit the narrative. Saner commentators pointed out that weaponising a largely non-existent anti-semitism, trivialising a real concern for the purpose of destabilising a political party, was an act of crying wolf - what would happen if at any point it became a more real and actual immediate threat?
</li><li> The Russian government under Putin has repeatedly frivolously accused its political enemies of terrorism. Thus, when US law enforcement received faxes from Russian authorities regarding two brothers, asylees in the US, who were terrorists, the faxes were disregarded out of hand and summarily sent through the shredder. Unfortunately, this time, the accusations were legitimate, as the two brothers, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Tsarnaev">Dzhokhar<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamerlan_Tsarnaev">Tamerlan Tsarnaev<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, went on to carry out the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing">Boston Marathon Bombing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> During the past several decades, the news media has run sensationalized stories about infections diseases, including SARS, MERS, avian flu, swine flu, mad cow disease, Ebola, and Zika. Ultimately, these diseases appeared to be more bark than bite. Natually, this was the reaction with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic">COVID-19</a> when it first popped up in 2020, and by the time people realized this was the wolf, it was too late.

Captain Jack Sparrow of Pirates of the Caribbean is an interesting case. It's not that he tells outright lies, but usually half-truths, and it's always for the purpose of manipulating people for his own ends. As a result, nobody actually trusts Jack fully and when it turns out he's been honest about something, it's pretty shocking.	</p>
