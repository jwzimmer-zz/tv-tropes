<ul><li> It's sometimes fun to actually <em>see</em> how someone gets past what should have been rock-solid security. Some people go for a version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge">Foe-Tossing Charge</a>. But then, in the manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, a five-story building has been filled with warriors and magic-users fully capable of matching Lina in a fight. As the villainess gloats about her tight security, Lina walks in. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">She just used a flying spell to float up to the top floor.</a>
</li><li> Memorably done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light</a></em>, when Kaiba specifically mentions sealing off all the entrances to the building with "steel shutters". Not fifteen minutes later Tea and Yugi's grandfather walk in with no explanation whatsoever. Naturally enough this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">The Abridged Series</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mokuba:</strong> But I thought I sealed all the exits? Oooh, I hate continuity...
</div><ul><li> You know, maybe trusting Mokuba with things like that isn't always a good idea...
</li></ul></li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Naruto, a 12 year old boy who had just failed (for the third time!) to become a genin, manages to break in to the Hokage's office and steal a scroll containing forbidden ninja techniques. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/NarutoTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/NarutoTheAbridgedSeries">Naruto: The Abridged Series</a></em> when the Hokage yells at a crowd of ninjas about it.
<ul><li> Earlier in that episode he was running away from defacing Hokage Mountain. Keep in mind that you can see it from just about every point in the village. Turns out this is intentional: Naruto is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a>, but he does have some skill.
</li><li> In the manga, the ninja find him painting the monument instead of escaping from doing so, and he gets caught by the Third Hokage, but escapes by using the Sexy Jutsu.
</li></ul></li><li> Chapter 482 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: somehow seven masked men are able to boldly walk into Captain-Commander Yamamoto's office to deliver their declaration of war against Soul Society. Even getting past the front gate has in the past been shown to be very difficult and doing so unnoticed should be impossible, as seen by the commotion the heroes caused when they broke in an earlier arc. Yet these guys aren't noticed until they walk through Yamamoto's door.
<ul><li> In the very next chapter, the intruders even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">mention this</a>. Yamamoto responds by saying, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">"I am here.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">There is no better security than this."</a>
<ul><li> This turned out to be justified, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their base is in the same spot as the Soul Society, but in a different dimension, meaning all they had to do was switch planes to Soul Society and be there, as they're shown doing later</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>: Motoko does this on a few occasions, but not without hacking the guards first.. and the first time not even having to do that.
<ul><li> The first time this happens, Motoko walks right into the front door of the mansion of a reclusive billionaire. The android maid-guard asks who she is. She just casually flashes her police badge, letting her get a good look at it, while saying that she's from a maintenance company and that it was time for a scheduled tune-up. The maid just stands back and lets her pass. When a Tachikoma walks in a few moments later, the maid asks who he is. He just responds that he's a Tachikoma and continues right on in.
</li><li> Another time this happened, Motoko casually strolls right past the security at the front door of a corporation. One guard asks if it's ok to just let her through without checking who she is, but his superior asks how he doesn't recognize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">that she's the photographer who's been working with the CEO for the past few weeks.</a>
</li><li> This is also the method that the Laughing Man uses. He just flat out hacks <em>everyone</em> in the area so that they just plain don't see or hear him walking around.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>: Saito, without being able to use any of his powers, manages to sneak into an air force base and steal a fighter jet.
</li><li> Versailles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRoseOfVersailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRoseOfVersailles">The Rose of Versailles</a></em> has this kind of security due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy">the incompetence of the guards</a>, to the point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Jeanne Valois said you only need a sword and a hat to walk up to the king</a> (and she and her husband failed in their attempt to meet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> to scam her only because they stumbled into Oscar, who, being the husband's superior officer, would have exposed them in a heartbeat had they gone through with it). It's so bad that Fersen and Oscar are surprised when the latter's soldiers in the French Guards unit she recently transferred to were not only doing their job before she could catch them lazying off and discipline them but <em>had actually caught Fersen when he was sneaking around</em> (as Oscar knew why he was there and was sneaking around, she had them let him go... And directed Fersen to a gate where the security was as bad as expected, and the guards weren't from her unit so it wasn't her problem).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SnowWhiteWithTheRedHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SnowWhiteWithTheRedHair">Snow White with the Red Hair</a></em>: Despite its fortifications, walls and guards the royal castle of Tanbarun has proven wholly incapable of stopping intruders. Twice groups of attacking infiltrators made in in, once a group of three made it in to confront the crown prince despite the guards being very much aware of them and being engaged by the small group, and a second time by a group of <em>two</em> individuals who were able to bypass the guards entirely even though the guards were supposedly aware they were going to try and attack a royal guest and were on alert.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>, Dr. Wily managed to sneak into Dr. Light's lab and reprogram the Robot Masters quite easily. This could be justified since the two were friends at the time, but Light never even knows they were there until the next morning.
</li><li> It doesn't get played up much in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> but in the original comic version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em>, Cardinal Roark lives in a parish protected by elite federal agents. It is so heavily fortified, it has earned the nickname "Fortress Roark". Marv goes into great detail about how dangerous the place is... just before killing several guards with his barehands and waltzing into Cardinal Roark's bedroom.
</li><li> While his mansion security in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> is practically non-existent, almost all comic book versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> are at least somewhat competent when it comes to security. Indeed, during the "Y2K" storyline (where Brainiac 13 seriously upgraded the city of Metropolis' tech level), Luthor's new, truly ridiculous security measures <em>kicked Superman's ass</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a>:
<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, when Spidey tries to intimidate the Kingpin by dropping in on him unexpectedly, only to realize that the Kingpin put in shatter-proof windows to get rid of such problems. Makes the web head lose his cool. Kingpin doesn't even blink at the sound of Spidey hitting his window.
</li><li> Wendell Vaughn. Getting your base broken into by a posse of supervillains once would be embarrassing. Having it happen <em>three times</em> on your watch, the third time ending with the attacker making off with damn near everything that hasn't been nailed down makes it look like someone took the wrong job. And yet, Wendell never seems to suffer any consequences.
</li></ul></li><li> The Rich Mansion (as in, where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich">Richie Rich</a></em> lives) is an odd case. The place naturally attracts lots of thieves (Richie's family stores at least a portion of their assets in vaults built inside the house itself; either his parents don't entirely trust banks, or they have more material wealth than they can store in them, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">might actually make sense</a>.) While it seems easy for crooks to break into and rob the place, they tend to be caught later rather easily; so while the place has yet to be the target of a perfect crime, it does seem like, at least, the perfect target.
</li><li> Averted when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> tried infiltrating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a>'s castle with an armor that can become invisible. When he tried, Stark forgot the little fact that Doom's had enough run ins with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvisibleWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvisibleWoman">Invisible Woman</a> sneaking around to have numerous sensors everywhere specifically designed to detect invisible intruders.
</li><li> One issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a></em>'s own title seemed to mock this trope. After effortlessly stealing a priceless statuette from a museum, she was rather disgusted at how incredibly <em>easy</em> it was, so she <em>returned it to the museum</em> with a note telling them how crappy their security was. They proceeded to upgrade the security... Then she stole it again, then returned it again, then stole it again, repeating the process at least a dozen times over the issue, even as the curator kept putting heavier security on the place. (Maybe she wanted to prove how good she was, or she simply had too much free time.) Eventually, the curator was considering letting her keep it - figuring he'd get more from insurance than the cost of protecting it - but she thought this was getting boring, and returned it to him in person, told him that his museum sucked, but left saying she'd keep an eye on the place. (As in, to keep him on edge.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> once broke into a remote Russian nuclear silo thanks in part to the incompetence of the guards.

The Shadowlands are a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">Mordor-like</a> realm filled with the Shadow Lords servants, its borders however are completely and totally unguarded. The heroes mention out loud that it's not quite what they were expecting. They figure it out when a small lizard runs across the border but hits an invisible wall on the way back. Turns out the Shadow Lord is quite happy for people to get <em>in</em>, they just can't get <em>out</em> afterwards.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>, Marcone doesn't even bother with security against Harry Dresden (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">mostly</a>...). All businesses he owns are instructed to give Dresden the VIP treatment, and escort him inside immediately with special discounts and lifetime memberships. He also knows that a sufficiently motivated Dresden can pretty much destroy any nonmagical barrier placed in his way, so at his actual hideouts he makes sure that the walls are crazy reinforced, while the most dramatically appropriate doors are designed to explode into as few dangerous fragments as possible.

He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">reflects on the lousy security</a>, saying it's because heroes rely on their own reputation to keep villains away.

The sole guard is an 80-year-old half-deaf geezer who spends all his time sleeping heavily and whose ancient WWI pistol falls to pieces if he takes it out. The teller and manager allow customers free reign of the place even when they're in the other room. People can waltz through the half-gate between the counter from the lobby without being stopped. The cash register drawers stand wide open with bundles of cash in full sight, as does the safe. And the safe can be entered by kicking a hole in the plaster wall of the hairdresser's shop adjacent to the bank. Of course, Mayberry doesn't <em>need</em> any effective bank security, what with its rock-bottom crime rate and genial, honest community — in fact, the only reason it was robbed in the first place was because an out-of-town robber overheard Barney ranting about the lax security in specific detail.
<ul><li> The Bank has a second attempted robbery later on where two crooks stage an elaborate awards ceremony that engages the whole town. Then another crook sneaks into the bank and opens the vault by listening to the combination. Once inside the Vault, the crook is greeted by Andy who is sitting on a chair calmly reading a paper. The crook demands to know how Andy got in, only for Andy to point out the back door to the vault that the town put in after they forgot the combination to the vault.

<ul><li> STAR Labs appears to have an "open door policy" for anyone who wants to come in. Partly justified by the fact that the lab no longer employs security personnel (in fact, it employs less than half-a-dozen people now, none of whom have any security training). Captain Cold ends up just strolling in without Cisco's alarm even going off. He is, however, supposed to be a master thief.
</li><li> In Season 2, Cisco claims to have upgraded the security system to keep anyone from coming in. Two seconds later, Jay Garrick walks in with no explanation <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> though he turns out he's actually the season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, which could possibly justify it</span>. Cisco's supposed "security system" constantly fails throughout the season, frequently not even warning anyone that someone is coming. During a cross-over episode, Team Arrow asks Cisco if he's finally gotten rid of that "revolving door" at STAR Labs. Cisco counters by pointing out that <em>both</em> Team Arrow headquarters have been broken into. The point is proven when Merlyn keeps randomly appearing there with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye">Stealth Hi/Bye</a> (not just by himself, but with over a dozen League assassins), surprising even Barry.
</li><li> The show has casually Lampshaded S.T.A.R. Lab's lax security enough that it has become one of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGags">Running Gags</a> by the third season.

<ul><li> Quietly subverted. It seems like practically anyone can walk into the DEO's top-secret base whenever they want, but they are always accompanied by armed guards, even though no one ever draws attention to them. The one time someone got in without permission was when Supergirl let in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">the Flash</a>, which is justified because they both have superspeed (and she'd have any necessary codes). Even then, the guards showed up within a minute.
</li><li> In season 3, the mother of an agent is brought into the DEO for her protection. The problem is that she is able to walk right into the armory, steal a weapon, and leave again without anyone noticing. In a later episode it's mentioned that they put a lock on the door after that embarrassment.
</li><li> Another subversion, this time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, in season 3. M'yrnn J'onzz, father of the DEO director J'onn J'onzz, ordered a pizza. When the delivery guy showed up at the top-secret government facility, the guards immediately tackled him. J'onn only finds out when M'yrnn asks him for some money, because he feels like the delivery guy deserves a really big tip.
</li><li> In season 4, Supergirl shows up in the Oval Office waiting for the President. While of course she has superpowers and could easily dodge any guards, none are seen or even mentioned.

<ul><li> Subverted whenever Michael needs to get somewhere. They almost always show (or at least reference) how Michael gets to where he needs to be and it's usually acting like he's supposed to be there.
</li><li> One Season Two episode has him walk into a government contractor with a friend claiming he lost his security badge. After he's inside, he further 'sneaks' into the high security area... by taking a soda can out of the trash and lifting a handprint.
</li><li> A later episode has Michael again trying to get into a government building in order to obtain something. He walks in pretending to be the weekend cleaning crew. However, getting what he needs requires him to trigger an alarm. How does he get out? He allows himself to get caught by security, pretends he's drunk (and cuts himself on the window he had to break), and begs security not to report it since he <em>really</em> needs the job or his wife will take away the kids. Security pities him, reports a false alarm, and escorts him to the front door while suggesting he take the rest of the day off to get clean &amp; sober.
</li><li> Another episode has Michael once again triggering an alarm while already having gotten what he wanted inside a high-security building (specifically, a <em>Police building</em>). He slips on a Police jacket and starts yelling at people to find the intruder. It's specifically mentioned that new recruits are trained to follow higher ups' orders without question, so all he had to do was act like one.
</li><li> Essentially, the show takes great lengths to avert this with the point it always makes being that getting somewhere is generally very easy. Ultimately, all security has some sort of weak spot whether it's a keycard, a person, or what not. It's getting into the right position to enter or leave without anyone thinking you're not supposed to be there that poses the problem.

</li><li> It also doesn't hurt that the sonic screwdriver can open any lock (except a deadlock seal), and disable pretty much any other security device, or that the TARDIS isn't exactly inhibited by walls.
<ul><li> In fact, the sonic screwdriver was so convenient for getting the Doctor out of danger that the showrunners wrote it out entirely for the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors' tenures.
</li></ul></li><li> This comes up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E1TheImpossibleAstronaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E1TheImpossibleAstronaut">"The Impossible Astronaut"</a>, where the TARDIS landed <em>in the Oval Office</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Canton:</strong> Mr. President, that man just walked in here with three of his friends and a great big blue box... <em>[points at the Secret Service head]</em> and that's the man he walked past. <em>One</em> of them is worth listening to.
</div></li></ul></li><li> The titular building of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em> was originally impossible to find, let alone break into or escape from, until the end of the first season. After that, characters seem to be able to get in and out whenever the plot demands it.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> three-parter "Look at the Princess" is full of this. Despite endless comments about how tight the security is in the lead-up to the Royal wedding, the various protagonists and antagonists have no problem carrying out various kidnappings, assaults and assassination attempts on each other. Partially justified since the members of the royal family were in on some of the kidnappings and assassination attempts to begin with.
</li><li> Most of the big mansions in Port Charles of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em> have this type of security. It gets ridiculous with Greystone Manor, the home of mob kingpin Sonny Corinthos. That many people who want to kill him, and pretty much anyone who wants to can just waltz onto the premises?
</li><li> A running joke on Sara M's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> recaps is how useless the hospital security is, only being able to catch a gunman in House's hallucinations and not in real life.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie">iZombie</a></em> characters frequently show up at the Seattle police morgue unannounced and unaccompanied.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a></em>, The Montecito gets robbed in just about every other episode despite supposedly having the most sophisticated security in the world.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> team is very good in getting past security but they usually have studied the target extensively and do a lot of prep work first. However, in one episode when they are forced to improvise, they are able to lie, steal and bluff their way through three layers of security so Hardison can infiltrate the control tower of an airport. Hardison is allowed in even though the security badge he is using belongs to a female employee and the guards verify the picture on the badge against Hardison's face. They do not want to be politically incorrect to someone who just had a sex-change operation so they let him in. The consequences of this type of failed security are quickly lampshaded when Hardison almost causes an airliner to crash.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLibrarians2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLibrarians2014">The Librarians</a></em>, multiple bad (and not always bad) guys have been able to infiltrate the supposedly most secure and secret location in the world. Partly justified by the fact that the Library only has a few employees and is <em>huge</em>. However, there is a limited number of entry points. Some of them, at least, can be justified by someone inside letting the invaders in. Other times it's simply unexplained, such as when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nicole got into the Library near the end of Season 4</span>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Eve Baird:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Again</a>?!

Unless the plot called for one of them to get captured, of course.

Colleen harassed Sean throughout half of the season, and in this time (from the point she is discovered to be an impostor) she managed to break into: the studio Sean was working in, his apartment to try to kill herself and die in his arms, his clinic (although it does have a flimsy security at best) in order to beg that he fixes her pulse, the Studio AGAIN, and this time presumably knocking out another minor cast member of the series he was part of since she took the role of an assisting medic within and in dangerous proximity to a blade, his apartment AGAIN to plant a BODY of a "rival" agent (she wasn't a real agent to begin with), and finally at his clinic AGAIN to try and murder him. That's made worse by the fact that she is an ordinary (albeit crazy) middle-aged woman. Not only does she break into 3 locations that ought to have some sort of security, she does so again in the SAME ORDER with apparently no difficulty whatsoever.

However, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> because, as far as Snow White and Prince Charming know, Rumpelstiltskin's powers are sealed and he can't escape. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He actually <em>does</em> have a means of escape, but he doesn't use it because his plan is working perfectly without him being free (and he needs his escape plan to be there so the heroes can use it later).</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> has an inversion: Jerry would not let one of his own neighbors into his apartment building.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>, virtually any character on the show is prone to showing up at Luthor's mansion unannounced to have a chat with Lex in his office, steal something, beat him up, etc. Hence the original title being Lex Luthor Security. The wiki actually <a class="urllink" href="http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Luthor_Mansion_security_breaches">had a page on it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Not that any other supposedly secure location is any better. If a secret government base or LuthorCorp installation is mentioned, it's practically guaranteed that someone is going to break in, super-powered or not. Lex himself once mentioned that he really needs to improve his security. (<em>Fanatic</em>) Apparently, he never got around to doing that. One of Tess' minions also lampshades how cheap the security is.

<ul><li> In "Shades of Grey", Jack O'Neill (who has been forced to resign from the Air Force in order to avoid criminal prosecution) is able to waltz into Stargate Command and straight into General Hammond's office, without security apparently noticing his presence at all. Now, he <em>is</em> a former Black Ops veteran and ex-second-in-command of the base, but it still stretches the bounds of plausibility quite a bit. In fact, <em>all</em> secret bases in <em>Stargate SG-1</em> seem to qualify, from Goa'uld strongholds to the SGC to NID prisons. The incident in "Shades of Grey" is actually more or less justified, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire thing was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> organized by Hammond and O'Neill, and the latter may have been secretly given means to bypass security and slip into Hammond's office undetected. Besides, O'Neill never actually resigned his commission.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> has nothing to brag about. The turbolift is apparently unrestricted, very often people who shouldn't be allowed in Ops unescorted (like Quark) stroll right in. Then again, Quark has proven he has security chips granting him security clearance even higher than Odo. He's just that good. In addition, Ops isn't so much a bridge like on the <em>Enterprise</em> as it is the manager's office (technically, a combination of the two). People are <em>supposed</em> to come up there with grievances and such (especially Quark, who is head of the station's business union).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> had perhaps the worst security in the history of Starfleet, considering how often enemies were able to steal shuttles or hack their computer.

The Torchwood staff finally admit they wanted to talk to her after they nearly bust up laughing at her "covert" entrance.

The employee finds the 'new employee' package he planted and assumes that HR simply failed to call ahead. When his security badge fails to work, she uses her own since new badges tend to glitch out.

Similarly, every door in the city will open to random passers-by, but heroes are not permitted entry unless they have a specific mission in the building.
</li><li> Even more amusing when the civilian you had just rescued on the street enters the same building you were about to enter to clear it of bad guys.
</li><li> And of course the same rules apply in <em>City of Villains</em>.

The "Magnet Beam" room from the first game and the platform hopping sequence to get in Sigma's front door in the first X series game are prime examples.

Get forty or so buddies and just <em>bum rush right at him</em>. There <em>are</em> guards flying on their own mounts that can demount you, but they're also very bad at it. The main security feature is that it's even <em>easier</em> for the other faction's players to show up and start trying to murder you, and that the faction leader is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a>.

If the Empire tries to take Echo Base with a frontal assault, they're in for a fight. If a trooper takes a couple of minutes to circle around and enter from the hangar, he can often capture the entire base without firing a shot.
<ul><li> Conversely, a Rebel player on the same map can grab a snowspeeder from the hangar, fly to the Empire's furthest stationary command post (the other command post is a proper base, and there are two AT-ATs that count, as well), and take it over within minutes of the battle starting. The command post has only a single trench for cover and a few turrets (which the Rebel player <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">can then use to destroy the AT-ATs</a> once the command post is taken over), and generally, the AI will do practically nothing to defend it.
</li><li> Played with on Endor with the Rebels. If you take a speeder and travel all the way around the map, and as long as no one sees you, you can pretty much waltz right into their shield generator building.

Pink Diamond was surrounded by attendants, including precognitive Sapphires, Agate bodyguards, and her personal Pearl. Moreover, Rose Quartz had been a known public enemy for centuries and all other Rose Quartz gems had been bubbled, so she would have been instantly recognizable. So how could Rose Quartz have possibly gotten close enough to shatter Pink Diamond without <em>anyone</em> trying to fight her off, or at least sound the alarm? We're given the answer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E18ASinglePaleRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E18ASinglePaleRose">later that season</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pink herself sent all of them but her Pearl away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">to fake her own death</a>.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>, the Autobots were able to stow away on the Decepticon spacebridge pretty much at will, since the guards were always graduates of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormTrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormTrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">Imperial Storm Trooper Marksmanship Academy</a>, especially poor Shockwave.

</li><li> Mind you, the Autobots were no better. By virtue of being on the small side, many were the times Laserbeak just flew in, and there was the time he <em>rode in on an Autobot in tape mode.</em> Soundwave managed to get himself carried in just as often.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Worst real-life example ever: <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fagan_incident">Michael Fagan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who not only sneaked into <em>Buckingham Palace</em> in 1982 but managed to get all the way to the <em><strong>Queen's bedroom</strong></em> and chat with her for a while while security finally came. Apparently the palace security was so used to the oversensitive alarms going off all the time that they had stopped taking them seriously ...
</li><li> Many chain stores don't put near as much effort into preventing shoplifting as they could, the reason being it would actually cost them <em>more</em> money than they lose to theft to take the preventative measures. Stores put a <em>lot</em> of effort into monitoring "shrinkage" (How much product is lost to theft, damage, etc) and have a value that, as long as the shrink is less than that value, everything is a-okay.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)">Social Engineering<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Just ask <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick">Kevin Mitnick<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a famous hacker. For example, need to get inside a door that can only be opened with a card key? Just stand outside, wait for someone to come by, say something along the lines of "I'm new here" or "I'm having a bad day, my card was destroyed..." People are nice enough to open doors with no questions asked. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">That is just one example.</a>
</li><li> A particularly devious method is standing next to the door while holding a bunch of (seemingly) heavy boxes, or folders, etc. Not only will people be willing to help you, but will most likely assume you have the card and just can't reach it. Many places where card access is given to people who haven't had any kind of security instruction have large signs actually instructing you to close the door in front of the next person. They don't work, of course (the real solution would be to actually train people). Most companies very specifically warn their employees against this, but people rarely cooperate. No one wants to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> who wouldn't let the poor new guy in. It's bad enough companies have had to make not making the person behind you use their own card a termination-level offense.
</li></ul></li><li> Passwords:
<ul><li> Similar to the above examples, the easiest way to get a password is to ring the building and say "This is Tech Support - can I have your Username and Password?" Despite the fact that Tech Support will <em>never</em> say this (they'll usually have an Admin Password that allows them into all accounts) and that people are warned never to give this info out, it still works a lot of the time.
</li><li> Some people will actually <em>volunteer</em> this information unprompted when they call tech support. The average person does not understand electronic security very well.
</li><li> It doesn't help that companies frequently require employees to remember passwords to several different systems and set up expiration periods, forcing people to create new passwords every X number of days. An average person is more likely to use the same exact password for all those systems, only changing a digit or two when creating a new one. Additionally, despite companies forbidding people from writing those passwords down, people do, since it's a hassle to call tech support every time they forget a password. It's amazing what you can find taped under people's desks.
</li><li> Speaking of passwords, the practice of masking password input fields continues despite contributing greatly to password weaknesses. Masking was developed when the only possible access was from public terminals to prevent the password from being seen over the shoulder of the typist. Now this is rarely possible since computers are usually used in where someone reading over your shoulder is unlikely. Masked passwords must be short and hence easy to crack since any typo won't be spotted until the password is entered. Where this practiced ended considerably longer and more secure passwords could be used since the user could spot any typos while entering it.
</li><li> Password security questions. Some services (usually email) will require you to pick from a set of pre-written questions and write answers to them, and if you forget your password, you're to answer this question in order to reset your password. Most of these pre-written questions will ask for answers that can easily be obtained through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialEngineering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialEngineering">Social Engineering</a> such as "What city did you grow up in?" or "What's your mother's maiden name?" (which for many is <em>their own middle name</em>); worse, most of the time you can't just make up your own questions. Granted, the next step after answering one of these questions is usually to then have a password reset link emailed to you and you'll need to be able to access your email account to use the link (thus security questions simply prevent random folks from spamming your email account), but if the question is the <em>only</em> thing guarding your account from a password change, the answer is effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePasswordIsAlwaysSwordfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePasswordIsAlwaysSwordfish">an extremely weak alternative password</a> in practice, unless you get crafty and make a password-grade answer that doesn't actually answer the question. Of course, you can always lie, if you can remember your specific answer, such as a pet of a species or type you never had.
</li></ul></li><li> A white hard hat, an ID that looks appropriate on a lanyard and a clipboard will get you in <em>anywhere.</em>
</li><li> An event in which a couple crashed a White House party pointed out this. The White House actually used to be like this <em>regularly</em>, up until after the presidency of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude">It was how the Prez kept in touch with the people.</a> It was still pretty easy to get into the White House <em>after</em> the Lincoln assassination, too. Charles Guiteau, the future assassin of President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesGarfield">James Garfield</a>, was able to get several <em>meetings</em> with the President to discuss his supposed pending appointing as Ambassador to France, even though Garfield didn't know him from Adam. Garfield's shooting was itself an example, as it happened in public when he'd entered a train station (without guards, to boot). Guiteau (along with everyone else) was able to simply walk right up. This applies to Lincoln (his bodyguard, a chronic alcoholic, left for a nearby bar, with no one stopping Booth from entering his box at the theater, albeit he was an actor who'd performed at it, thus his presence didn't arouse suspicion) and McKinley (shot while greeting people at the Pan-American Expedition in Buffalo, NY (Leon Czolgosz simply wrapping his hand and pistol in bandages, faking an injury to cover it). Security still wasn't really amplified before JFK was shot in an open-top automobile. In the wake of that, Presidential security is <em>very</em> tight, and none have been assassinated since.
</li><li> Several Russian officials caught a lot of flak when a group of students revealed that they had broken into a Russian nuclear facility with almost zero effort. Once they got past the fences, they had free run of the place and took photos of everything they came across. Apparently there were no guards stationed at the facility or they all just decided to go on break.
</li><li> While lobby guards keep an eye on who's coming into the lobby of a building, the building's employees and/or residents usually will politely hold the door open for anyone coming up behind who looks like they are coming in, too.
</li><li> Steve Gibson explains in <a class="urllink" href="https://media.grc.com/sn/sn-530.mp3">episode 530 of Security Now<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the public address system at most target stores is simply a three digit extension on a telephone. This is how <a class="urllink" href="http://hellobeautiful.com/2015/10/16/target-porn-over-pa-system/">someone was able to play porn over the loudspeaker<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In fact, this is the whole objective of the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm">Security Now<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> podcast.
</li><li> In 2011 the U.S. government <a class="urllink" href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/06/28/us-govt-plant-usb-sticks-in-security-study-60-of-subjects-take-the-bait/">conducted an experiment by leaving unmarked USB sticks around the parking lots of government and contractor facilities,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to test how many people would just pick up the stick and slot it in their machine to see what's on it, without any kind of security precautions. The result was 60%, which went up to 90% simply by having the logo of the place on the stick.
</li><li> Anyone who's done any sort of delivery service such as UPS or pizza delivery eventually encounters a gate requiring a code. Oftentimes, they'll be given a list of gate codes for their area or are allowed to ask. Thing is, now they have the code and can give it to anyone they want, including burglars, solicitors, or even just hacks who want to harass the people behind the gates. This is why most gates have "call" features these days which serve a dual purpose: keep the code safe, and also provide a convenient way for the person to reach a given address should they not know the code or another vehicle isn't driving in that they can just tail behind. The homeowner will only let people in on official business, and since they already know you're coming and have official business it isn't an issue.
</li><li> From 1968-1985, US Navy Warrant Officer John Anthony Walker acted as a spy for the Soviet Union, handing over thousands of pages of classified documents in exchange for millions of dollars in cash payments. Despite two decades of espionage, Walker was never even suspected of criminal activity by authorities. He received an honorable retirement from the navy in 1976 and continued his spying even after leaving service, getting his son (who was also in the navy) involved in his activities as well. Walker's downfall and arrest only happened as a result of his estranged ex-wife turning him in. When asked how he was able to get away with espionage for so long without being detected, he said, "K-Mart has better security than the Navy".
</li><li> Versailles before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>. It was bad enough that Marie Antoinette had additional bodyguards, and dodged Jeanne Valois's attempt at scamming her because <em>she herself knew Jeanne's fame and face</em> and instructed her guards to keep her away the moment she spotted her.
