However, in science fiction, things are often a lot worse. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeSpeculativeStratification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeSpeculativeStratification">Extreme Speculative Stratification</a> is what happens. This type of fictionalized society generally consists of some measure of central planning by elites, with all of the "dirty work" being done by workers. Expect for the latter to be thought of as a different culture, and in some cases may even be a different species.
</p><p>Rest assured that if this system is particularly oppressive, the heroes are not about to let this lie without trying to reform the system by convincing the rulers to change things. Or, if necessary, instigating or at least supporting a lower caste revolution.
</p><p>India's caste system is a popular provider for ample analogies. This trope might also owe a debt to both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a>, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia">utopia</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRepublic">The Republic</a></em> was highly socially stratified, as well as Karl Marx, in his conception of the relationship between bourgeoisie and proletariat. The feudal "three estates" system of warrior, cleric, and laborer is another common inspiration. Might also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedCastes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedCastes">Color-Coded Castes</a>. When a fantasy or alien race has specialized castes with physical dimorphism, as with worker and queen ants or bees, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveCasteSystem">Hive Caste System</a>. Compare with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeSpeculativeStratification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeSpeculativeStratification">Extreme Speculative Stratification</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanSegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanSegregation">Urban Segregation</a>, which have some overlap with this trope. Settings where the political system is based on alternative ruling methods like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">Magocracy</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">Theocracy</a> will inevitably have one of these systems to systematically organize what happens to everyone who doesn't have the traits desired of typical citizens. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica">Divided States of America</a>, which similarly extrapolates on a real-world situation. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveCasteSystem">Hive Caste System</a>, which adds a heap more fantasy.

<ul><li> Though barely explored, the aliens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NieaUnder7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NieaUnder7">Niea_7</a></em> have a caste system. The underbar in the title actually contains the words "under", which refers to eponymous character's caste level: "Under Seven", a very low caste. The highest is called Plus Five; a minor character is a Plus Five and is a TV presenter. In the end, he regresses to Under Five and is drinking in a roadside stall.
</li><li> The caste system of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Tanagura</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AiNoKusabi">Ai no Kusabi</a></em> where the elite are genetically engineered humanoids and the highest-ranking are called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite">Blondies</a>. The elites themselves are ranked by hair color to distinguish their classes. The humans born naturally in the slums are "mongrels" treated as the lowest of the low that can't even attain citizenship.
</li><li> The Saiyan race of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> had one of these during the brief period of time between them forming an organized society under King Vegeta and being driven to near-extinction by Frieza less than a decade later. It's a 3-tiered system, with King Vegeta and his son unsurprisingly at the very top as Super Elites, then the Elite Class which is numbered at around ten or so individual Saiyans (Nappa is the only confirmed member of this class, though Paragus might have been one as well), and then at the bottom the Low-Class Saiyans which are... well, everyone else. It's not clear if there are actual biological differences between the classes or if they amount to no more than cultural preening on the part of King Vegeta and his inner circle — Nappa and Vegeta have the ability to retain their reason in their Great Ape forms and have stronger tails than low-class Saiyans, but it is unclear if these are genuine biological advantages or simply trained feats that any Saiyan can master (Nappa mentions training his tail to overcome its weakness in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse">Dragon Ball Xenoverse</a> 2</em>). Turles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZTheTreeOfMight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZTheTreeOfMight"> Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might</a></em> also states that low-class Saiyans "only come in a few types", of which he and series hero Goku share a type (explaining their uncanny resemblance).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DawnOfTheArcana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DawnOfTheArcana">Dawn of the Arcana</a></em>, humans with black hair are nobles or royalty. Humans with other hair colors are peasants, although red hair is considered the lowest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly">Ajin</a>- humanoids with the ears and tails of animals form the lowest caste below that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic">Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic</a></em> features a Magocracy example, Magnostadt where the headmaster of the nation and university is the ruler, magicians are full-fledged citizens, and non-magicians (labeled as Goi by the very racist and vengeful headmaster) are segregated to live in the slums of the city and exist only to function as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredbyaForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredbyaForsakenChild">back-up mana battery for the nation when demands are high</a>.
</li><li> The Clover Kingdom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> is split into three realms based on magic power: Noble, Common, and Forsaken. This causes a lot of class prejudice, which pops up <em>a lot</em>.
</li><li> Cells of the Body in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWork">Cells at Work!</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spinoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spinoff">spinoffs</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWorkCodeBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWorkCodeBlack">Cells at Work! CODE BLACK</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWorkAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWorkAndFriends">Cells at Work and Friends!</a></em> are depicted as delivery people, policemen, geothermal power-plant workers, etc, with only stem cells and Naive-T's able to become something else, and once they do, they can't do anything else except their purpose-bred tasks. This is extremely visible with the Immune System, with all its subcastes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">cripplingly over-specialized</a> to fight or identify certain threats (except for neutrophils-ie, police officers who are dab-hand at fighting most bacteria).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GeneShaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GeneShaft">Gene Shaft</a> has a society where the artificially birthed citizens are stratified into various genetic types classified into colors based on their physical and mental capabilities, like Sofia having a calm personality due to her "purple" genetype. The lowest strata being the "white" genotype — which the protagonist Mika is a member of and suffered mockery for by many members of the society.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, the Underworld's human civilization assigns each person a Calling at a young age, determining their purpose in life, and anyone who accomplishes this is free to choose another. There are also nobles of various ranks, with higher-ranked nobles having the judicial authority to issue punishments to commoners and lower-ranked nobles.

While it's possible to choose a Guild, most people are expected to enter the same Guild as their parents, especially the Workers' Guild, who seem to have fewer opportunities to qualify for the others. (The others are Religious, Artist, Military, and Science. Science is, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRaceGuy">the most important</a>.)
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryComic">Furry Comic</a>, <em>Xanadu</em>, the society is divided into three castes in descending order, "Noble" (Fantasy Animals), "Freeborn" (Wild Animals), and the Domestique (Domestic animals). Dealing with this system is the feline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a>, Tabbe Le Fauve, who is determined to find his own way against this system and finds that the seemingly flighty Empress Alicia agrees with him, and is determined to reform the system in a politically astute way that will have a real impact.

Vampires form a superior caste (the criterion seems to be general evil, including such individuals as Attila the Hun, Nero, Vlad Tepes, Elizabeth Bathory, Aleister Crowley, and Robespierre), whereas zombies are generally those who didn't do much with themselves in life and keep doing so in death.
<ul><li> Lemures can only leave Resurrection when their killer/person ultimately responsible for their death has been expired.
</li><li> It varies, however: Alexander the Great, Saladin and Napoleon (and a Martian conqueror) are preserved in jars until Dracula needs tactical advice, while Dystopians are people who committed evil in the name of empire (coincidentally or not, they're led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> and Queen Elizabeth).

Construction workers are one of the lowest classes, Science class are higher, and the elite class rule with sleek alt-modes. At the absolute bottom are the Disposable Classes, the 'bots with modes so common they are essentially considered property. On occasion, someone could earn freedom from the status and do whatever they liked, but it had to be for doing something truly important. So far, only one known being did this, Momus the mine-foreman who went on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">to become a Senator</a> thanks to finding a Point One Percenter spark (he didn't personally find it, two of his subordinates did, but when they asked what their reward was they were informed that the energy pulse it had emitted before Momus and the Senate representatives arrived meant that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead">they were going to be dead in less than a day</a>).

He protested against the system, repeatedly, and nearly got killed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">brainwashed</a> for it, which led to him making the Decepticon movement so militant.

Travelers are clones of historical figures made for the Bosses' amusement. They go from place to place, passed from oligarch to oligarch, and treated as they see fit. At the bottom are common people, diseased, bitter, and short-lived.

The warriors are the ruling caste, something which the ritualists resent, but both warriors and ritualists claim that their class is actually subservient to the workers; they fight (and work magic) for the benefit of the populace. How much they genuinely mean this/live up to it varies from individual to individual.

This is aided by the fact that the Kan and Fon do not possess reliable long-term memories, and forget most things after a couple of weeks. The Sauron invasion leads to opening up old racial divides among humans, as the Saurons are naturally predisposed to treat darker-skinned people better than lighter-skinned ones, even if they consider all humans to be slaves anyway.

Originally, the division is between a large unskilled worker caste ("serfs") and a small, hyper-militarized capitalist and professional one ("citizens"), in which the former are essentially the slaves of the latter. Which has its own problems, but sort of makes sense. In later stories, however, the distinctions are muddled by introducing state-owned serfs, who are promoted well into the upper-middle classes and supposedly become critical to the functioning of the Draka state, even as engineers and astronauts — all the while they nevertheless still remain legally subhuman slaves, whom any jumped-up private or corporal in the military caste can abuse, rape or kill on a whim and pay only a small fine for destruction of public property.

There is also a planet called Heraldica, populated by the descendants of aristocrats and the Speshed servants. And yes, the servants love their jobs and turn their children into servants as well.

Next you have the <em>Multhari</em>: the military caste and the second most important caste group of Mythalan society. Some multhari are also <em>shakira</em>. These normally tend to dominate the upper ranks of the Mythalan military. Lastly, you have the <em>Garthan</em>: the non-magic users of the Mythalan culture.

Many — if not majority — of Hexarchate citizens don't belong to any faction, but if you want to have any career in the "faction specialities", you have to join one.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MerryGentry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MerryGentry">Merry Gentry</a></em> series, Faerie Courts are highly stratified. All the sidhe and only sidhe are nobles. Demi-fey, brownies, and other magically strong but physically weak types fill domestic servant roles. The incredibly strong but magic-less goblins are designated shock troops. Though some of the lesser fey can be nobles in their own courts, they are all subordinate to the sidhe nobles of the high court.

It also flirts with this caste idea, as while the Proles are the underclass neglected as animals, this has the advantage of giving them unlimited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">Bread and Circuses</a> and freeing them from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">Big Brother Is Watching</a>.

People of different "pures" are born to specific career fields and have a measure of genetic engineering to suit them to it, and the various purities are not supposed to mix; in the books, we see angels (the highest caste, priest-artists who create dreams and share them with all of Pangaea), magisters (government officials), physicians, academes, servs (who do menial tasks) and druds (who do jobs even the servs won't take), as well as the un-engineered, naturally-born "impure" and various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies">Human Subspecies</a> who are even lower than the druds. Meanwhile, within each pure are several "subpures" of distinct status, and keeping the status of the various subpures straight is a large part of Pannish etiquette.

</li><li> The society of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedRising">Red Rising</a></em> is divided into a color-coded hierarchy of fourteen different castes. At the top are Golds, the ruling class. Beneath Gold are Silvers (accountants, bankers, other financial workers, and innovators), Whites (priests and priestesses), and Coppers (bureaucrats). The third level consists of Blues (pilots and navigators), Greens (computer technicians), Yellows (doctors and scientists), Oranges (mechanical engineers), and Violets (artists). Underneath are the Grays (police and soldiers), and beneath them are Browns (household servants), Obsidians (genetically engineered super soldiers), and Pinks (massage artists and prostitutes). The lowest level in the society pyramid is the Reds, who are slaves in all but name.
</li><li> As mentioned above Plato's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRepublic">The Republic</a></em> suggested a caste system based upon a "noble lie" that when the gods created men they infused some with gold, silver, bronze, or iron. The castes are divided into three: the lower-class common people (viewed as animals but allowed basic pleasures), the guardians (who are not allowed to have any freedom at all, and conditioned from birth to only have nothing but State loyalty), and the philosopher-kings (recruited from the best and most loyal of the guardians, and who are expected not to <em>want</em> any pleasures other than the satisfaction of a job well done and good philosophizing). Interestingly, a common reading of <em>The Republic</em> is that this system is designed to <em>protect</em> the commoners from the depredations of the guardians, who (in this reading) would be driven by their innate ambition to run roughshod over the rights of the commoners if given freedom to do so.
</li><li> The Garth Nix series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSeventhTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSeventhTower">The Seventh Tower</a></em> features a large, towerlike complex which is home to an entire society with a color-based caste system, based on their color-based magic system, where a more powerful color in magic equated to a higher rank in everything else. A person who was designated Green, for example could use magic, visit floors of the complex, and engage in hobbies associated with Green and all lower-ranking colors, but couldn't do anything or go anywhere more highly ranked without special dispensation. At the bottom of the stack (and on the bottom floors of the complex) were an uncolored servant caste; being made a member of their ranks was considered the ultimate punishment. It is at least more meritocratic than most caste systems since the higher levels are based at least in part on competence and promotion up them is quite common.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShamanBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShamanBlues">Shaman Blues</a></em>, the ghosts have their own caste system based on intelligence and — partly — power. On top, there are the oldest ghosts, who over time amassed enough power to call the entire city their haunting grounds. Below them are ghosts ruling several streets, ghosts able to move only along the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeyLine">Ley Lines</a>, ghosts tied to their resting place; and finally the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyApparel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyApparel">gutsies</a>", ghosts with formidable power, but next to no intelligence. The wraiths are sort of "next to" the entire system, due to their predatory nature.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spaceforce">Spaceforce</a></em> books, the Taysan Empire has developed this trope to an extraordinary degree. Everyone is born into a specific caste which determines their occupation for life, from street sweeper to imperial, and nobody is permitted to convert to another — whether they have an aptitude for the profession of their caste, or not. Of course, the series' Taysan protagonists end up subverting this system.

It may not count as a "caste" system, however, especially since they tend to keep their societies separate, making their cooperation more akin to different nations trading with each other.

A division between those who retained them and those who lost them resulted in an unofficial caste system within the Klingon Empire. The ridgeless Klingons — the Quch'Ha, or "unhappy ones" — were somewhat undesirable in the social hierarchy. Some Quch'Ha disguised their status with artificial foreheads. The two Klingon races are discussed in depth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekForgedInFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekForgedInFire">Star Trek: Forged in Fire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekSevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekSevenDeadlySins">Star Trek: Seven Deadly Sins</a></em> in particular.

It includes Political, Warrior, Technologist, and Labourer castes. The Tzenkethi also have a caste system of sorts, with different echelons into which their citizens are placed after testing in youth. However, they dislike it when people use the term "caste system" to describe it.

Yrythny breed by laying eggs in the water, which develop as tadpoles before coming ashore later in childhood. Those young which come ashore at the same House at which they were laid are Houseborn and make up the ruling caste. "Wanderers" are considered inferior on account of having gotten "lost". Tensions between the castes are high, and a full-blown revolutionary war is threatening to erupt.

The G'Dok are the clan of the stronger brother (and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BinarySuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BinarySuns">first star</a>), and rule the planet with a great deal of arrogance; the Leahru, clan of the weaker brother (and second sun), are subservient and tread carefully around the G'Dok. Then there's the Efram, apparently wretched slaves who are seemingly identified with eclipse.

Also the Pandrilites, whose elevated and lower castes are supposedly now united by their adherence to the Three Virtues. Pandrilite protagonist Vigo has come to question this, though; an old mentor became involved with a radical sect insisting oppression of the lower castes is ongoing, and Vigo's faith in his people was shaken.

It's rather fluid, as people can move up in their caste for merit (as shown when Arrhae (a slave) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is freed and made a Senator for an act of incredible valour</span>) or down for dishonour or just selling themselves as slaves.

<ul><li> The Supreme Overlord is actually considered a caste unto himself, combining elements of all the other castes barring Shamed Ones.

Canines can advance in their rank, but most stay as is. The Omega are treated the worst, are only referred to as "Omega", and are forced to clean up after the others. Sunshine (a Maltese and thus weaker than the others) is seemingly permanently an Omega, but she's learned to enjoy her poor rank. Lucky dislikes the system and attempts to replace it with a democracy, however it's too confusing for his pack-mates and they end up reverting back to the caste system.

Tekns, as the name implies, as the scientists and technicians (according to Haurk, though, the similarity between the names is purely accidental), while the trills are everyone else. This doesn't mean that trills are considered lower than tekns. In fact, each group has its own government body, overseen by a joint council. Additionally, fraternization and intermarriage between the groups is not forbidden (one of Haurk's parents is a trill, and the other is a tekn). The only thing is forbidden is for a tekn to reveal unapproved technological or scientific information to a trill under the penalty of life imprisonment on the Pluto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony">Penal Colony</a>. When a child is of a certain age, he or she takes an aptitude test, which determines whether he or she is best suited for a tekn or a trill career path. It's also possible, but unlikely, for a trill to become a tekn later in life. A similar divide exists on Venus, although the colonists there aren't as strict about the division.
</li><li> H.G. Wells' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeMachine">The Time Machine</a></em> is one of the creators of this trope, having the protagonist explicitly comment that the two species, the Eloi and Morlocks, were a result of social inequality reaching an extreme. It does differ from later examples though, in that both the elites (Eloi) and workers (Morlocks) are dehumanized and there's more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">"quid pro quo"</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">Morlocks hunt Eloi</a>).

It determines whether one is a zenpass (citizen passenger, or person who has been restricted from having a vote) or zenvol (citizen volunteer, who has <em>at least</em> one vote based on applied intelligence). By an astonishing coincidence, Gewell himself is a very senior zenvol, with 15 votes.

Littlies (age 0-11) lived with their parents and were the only people allowed to have traditional family bonds. In fact, parents were encouraged only to have one child every 10 years to keep the population down and stop sibling bonds from forming. Uglies (12-16) were forced to move away to dorms and socially programmed to hate themselves and anticipate the upcoming "Pretty" surgery. New pretties were people who had just had the surgery to make them prettier <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and more complacent</span>, and they were encouraged to live a crazy lifestyle. Middle pretties were pretties with children and jobs. Late pretties or crumblies were the elderly, who often lived to their middle hundreds.

The royal Moroi have all the wealth and privileges, such as having a guardian assigned to them and being represented when there is voting for a new monarch. Non-royal Moroi tend to be working class, have to care of their own safety, and do not have a say in the electoral process. Dhampir guardians are trained their entire lives to serve the Moroi, do not inherit wealth, and receive modest payment. Non-guardian dhampirs are at the bottom of the social ladder. Either forced to leave Moroi society and work with humans or occupying marginal positions in Moroi society (mistresses and sex workers).
</li><li> Takisians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards">Wild Cards</a></em> have a bit of this, each caste being kept genetically distinct by rigid selective breeding laws.

The Anla'shok (Rangers) were often considered a fourth caste, separated by all the others. The Minbari system was consciously modeled on the Medieval European idea that society was divided between those who work (peasants, serfs, and craftsmen), those who fight (knights and other members of the aristocracy), and those who pray (priests, nuns, and monks).
</li><li> The Centauri have their own caste system, composed by Noble Houses (further divided between the emperor's own House, the eleven Great Houses, and the various Lesser Houses), commoners, free members of conquered races, and slaves (that include both Centauri and members of conquered races). Social mobility is guaranteed by the individual Centauri ability for machinations allowing commoners to rise to nobility and nobles to push their own House above at the expense of someone else (notably, the series show Vir Cotto's rise from lesser nobility to <em>emperor</em>, and the RPG mentions that at some point emperor Fetaro Bricona was originally a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Space Pirate</a></em> of commoner origin) and a number of ways for someone to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">Made a Slave</a> and for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">slaves to be freed and become commoners</a> (with due exceptions for two genetically engineered slave subraces of the Centauri).

</li><li> The Bant shard (the shard composed mostly of White mana with Green and Blue supporting it) in the <em>Shards of Alara</em> set employs a rigid caste system based on the acquisition of sigils, marks of great valor. While it is possible to move up depending on how many sigils one obtains, it's still monumentally difficult. The lack of black and red mana — meaning virtually no magic can cause unnatural deaths or aimless destruction, but at the same time no magic that supports ambition, desire, or emotional contentment — doesn't help.

<ul><li> The Tau Empire have four castes loosely based on the four Hindu Varnas but with elemental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>: the "Fio" (Earth) caste performs manual labour as well as scientific research, the "Kor" (Air) caste covers piloting and transportation, the "Por" (Water) caste deals with politics, diplomacy, and bureaucracy, and the "Shas" (Fire) caste serves as the Tau military. There is also a fifth caste: the "Aun" (Ethereal) caste, who govern the empire. In addition, caste members have a rank for their place within the caste. In ascending order from lowest to highest: Saal, La, Ui, Vre, El, and O. For example, a "Fio'La" is the equivalent of a factory labourer, a "Shas'Vre" is the equivalent of a military veteran or officer, and an "Aun'O" is the equivalent of a king or emperor. A Tau's caste and rank make up part of their name.
</li><li> The Tau castes are also racially defined, and are thought to have their origins in the distinct varieties/subspecies that made up the Tau race before the Ethereals united them. The Fire Caste are the largest statured and most aggressively-minded, for example. Air caste are the most extreme, having hollow bones and weaker muscles due to living almost exclusively in space; according to some lore, before space travel their ancestors had limited flight capabilities.
</li><li> The Craftworld Eldar, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">unlike most depictions of fantasy elves</a>, live very strict and disciplined lives, according to a "Path", which is basically a career choice. There are several, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">of course</a>, the civilian paths <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">tend to fall by the wayside in favour of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Path of the Warrior</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Path of the Seer</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Path of the Outcast</a>.

<ul><li> Unlike many caste systems, a path is not a permanent choice. Most Eldar will change path multiple times in their lives, moving on once they feel they have sufficiently mastered their current path. Some Eldar do get stuck on a path, unable to put it aside and focusing on it to the exclusion of all else. While such Eldar are naturally very skilled at their chosen path getting stuck like this is very dangerous since the obsession with their path goes against the controlled lives of other Eldar.
</li></ul></li><li> In Dark Eldar society, your position is directly related to birth; natural-born Dark Eldar are so treasured that they're automatically elevated to elite units regardless of their combat prowess, while vat-cloned Dark Eldar must work their way up (assuming they survive that long). Hellion riders also occupy one of the lowest, but most dangerous positions within Dark Eldar society as they are a combination of street thugs and small-time Mafia in Commorragh.

The small, wiry Skinks are the priest and artisan caste and act as attendants to the Slann, in addition to managing the day-to-day running of the civilization and acting as skirmishers and assassins during war. The strong, physically imposing Saurus are the main warrior caste, acting as frontline warriors and guarding the Lizardmen's treasures and temple-cities. Finally, the Kroxigor — colossal, hulking and dim-witted brutes the size of tanks — perform heavy labor and construction in times of peace, and in wartime join the Saurus on the battlefield, wading through enemy forces to pound their targets into pulp with their bare fists or colossal bronze cudgels.
<ul><li> The Kingdom of Bretonnia has its own version of the three feudal estates: Nobles, who thanks to Bretonnia's warrior culture all have to be anointed knights and serve as warriors and rulers, Damsels of the Lady who serve as priests and consists of female children with magic taken and trained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, and finally peasants, who do everything else. Changing one's caste (unless you're taken as a child) is nigh-impossible because only the Grail Enchantress (essentially the pope) can ennoble a peasant. Beyond that, being a noble requires all your grandparents being nobles as well, hence the children of an ennobled peasant are themselves peasants.

</li><li> The Vilani Ziru Sirka was divided into the food-producer caste (Naashirka), the industrial caste (Sharurshid), and the government caste (Makhidkarum) but their relationship is complex and tangled.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>:
<ul><li> The setting as a whole has a few examples, namely because most of the titular Exalts are split up into Castes as a result of the Exaltation (save for the Dragon-Blooded, who merely take on "Aspects"). A more mundane example is the country of Varang, however, which believes so strongly in astrology and the importance of time that a person's role in life is determined mainly by <em>when they were born</em>.
</li><li> While not so much social castes as power-based strata, the whole setting can be divided into four levels, basically; mortal non-Essence-Wielders (basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a>), Terrestrial-level Essence-wielders (enlightened mortals, Dragon-Blooded Exalts, lesser gods, and first circle demons), Celestial-level beings (Lunar, Alchemical and Sidereal Exalts, major gods and second circle demons) and Solar-level entities (Solar Exalted, the Celestial Incarnae, and third circle demons). Primordials hover somewhere around Solars, with more inherent power but nowhere near the flexibility.
</li><li> The Realm is basically divided into slaves, peasants, patricians (wealthier mortals with blood ties to the Dragon-Blooded host), and Dynasts (Dragon-Blooded families). Dynasts who don't Exalt are usually treated like red-headed stepchildren, and members of lower castes who become Dragon-Bloods are adopted by the Dynastic Houses ASAP. And of course, any who Exalt as Solars or Lunars are hunted down like dogs, this is the Realm we're talking about.
</li><li> There's also the nation of Varang, which uses an elaborate caste system based on astrological prediction. Newborn children have their stars read to determine what their talents will be when they grow up, and they are given a caste and corresponding tattoo to identify them. The ritual actually does work, in mechanical terms identifying what the child's favored ability will be. However, the ritual is not always performed by a competent astrologer, who are loath to admit when they realize they can't do it. As such, some unlucky individuals are mis-casted, or even denied a caste altogether, leading to a permanent semi-exile in their own nation.
</li><li> Autochthonia employs a caste system, consisting of Populat (workers), and the Tripartite (threefold ruling caste) of Olgotary (secular administrators), Theomachracy (spiritual and morale maintainers), and the Sodalities (technical experts), with caste being assigned at birth through an assessment based on aptitudes displayed over one's past lives (one nation also has a professional military caste, the Militat). Differs from most, since there's actually a fair degree of social mobility within the actual castes (high ranking Populats can have more authority and privilege than low ranking Tripartites), and many nations incorporate a noteworthy degree of caste mixing; relationships between members of different castes are not uncommon, major social events tend to be shared experiences, and familial kinship (although generally a minor concern) can connect different castes (and, in the one nation that places strong emphasis on family bonds, even the highest-ranking Tripartite can be dominated by their lowly lever-pulling parents). They also have the Lumpen, the lowest caste who are given the most degrading jobs, have few personal rights, and are often victimised by others. Unlike the others, nobody is born to that caste; assignation to it forms the main criminal punishment (for any caste) in Autochthonian society.
</li><li> The term "Caste" is typically used to describe where an Exalted's talents lie, rather than their prescribed role; there's nothing stopping, say, a martially-minded Dawn Caste from picking up Sorcery. The one person who takes it most seriously is the Deathlord Walker in Darkness, who expects his Abyssal Deathknights to fulfill every aspect of their assigned Castes. This is something of a problem, as he'll except a Daybreak Caste who's skilled in necromancy and necromancy alone to also be a loremaster, assign control of his armies to a warrior Dusk Caste despite the fact that he's insane, or expect a Moonshadow Caste who was a gladiator in life to serve as the best ambassador to the dead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> are divided into a series of castes based, essentially, on how central a role they play in the Wyld's all-encompassing narratives. Noble Raksha, who rule Fair Folk courts, possess the strength of will and list of accomplishments necessary to be notable as central players in their personal narratives; Raksha commoners are the servants and masses of limited relevance, lacking the impact necessary to be more than bit characters' swept along in others' narratives and barely even objectively real; hobgoblins are expandable, barely sapient troops created by nobles as cheap cannon fodder, servants and assorted supporting roles; wee folk are the least of all Raksha, created as little more than living props.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>: The Clans have their own caste system, with the warrior caste at the top. The scientist, technician, merchant, and laborer castes all basically exist mainly to provide for the warriors so they in turn can keep their attention focused on their calling without undue distraction. Caste placement is usually decided during the teens: Any Clanner (be they born within the Clan or taken as a bondsman) has the right to attempt to become a warrior (and pretty much everybody wants to), but the cutoff point is so extreme that the majority of aspirants 'test out' and are re-assigned to another caste instead.
<ul><li> There is also a second cut-off point on whether or not a warrior can obtain a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassageNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassageNameChange">Bloodname</a>: Those who are Bloodnamed are guaranteed lifelong membership in the Warrior Caste and can ascend to the highest ranks. Warriors who cannot become Bloodnamed by thirty-five are reassigned to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">solahma</a></em> units or demoted to garrison or police duties, and are usually first on the chopping block when new aspirants seek entry to the Caste.
</li><li> There's some variation within the castes as well. In the warrior caste, the freeborn (those born the old fashioned way) are always below the trueborn (those born from the clan's controlled breeding program). Among the Trueborn some of the Elementals who are bred to specialise as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> infantry tend to see themselves as superior but that varies a lot from Clan to Clan. Both the Elementals and the Mechwarriors are superior to the Aerospace Pilots since their breeding program never worked out all that well. Among the other castes, those among the scientist and technician castes who specialise in supporting the warrior caste, either through designing or maintaining the weapons of the warrior caste, or overseeing the warrior caste's breeding program, are higher status than other the rest of their caste.
</li><li> While most Clans adhere to the classic martial-oriented caste system, there is some variation. Clan Diamond Shark nominally has castes, but it is the most egalitarian of them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">considers merchants to be "warriors" in their own right</a>. Clan Nova Cat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousBruiser">being strongly into spirituality and finding your own path in life</a>, allows a lot of leeway to their scientists and merchants as a result. Clan Ghost Bear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">emphasizes family bonds</a>; a Trueborn warrior has lifelong friends, even among those that flushed out during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">their brutal training</a> to join other lower castes.

One's security clearance determines not only what information one has access to and one's level of authority within the system but the quality of one's food, one's living and working conditions, and how much the regime values one's very life. The system is meritocratic, with everyone starting at the lowest level and working their way up, but corruption is rampant and the "merits" by which one advances in practice include butt-kissing ability and aptitude for political scheming and skulduggery. It's based on an interpretation of the light spectrum, starting at Infrared (the lowest, rendered as black for practicality's sake) and working up through Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, and Ultraviolet (rendered as white, to contrast Infrared).

Before the Great Schism, Prophets were the leaders, followed closely by Elites, followed by Brutes, followed by Hunters, followed by Jackals and Drones, and followed by Grunts. Grunts received the worst treatment, being treated as a slave race by everybody. On the other side of the spectrum, the Prophets dominated the bureaucracy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TribeOfPriests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TribeOfPriests">clergy</a>, while Elites and Brutes were largely responsible for military matters. The Jackals are technically mercenaries rather than part of the caste system per se, but in practice, this makes little difference outside Jackal-only ships. There's also the Engineers, who only desire to fix and build machinery, and are treated more as valuable tools than as the sapient individuals they truly are (to the point that they're often forced to wear explosive harnesses in order to prevent them from being captured).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Forerunners</a> had a caste system of their own, called the rate system: on top were Builders, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">responsible for construction and design</a>, with the Master Builder becoming the true power behind the Forerunner ecumene towards its end. Next up were Miners, who obtained materials for the Builders. Then came Lifeworkers, the doctors, ecologist, and biologists of the ecumene. Then came the Warrior-Servants, soldiers who were seen as <em>technically</em> necessary but distasteful to the Forerunners, as they saw themselves as without conflict. Coming in dead last were the Engineers (who were technically not even Forerunners, given that they're the same ones used by the Covenant millennia later), who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">engineered</a> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">satisfied with just maintaining and fixing things</a>. There was also a rate called Juridicals who were in charge of law enforcement and criminal investigations; towards the end of the ecumene, much of this rate had become nothing more than an extension of the Master Builder's will.

<ul><li> The Dwarves of Orzammar practice a system in which each newborn is sorted in to one of eight castes dependent on the caste of their same-sex parent. Elevation is all but impossible. Those <em>without</em> a caste (criminals, exiles, and any children of the above two groups) are considered to be worth less than dirt and barred from obtaining any work or housing legally (unsurprisingly, this means the only work open to them is criminal in nature, thus intensifying hatred towards them). They will not be recorded in the histories, and so are deemed to <em>not exist</em>. Even aiding the casteless is considered a major social taboo for most dwarves, effectively ensuring that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedCriminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedCriminal">the casteless have to become criminals to survive</a>. The only way to ascend the caste system (and the only way for the casteless to be less than dirt) is to marry a member of a higher caste and have a child of the sex of the higher caste parent. Since there's only a 50% chance of this method working, it's not surprising that the slums are full of single parents raising a child of the wrong caste. The only other way to break the system is to achieve some great recognition and become a Paragon. The elders then elevate that Paragon's family to Noble or semi-Noble status.

</div><ul><li> The Qunari have a form of caste system as their religion prescribes distinct roles to members of the race that are inseparable from their personal identity. As far the Qunari are concerned, if you reject your given role you reject your identity and might as well be dead. They are utilitarian and believe that individuals are essentially tools with assigned functions, a sword cannot become anything other than a sword and a warrior cannot become anything other than a warrior. Roles are assigned at a young age based on the child's abilities and inclinations, not based directly on birth; that said, the caste that directs breeding rears children has had some limited success in creating specialist bloodlines.

<ul><li> Turian society has 23 different tiers of citizenship, each with its own set of rights and obligations. Unlike most examples of this trope, a certain level of upward mobility is not only possible but expected. For example, promotion from first to second tier is automatic upon completing the mandatory period of military service.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>, according to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">appendix</a> at the end of <em>The Deacon's Tale</em> novel, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Tarka</a> are divided into three castes, which have some subspecies traits: the Urduku ("Common" caste) are the warriors and professionals (they predominantly speak Urdu Kai, "common speech"), the Gutter caste are the workers representing the majority of the population (they speak various Gutter dialects collectively called Horodu Kai), and the Kona ("Exalted" caste) are the ruling class (speaking Kona Kai, "high speech"). The appendix does not mention if there are any social unrest due to the inability of persons to move from one caste to another.
<ul><li> The Hivers also have castes, but these are clearly defined by biology. Unlike your typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople">Bee People</a>, the Hivers do not possess a hive-mind. Each Hiver is a complete individual. The Warriors are best suited for high-risk tasks, such as warfare and security, and have varied physical shapes. The Workers cover the vast majority of jobs in the Hiver Imperium and are physically smaller and lighter than humans. Their jobs range from menial work to artistry and craftsmanship. The Royals consist of Princesses, Princes, and Queens. The Princesses and the Queens are the only females of the species. The Queens are fully matured and are able to bear not only Warriors and Workers but also Princes and Princesses. The Princes are the fertile males who are also generals. Unlike the Tarka, it's possible for a Hiver to move to a different caste, although this involves dying. When a Hiver dies, most of his memories are stored in chemicals in his head. If it's eaten by the Queen, she can then lay another egg, imprinting the new Hiver with the memories. In effect, the Hiver is reborn. For example, one of the main characters in the novel is a Hiver Prince named Chezokin, who used to be a Worker named Chekin (the "zok" infix is added to a reborn Hiver's name). This is only done to those who have honored the Queen with their service. The Hivers also have three main written languages, although these are not restricted to castes. K'en-k'en is a phonetic language (like Japanese katakana and hiragana), known by all Hivers. Ri'kap-ken represents words with complex symbols based on an ancient writing system (like Japanese kanji) and is mostly used by Warriors and bureaucrats. Tcho'to-ken is mainly used by the Royals to write poetry and personal diaries and is a form of calligraphy.

The Kel'ariy are the governing caste, the Ver'ash are doctors and medical researchers, the P'aedt do most other science research, the Nil'kemorya are the military, and the Tre'pira are the labor caste (which ranges from construction all the way up to ship captains). Each caste is assigned governance of its own systems, with a prefix added to the name of the star indicating who owns it (for example, most border planets are Nil'kemorya worlds). Oddly the Tre'pira are the most honored caste because they're seen as the backbone of Polaran society. <br/><br/>The odd man out is the Mu'hari, a caste created after the Polaris Civil War. These are made up solely of citizens who failed the tests to enter another caste. They learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">a little of everything</a>, but their primary duty is to ensure the survival of Polaran society, which in practice makes them the Polaran diplomatic and intelligence service, as well as providing internal security. They are semiofficially the lowest-ranked caste, as no matter what they are doing they are required to drop everything to assist any other Polaran who asks them to do <em>anything</em>. They are not shown as looked down upon by other castes, but many of them consider their Casteless Caste a mark of shame for themselves and their peers (one usually bubbly Mu'hari is seen depressed on the day she must swear in new members to the caste)

They're divided into three "soldier" classes (Churls, Caitiffs, and Kynvals), two "officer" classes (Kynreeves and Kynmarchers), and two "noble" classes (Markynaz and Valkynaz). The former three represent the military ranks of lesser soldiers, with Churls being the untrained disorganized rabble that form the bulk of a clan's fighting force, Caitiffs representing shock troops, and Kynvals being soldiers that distinguished themselves in combat and displaying the potential to be future leaders of their clans, as well as being the equivalent of knights. The other four are more important, politically-oriented roles, as they respectively represent clan officers, grand dukes, lords, and princes. There are also many other ranks, such as Kyngald and Narkynaz, whose positions in the overall hierarchy is largely unknown. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> includes one Dremora Feydnaz, but where this caste fits in is unclear (though he functions as a stronger Valkynaz).

Alita encounters some Ishkai who have fled their masters but are now in danger of recapture, and she has the option of either helping the Ishkai (on the grounds that slavery is illegal in Corwenth) or the slavers (citing distaste for defiance of authority).

Since they are so numerous and low-ranking, the death of the members of these castes is considered a normal occurrence and hardly even a crime. Higher castes are more likely to be murderous and psychotic, have greater physical strength and longer lifespans (up to many centuries), and the royal castes (violet and fuchsia) are amphibious, tend to live underwater, and are so long-lived and hardy that they have been described as "basically immortal". Only the empress and her heiress have fuchsia blood, and they can live for thousands of years, upper lifespans being completely unknown.

There's considerably more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> against lowbloods, with most of them fated for jobs that serve highbloods should they even make it to adulthood. It also seems that even higher blood castes are limited to a similar type of profession. For example, a few Tealbloods are involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge">Alternian law</a> similar to Terezi and her ancestor, since tealbloods who don't do so are culled for abandoning their duties, and all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownSpecies">Purplebloods</a> seen so far wear face paint and appear to be part of the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">religious following</a> as Gamzee and his ancestor.

Reds are commoners, Blues are scientists, Oranges are high-level workers and artisans, Golds are guards and bounty hunters, and Gouttouve (gutter foxes) are those whose colors don't fit their professions. Before King Rashon's coup Whites were the leading caste, Silvers were their advisers, and Blacks were elite guards. During the coup, Rashon convinced the Golds to wipe out the Whites, Silvers, and Blacks and declared himself a "Royal Red". In addition, the ancestors of the Whites, Silvers, Blacks, and at least some Golds were genetically experimented on by an alien race that invaded some 700 years previously. Blacks can manipulate energy like a Technomage, Silvers have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>, and Whites have both powers and Charisma.

In order, those are Spades (rulers and diplomats), Hearts (priests, teachers, and scholars), Clubs (farmers and hunters), and Diamonds (merchants and engineers).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Outsider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Outsider">Outsider</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Loroi</a> society is rigidly stratified and subdivided, with a Loroi's career and place in society being heavily determined by which caste she's born into.
<ul><li> Society as a whole is split into three main social groups — the warrior class, the civilians, and the men. Warriors, in addition to the military, also make up the Loroi empire's government, while civilians are secondary in importance and position and the men — being about eight times less common than the women — are essentially sperm banks with citizenships.
</li><li> The women's classes are further subdivided — the civilians are split between numerous specialized trade guilds, while the warrior class is further divided into six specialized castes: the Soroin (soldiers), Tenoin (spacecraft pilots and crew), Teidar (combat psychics), Torrai (commanders, admirals and generals, the title of Emperor being the caste's highest rank), Mizol (diplomats and telepaths), Listel (scientists and analysts), Doranzer (medics) and Gallen (mechanics). There are also subtle but significant biological differences between different castes: the Listel, for instance, have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EideticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EideticMemory">Eidetic Memory</a>, while the Teidar and Mizol are more psychically gifted than other Loroi.
</li><li> The Loroi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">highly martial culture</a> also means that the more martially oriented a group, the more important they tend to be. In broad terms, the Loroi social pyramid has the Torrai at the top, then the Mizol, Teidar, Soroin and Tenoin, then the Listel, Doranzer, and Gallen, then the civilians. The men exist largely outside this system.

Subsidies for certain humanimal genetic templates ended up tying "species" to one's socioeconomic status, with rats (the first subsidized template) at the bottom and rabbits, housecats, dogs, "exotics" (less-common species, nearly all custom jobs) above them, unmodded humans at the top. The story starts with a rat garbage scavenger finding an amnesiac cat girl in a bio-tank, who shows signs of having been an exotic <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or even human</span> before.

Atshi and Luntshas rite is the Housekeeper, and housekeepers are treated like second-class citizens, not being permitted to go anywhere without an escort and expected to stay home, do all the chores, and look after the children. Since housekeepers are designated long before adulthood, there technically isnt a rule prohibiting them from attending school, but they are looked down upon if they choose to do so. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Shimei treats Atshi like crap for this reason</a>, and Atshis hopelessness with magic only makes it worse.

The Tops/Highs are praised and revered, usually being the leaders or important figures of society, Mids are usually just treated as normal people, and the lows/bottoms are usually ridiculed and ostracized, often being beaten up for fun and not respected.

</li><li> The Fire Nation's system is partly tied to its colonial empire. In descending order from highest to lowest on the pecking order, you have: the Fire Lord, the royal family, the nobility and Fire Sages, the managerial middle class, peasants, and then colonials at the bottom. In turn, the colonies divide into Fire Nation citizens and Earth Kingdom non-citizens, although in the colonies even earthbenders (otherwise disparaged by their Fire-supremacist occupiers) can become Fire Nation citizens if one of their parents was a citizen.

By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, the warrior class appears to have been abolished in favor of a professional army.
