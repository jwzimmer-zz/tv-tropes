As Rimmer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> once stated, "All most of us get is 'Mind that bus, what bus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookBothWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookBothWays">splat</a>!'" This trope describes those who have some lead time, have some time to tidy our affairs, get our house in order, say our final goodbyes.

When you have nothing at all left to lose, that's when you can truly give everything you've got.
</p><p>This trope gives a writer a lot of flexibility in writing for a character. Heroes can become villains, villains can try for redemption, utterly minor characters can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADeathInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADeathInTheLimelight">step into the spotlight</a>, sane characters can go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> or turn into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">The Unfettered</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiters</a> are removed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambits</a> are prepared, characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">suddenly not left handed</a>, and no one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum">Holding Back the Phlebotinum</a>. Dancing the Last Dance can have lasting repercussions for a show, changing the dynamic.
</p><p>For the dying character, The Last Dance can blend with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle">Do Not Go Gentle</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a>, but it is more personal; the rest of the world goes on. A common twist is for the character in question to find out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForDying">they're going to live</a>, and have to deal with the consequences of their actions after all.

Compare also with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWereDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWereDying">Like You Were Dying</a> for a last dance of joy. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDyingWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDyingWalk">The Dying Walk</a>, which is about a dying character walking away from whatever they were doing or wherever they were just before death, often in search of a peaceful place to die. Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, where the last act is the <em>cause</em> of death, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfSacrificeScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfSacrificeScheme">Self-Sacrifice Scheme</a>, where the <em>entire act of his life</em> is the cause of death. Of course, a dying character is more likely than otherwise to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> or to employ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> tactics; after all, they aren't giving up all that much extra time. If they extend The Last Dance to last for way, <em>way</em> longer than the song's supposed to go, then they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingOnBorrowedTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingOnBorrowedTime">Living on Borrowed Time</a>. One should be careful when invoking this trope around creatures of vast magical power - you can still get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>...

The third personality takes control here to try and bring down as much of humanity with her as she can, all the while murmuring "Painful."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> Looooves this trope. In the first arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kamina</span> pulls off the first Giga Drill Breaker after being clinically killed by Thymilph, then we have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kittan</span> doing <em>his</em> first Giga Drill Breaker after entering the absolute killzone of the Spiral-Energy Absorption machine, and last of all with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nia</span> of all people who teams up with the rest of the gang to take out the Anti-Spirals and makes it through sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">Heroic Willpower</a> to finally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> marrying</span> Simon before fading into non-existence, having known and accepted that that would happen all along.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: After losing everything (his friends, his allies, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConfidant">confidant,</a> both his family, and as a result, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">his hope,</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch</span> decides to pull out all the stops in order to defeat his enemy.

<ul><li> But what happens next is even worse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His mom whose death he wanted to take revenge on the Emperor for turns out to be alive and well and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth">a co-conspirator of the Emperor.</a> So he has to kill them both. Now, with the last of his primary motivators gone (avenging Marianne), but certainly no more optimistic from the experience, he refocuses on making a better world for everyone, involving taking over the freaking planet and being <em>so</em> much of a tyrant that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit">everyone's anger gets focused on him,</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">then dying.</a></span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> this trope is the reason why Death Note users with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">shinigami eyes</a> cannot see their own lifespan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gauron</span>'s original mission <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in infiltrating the Tuatha de Danaan was to deliver the submarine and the Whispereds on board to Leonard of Amalgam. He chose such a risky method and didn't seem to particularly care if the de Danaan and all its passengers were destroyed because he had pancreatic cancer and would soon die anyway</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> there's Kimimaro, the most loyal of Orochimaru's servants, who admires Orochimaru so much that he is willing to be his next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">vessel</a>. However, due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">disease</a>, he can't, and so decides to help bring the only other worthy vessel to Orochimaru in his <em>literal</em> final <em>hours</em>.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> To do so he just had to defeat two of the main characters including <em>the</em> main character without breaking a sweat while enduring incredible pain, and then almost defeat Gaara, twice surviving an attack that uses sand to completely crush someone and make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfBlood">Rain of Blood</a> out of it/them (that never before failed) and being <em>buried</em> only to be stopped by is own disease killing him. Made all the more tragic by his last words in which he declares that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">only Orochimaru ever understood him</a>....and cut to Orochimaru saying that Kimmimaro doesn't matter. Bonus points in the fact that he actually calls his attacks "dances", so it makes this trope a little more accurate in that part.</span>
<ul><li> Zabuza gets this too. Following the death of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a> Haku, utter defeat at the hands of Kakashi, the smashing of his dream to eventually become Mizukage and betrayal by his employer Gatou, he is given a lecture by Naruto on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> that forces him to admit that yes, he did care for Haku, despite acting like he didn't give a damn, and takes off his mask, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> that he is human after all. He proceeds to mow through Gatou's thugs and kill Gatou with a kunai <em>in his mouth</em>, suffering numerous fatal wounds in the process but lives long enough to ask Kakashi to place him next to Haku.
<ul><li> And just to be completely clear, he lost the use of his arms BEFORE taking on 20-ish hired thugs to get to Gatou to kill him. That kunai in his mouth? That's his only weapon. Granted, the thugs were pretty puny and if he'd still had his arms he probably could've killed all of them and Gatou without hardly interrupting his fight with Kakashi.
</li></ul></li><li> Itachi's life can be interpreted as an epic 7-year long Last Dance, waiting for the day that Sasuke will kill him.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> Superman story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheManOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheManOfTomorrow">Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?</a></em>, a lot of villains from Superman's past are all showing up in rapid succession. Superman eventually figures out they're going to actually manage to kill him this time when some of his old buddies from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> (who, being from the 30th century, know <em>exactly</em> when Superman died) show up "just to say hi" and give him a little statue.
<ul><li> In a twist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> happened to be visiting the 30th century at the time the Legionnaires decided to come pay their last respects, and she comes back with them to what is (for her) the future (confused yet?). She accepts the reason for the trip at face value and is mildly curious about what she herself grew up to be like. This puts Superman in a difficult spot since by that point in the then-current DC continuity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">she had been killed in the battle against the Anti-Monitor</a>. Superman therefore has to avoid letting her find out that not only is <em>he</em> about to die, but <em>she's</em> already dead. The fact that the Legion's time bubble popped in right around the corner from a memorial statue to Supergirl doesn't help.

Many superheroes and gods are dead, but Batman has a plan to upload a virus that will kill all of the parademons that have already destroyed or enslaved most of the world. It's DC's Holy Trinity having a no holds barred battle to kill as many of the invaders as possible until Batman can upload the virus. Wonder Woman and Superman both die holding off hordes of parademons, and Batman uploads the virus, fully knowing that the control tower would self-destruct once he did...and he didn't mention it to his closest friends, or his daughter, until the bitter end. Notable in that all three of them knew they were probably going to die, and that the city they were fighting in (Metropolis) was already dead, along with most of their friends and family. This wasn't just a "save the world" mission, it was them taking out their rage on the invaders.

Both Captain Jacks fall for each other, but Torchwood Jack is aware that his namesake is killed the next day and while he doesn't directly tell him this, the real Jack seems to figure it out. This trope kicks in quite literally, and the two men share a dance and a kiss before Jack heads back to the 21st century. Presumably the real Jack would not have had the courage to dance with and kiss another man in front of quite a few other people in homophobic 1941 had he not known that he'd be dead the next day.

<ul><li> Hamilton himself wants to go out in a blaze of glory, as noted with some worry by Washington and his wife Eliza.

</li><li> Burr subverts the trope just before his duel by saying that "this man [Hamilton] will not make an orphan of my daughter".
</li><li> Hamilton invokes this trope hard as the bullet travels towards him. He first echoes the above words from <em>Yorktown</em>, makes peace with Burr, and sees who's waiting for him "on the other side": his mother, who died when Hamilton was a teenager, his friend John Laurens, who was killed in a needless battle after the ending of the Revolutionary War, Washington, who had died some years earlier, and Philip, his son who was killed in a duel defending Hamilton's honor. Hamilton then thinks of Eliza and tells her that he'll see her on the other side.

Lance is not amused; he's also cornered, and proves to be what is most likely the single toughest fight with one person in the game, fiendishly accurate, using a lethally powerful gun, and able to soak up so much damage you'd think he was entering the "full health" cheat code during the fight.

This is also a big deal because Goetia was originally immortal and was incapable of comprehending the beauty within mortal lives, and it was this inability to understand that drove his entire plan; now that his own death is imminent, he fully understands how humans' mortal bodies are in fact a gift, and wants to make his death as meaningful as possible.</span>

The cruelest part comes right before the final test (where he is to be propelled into the air with anti-aircraft missiles shot at him) and the doctor shows up to give him the <em>right</em> diagnosis. (Thankfully, the jacket, again, holds up.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)</a></em>, Donatello invents a device that can give a medical physical in less than a minute. While he, Mikey, and Leo are shown to be in perfect health, it gives Raphael a really bad diagnosis, which is not helped when he overhears Mikey and Don lamenting about what might happen to him. (In truth, they're talking about a ruined pizza.) Raph decides to go buy a superhero costume and do very public and dangerous heroics, including recovering a defoliant that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> throws into a volcano in an act of eco-terrorism. Of course, Don's machine was defective, and they have to help him before he <em>really</em> gets killed.

<ul><li> Andrew Cunanan was suspected by some to have gone on his murder-suicide spree, killing five people including Gianni Versace, thanks to believing himself to have been infected with HIV, but his autopsy proved him to be HIV negative.
</li><li> This was tested in a real-life experiment in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki">Feudal Japan</a>. A sensei (head teacher, in this case) of a school of fencing had a servant who'd been with him for years — and one day he was notified that the servant was wanted by the Shogunate authorities for a crime punishable by death. The sensei bowed and asked for a few days before turning the man over, then went to his servant, told him the news, and challenged him to a live-steel sword duel. The sensei had had a theory for a long time that a man who knew he had nothing to lose would fight harder and wanted to test it. It turned out to be correct; the servant fought like a man possessed, and after a while, the sensei was backed to the wall and staring defeat, disgrace, and death in the face. Summoning up all his skill, he finally did manage to cut his servant down, and his theory was doubly vindicated.
<ul><li> A widely common practice in Japan, and to a lesser degree in other East Asian nations such as Korea, was the writing of a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_poem">death poem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, often times written just before one faces an imminent death, such as just before committing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">Seppuku</a>, or going into a last stand or suicide attack.
</li></ul></li><li> Roman Empire had three punitive sentences for the arena: <em>damnatio ad bestias</em>, <em>damnatio ad ludii</em> and <em>damnatio ad gladium</em>. The first was an outright death sentence by being tied to a pole and torn to pieces by beasts while the second was being sentenced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames">Gladiator Games</a>, with hope of <em>missio</em>, being freed after two years or surviving five fights. But the last was literally being "sentenced to sword", being sentenced to gladiator games with <em>no hope of liberation whatsoever</em>: they were forced to fight until they were killed. They basically had nothing to lose, and they were claimed to be the most dangerous opponents, even if they had little fighting skills, because of their desperate situation.
</li><li> The following quote is attributed to the writer James Baldwin: "The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>. Having learned of his disease, he resolved to write as much as he could, while also advocating the right to euthanasia. He remained awesome and intense until the very end. Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a> wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em> as a kind of literary swan song while dying of tuberculosis.
</li><li> Ironically, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> collaboration that contains the lyrics "this is our last dance" (specifically the song "Under Pressure") isn't an example for either artist. For Queen, a better example would be <em>Innuendo</em>, their last album released during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury">Freddie Mercury</a>'s lifetime, containing touching farewell songs like "These Are the Days of Our Lives" and concluding with the triumphant number "The Show Must Go On." (Even more awesome, despite being in the terminal stages of AIDS and seriously weakened at the time, Mercury recorded "The Show Must Go On" in a single take, after a shot of vodka and a declaration of "I'll fucking do it, darling!") Bowie's swan song, meanwhile, would be his album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackstarAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackstarAlbum">★</a></em>, released on his 69th birthday two days before he died.
