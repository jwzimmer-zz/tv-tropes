</p><p>One often has to wonder how much money repeat offenders of this trope waste on ammunition.

It makes a touch more sense with characters who have protective devices like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>'s bracelets or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s shield. At least with those characters, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> can realistically think they have a chance at hurting them if only they could get that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">lucky shot</a>, which never happens. Many mooks also decide to do this because they believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd">showing defiance</a> is better than the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">occasionally fatal, often MUCH more painful</a>) alternative of disappointing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMobBossIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMobBossIsScarier">their boss</a> by giving up.

Often they'll even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourGunAtTheEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourGunAtTheEnemy">throw their empty gun at him</a> once they've emptied the magazine, to no effect (though old live-action Superman shows would sometimes have him duck or otherwise dodge the thrown prop guns). Particularly dense examples will then pull out another gun and try again, or pick up a chair and smash him over the head with it... And then do it AGAIN and again until Supes has had his fun and proceeds to twist them up like a pretzel.
</p><p>Justified in circumstances where the monster of the week just has lots of hitpoints, or in circumstances where the attackers have no reason to know or believe that the enemy is really totally immune to bullets; in real life it would be unlikely for the world's collective military to take one swipe and announce:
"Oh! He's obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>!

<ul><li> Both an example and a subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em>. When regular people such as Yamagata attempt to shoot Tetsuo, he either deflects the shot or reverses its direction. However, because of Kaneda's connection to Tetsuo, when Kaneda shoots him the bullet isn't deflected, with Tetsuo's reaction to being shot in the first volume implying that he HAD meant to deflect the shot and failed.
<p></p></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BirdyTheMighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BirdyTheMighty">Birdy the Mighty</a></em> has shown a resistance to bullets and in the remake manga, this was explained as a biological shield, though it's not invincible and with proper attacks, it can be pierced—and even then, the impacts hurt as Birdy flinched even a bullet hit her face in the OVA, and in <em>Decode</em>, she complained about them hurting in the first season and got knocked over for a second by a shot from a revolver in the second.
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> Accelerator's past where everyone uses him as a Shooting Superman. It didn't work in the past, why would work in the present? Most of the time, Accelerator flat out <em>ignores</em> the majority of his attackers; his passive defenses will slaughter them all, they're not worth actually fighting.
</li><li> People often ineffectually blast Touma Kamijou with magic or esper powers despite his ability to negate them with his right hand, Imagine Breaker. Ironically, it's easier to attack him with regular weapons because he can't negate them. Touma is also sometimes forced to run when faced with multiple attackers as he points out he only has one right hand.
</li><li> In an early episode of sister series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em>, the opponent of the week attempts to use a taser on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Mikoto Misaka</a>.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Happens constantly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">Cyborg 009</a></em> by both regular criminals and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganisation">Black</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">Ghost</a>. Even though Black Ghost should know better, having built the cyborgs.
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: In the manga and movie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the SPK/task force members think Ryuk is writing their names in the title book, and try to stop him. Bullets don't do jack against shinigami, but luckily for them, Ryuk was actually writing <em>Light's</em> name, having finally grown bored of him now that the game has run its course</span>.
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DemonKingDaimao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DemonKingDaimao">Demon King Daimao</a></em>: Ganging up on the guy destined to become the Demon King—bringer of death and destruction, eater of babies, and ravisher of women—with pipes and other assorted items is one thing. He's not a demon king <em>yet</em>, and he might be all show. <em>However</em>, when said guy shrugs off a heavy blow to the back, mocks your efforts, and proceeds to turn your friends' feet into bloody pretzels <em>with the power of his mind</em>, charging in with a metal chain and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokeShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokeShield">cheap magical barrage</a> probably isn't going to help you much either.
<p></p></li><li> This happens during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a>'s</em> Buu Saga. Fat Buu has pretty much trashed the world at this point, laughing off whole armies like they were cheap toys and wrecking cities at will. So naturally, when Mr. Satan (with the help of a stray puppy) manages to talk him down and get him on the verge of a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>... two mooks with sniper rifles decide to snipe the creature that laughed off tank fire on national TV. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">It didn't</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">end well.</a>
<ul><li> During the Cell arc, the entire army surrounds Perfect Cell and lay on him with continuous gun, tank and missile fire for almost a full minute. It doesn't work and he annihilates them all with a single swipe of his hand.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em> do this a <em>lot</em>. Mind you, part of this could be because their superiors might not have fully informed them about the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> of the diclonius. Also, since they have to deflect every individual bullet, it's theoretically possible for one to get through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as shown by the sniper that managed to nail Lucy in the head</span>.
<p></p></li><li> Zig-zaggy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAO">Eureka Seven AO</a></em>. The G-Monsters have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">some kind of energy field</a> that makes them immune to non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">mecha</a> weapons. Sometimes the military listens to Bleu's warnings and holds their fire, but other times they cluelessly shoot at the monsters, which merely draws their attention and gets the shooter(s) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">obliterated</a>. In one episode they try to <em>capture</em> one of the monsters, with predictable results. Pied Piper's AI <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> their stupidity at least once.
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> has this trope in spades. Generally, if the character being shot or attacked <em>isn't</em> an important member of the cast (or the episode's main mook), they won't be hurt too badly. If you're a standard mook, you can expect to die pretty quickly. Played straight during Kenshiro's introduction to Bat and Lin. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a>-ing his way through a falling building, a Mook shoots him in the chest with a crossbow. Kenshiro merely looks down, rips out the arrow and throws it away.
<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em>, when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceisBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceisBad">scientist</a> fires multiple rounds at what he was just told was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an army of</span> immortal beings.
<ul><li> You have to feel sorry for Hawkeye: despite her being the badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger">gunslinger</a> of the series, the main scenes in which she gets to show off her skills are against Homunculi who have more power to regenerate themselves than she has ammo.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in another story, where a group of train robbers keeps encountering Al one-by-one and deciding that firing their machineguns at the big suit of armor is a good idea, DESPITE Al attempting to warn them. As it wears on, Anime!Al just keeps trying, while Manga!Al is a little more snarky (in the sense of "It worked out so well for your three friends...").
</li><li> Turns out to ultimately be subverted with the homunculi. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> they display initially make it look like shooting them is futile, but the ability to regenerate is powered by their Philosopher's Stones, which have a finite amount of energy. The result is that even if bullets don't look like they do anything, they still use up some of the Philosopher's Stone's power, it's just that other forms of attack obviously work better.

<ul><li> Alucard, pretty much all the time. Even enemies who know he's an immortal vampire still try. Though they may imagine they have a chance of slowing him down, it's likely that all the drama surrounding his regeneration is purely for his amusement.
<div class="indent"><strong>Alucard:</strong> You'll need more than guns to stop me!

<p></p></li><li> The <em>Mazinger</em> series: Whenever a human army turns on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em>, they always shot round after of round of ammo in spite of they should already know conventional weaponry not even scratches them. (It was kind of subverted the first time Mazinger-Z was activated in the manga. The army could not know what that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> was made of. And in that time, the dome that should be protecting Kouji inside the cockpit was still open, so the pilot was still vulnerable. Shooting Superman in that situation could have worked.) Also, when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Robeast</a> appears, the army insists on attacking them in spite of they should know after the first few times they are wasting ammo, men and money. It was kind of subverted in a <em>Mazinger-Z</em> episode, though: a squad of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Iron Masks</a> surrounded Aphrodite-A and threw a hail of spears against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemBot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemBot">Fem Bot</a>. They very obviously did not damage it, but they managed to slow Sayaka down (they were so many they were very distracting) what was their intention.
<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, after the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> cripples his own mech, Admiral Dozel climbs out of the cockpit &amp; begins shooting at it with a rifle. This is more a final symbolic act of defiance, though.
<ul><li> Funny thing is, Dozel's Mobile Armour, the Big Zam (no, there is no Small Zam), is the target of this just a few moments earlier. With a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> barrier called an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics">I-Field Barrier</a> that can block all beam attacks even from capital ships main guns, he just flies around and slaughtered dozens of Space Cruisers and Battleships along with its 28 beam guns mounted all over and with auto lock on capability. Thus it takes the sacrifice of a comrade so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> can get in close and stab the Mobile Armour with a beam sabre.
<ul><li> Though the I-Field Generator on the Big Zam can only last for 20 mins and cannot block solid ammunition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> More along the lines of the trope: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0080WarInThePocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0080WarInThePocket">Gundam 0080</a></em> demonstrates that even a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a> piloted by a rookie can do significant damage to a Gundam if they use strategy and tactics. However, more often than not the enemy will just fire blindly and get trashed, with the Gundam receiving only light damage at worst.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. It's established that all conventional weapons are useless against the angels and even the "Non-nuclear" N2 mines may or may not slow one down, depending on the episode and angel. The JSDF and NERV always shoot them anyway, but over time, it goes from foolish pride to a quite deliberate attempt to feel out a new threat's capabilities before they send in the Evas (because no two Angels are exactly alike, and all of them are full of nasty surprises).
<ul><li> Some lines from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> suggest that the military stubbornly insists on having their shot at killing an Angel to feel satisfied. Ritsuko quips that the only thing they're doing is wasting money. There are, however, some occasions where NERV fires huge amounts of ordinance at an Angel to distract it or slow it down while they get the Evas ready.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Considering he has a one and a half billion beli bounty and is one of the most infamous pirates in the world, you'd think people would know better than to try shooting at Luffy. It's not like he hides the fact that he's made of rubber, either. Bullets that hit him tend to bounce right back at the same speed they hit him at while he just ignores them. It's particularly bad during Enies Lobby when literally thousands of marines are trying to shoot him and he doesn't even seem to notice. Maybe they're aiming for his oddly indestructible hat to go for emotional damage?
</li><li> It gets even worse in the Marineford Arc. After Luffy freed Ace, the Marines proceed to shoot Luffy <em>and</em> Ace. Keep in mind that Ace can turn into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">intangible</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">fire</a></em>, so while bullets just bounce off Luffy, they simply pass through Ace. (Some of the Marines seem to notice this during the arc and how the sheer number of superhuman combatants means all they're going to do is add more dead bodies, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">Akainu</a> kills any who does, so it is either the pirates, or him.)
</li><li> The worst may have been the jailers in the previous arc; when Luffy briefly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">allies himself with Crocodile and Jimbei</a>, the jailers open fire on Crocodile. (Not only are bullets ineffective against this guy as he can turn himself to sand, he was originally intended to be the main antagonist of the entire franchise, back when it was only supposed to last five years; he has the reputation deserving of one of the cruelest men in Impel Down.) Crocodile simply grins at them in amusement with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a> while smoking his cigar as the bullets harmlessly pass through him for a minute or two, <em>then</em> he proceeds to cut them down.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted to high hell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePieceFilmZ">One Piece Film: Z</a></em>. The main villain, former admiral Z, first shoots Luffy with a regular gun; Luffy, predictably, does his usual "bullets can't hurt me!" boasting... which gives Z enough time to whip out a revolver loaded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">sea-stone bullets</a> and shoot him with it. Naturally, Luffy quickly loses his strength and eventually can no longer even move with the sea-stone lodged in his shoulder and collapses, while Z chuckles at his arrogance.</span>
</li><li> It should be noted that when bullets do work they are very effective. Even among elite pirates there aren't many who have an ability which let's them outright block bullets causing many to dodge or deflect them and run for cover rather than tank them and risk severe injury. This would explain why marines keep trying it even though to the viewer it seems silly.

</li><li> During Ainz' battle with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shalltear</span>, he tanks both holy and fire attacks (both of which he's weak to as an undead, but his usual gear resists fire).

However, most people dont actually know how durable he is because, well, guns dont work underwater so he almost never gets shot. Therefore, some people do try and are pretty shocked to see the bullets just glance off him.

<p></p></li><li> Oddly enough Batman has also been known to subvert and avert this trope as well as play it straight.

This being their first meeting he does not realize that she has super strength and super durability and he predictably ends up breaking his knuckles. However, he then quickly adapts with a significantly more effective kick to her diaphragm, deducing that even though she's super strong she still needs air.

Rather than trying to hurt Amazo with regular punches and weapons, he strikes exclusively with explosives and high momentum strikes to major weak points, e.g. a flying knee to the underside of the chin and plastique to the eyes.

What do you want me to do next, shove Mother Teresa in a gas chamber?" Didn't help that the JLA also had a (bulletproof) angel on their side at the time. The general had to tell his soldiers that the angel was "fallen" (sort of true but not the way they're implying). Subverted a few issues later, when several supervillains stage a prison break. Even though they are pretty successful (some stop rioting out of fear of Batman), they all stop immediately after Superman arrives. They just give up and go back to their cells.

The most egregious example has to be the opening, where Ross sends in a special forces team that has not been prepped on the existence of the Hulk. When Banner is cornered and the inevitable happens, we get a close up view of the tranquilizer darts they've been equipped with shattering on the Hulk's skin. The finale of the film also has General Ross attempting to "<em>cut (the Abomination) in half</em>" with a .50 caliber machine gun, despite the fact that it shrugged off a hit from a bazooka.

One of them finally has the presence of mind to load a .50 Browning fixed machine gun, and even the luck to disable the actuator on his right leg. He still ends up dead from flamethrower and multiple explosions. You can at least understand the guy who shot Tony in the head's line of thinking. He was going for a hopeful weak spot.

<ul><li> Generally speaking, there is no point in shooting at RoboCop with anything less than anti-tank weaponry. Of course this makes RoboCop's eventual fall all the more shocking. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2">RoboCop 2</a></em>, RoboCop does this when shooting atRoboCop II, as his replacement is even more heavily armored than he is. Noticing that doesn't work, even with big gun he's using, he at least shoots off his replacement's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoulderCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoulderCannon">Shoulder Cannon</a> since it fired explosive bullets. RoboCop II notices that the minigun it was using was useless in the fight so he resorted to using his hands.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop3">RoboCop 3</a></em>, someone does have the bright idea that shooting RoboCop in the mouth would work, since its the only part of him not covered in armor. However, by this point, RoboCop is such an in-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> that some people think that he EATS bullets, and when he confronts the thugs in question, he's got them so panicked by his approach that the thug with the gun can't shoot at the approaching cyborg, and ultimately drops his weapon. It probably helped that RoboCop was ON FIRE at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> A non-human example pops up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan">Saving Private Ryan</a></em>, where a critically wounded character fires his pistol at an approaching tank, since there's nothing else he can do.

(2019)</a></em>, Billy learns that he's bulletproof after a robber tries shooting him. He and Freddy are so excited by this discovery that they <em>actually order</em> the robbers to keep shooting him. Which they duly do until they run out of bullets.
</li><li> The battle droids and their ilk in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> prequel trilogy just can't get enough of shooting their blasters at Jedi — who routinely deflect the relatively slow blasts away with their super-reflexes and lightsabres, often right back at the shooter. Of course, it's not like they have any better alternative. It does work sometimes, mostly when having an overwhelming advantage and not targeting main characters. Jango Fett manages to shoot a nameless Jedi knight (but has no luck against Mace Windu) in episode II, and overwhelming numbers of clone troopers successfully attack the Jedi temple in episode III, while at the same time a number of surprised Jedi around the galaxy are killed by their own troopers who suddenly turn on them. But normally, the average mook can never realistically expect such an outcome.
<ul><li> The original trilogy depicts fighters attacking large ships as this, when in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> a transport being sent out with only a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">X-Wings</a> to protect it against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip">Star Destroyer</a> doesn't get much confidence from the pilots until it's brought up that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">giant Ion Cannon</a> will be covering them.
</li></ul></li><li> The platoon protecting the president in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII">Superman II</a></em> does this with the Krypton Criminals. They empty their clips into General Zod and company, and when the bullets all bounce off harmlessly, they <em>reload</em> and shoot at the three Kryptonians some more.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em>, a criminal turns a freaking <em>Gatling gun</em> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">not just the usual 7.62mm minigun - this was a full-on 20mm M61</a>!) on Superman. Even after he's emptied an entire belt of high-powered ammunition into the guy's chest without so much as scuffing the insignia, he still thinks it's a bright idea to move on to a regular pistol and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye">try to shoot for Superman's eyes</a>. We're then treated to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a> effect of the bullet actually <em>bouncing off Superman's eyeball</em>. Golly. Superman takes a moment to flash a sardonic, "how dumb can you get?" smile at the thug just before giving him great quantities of what-for. <em>Offscreen</em>, however. Admittedly, it was a valiant effort by the mook, at least trying for what would seemingly be an obvious weak spot. It's not exactly like Superman's exact abilities and limits are well documented and published in that universe, and remember, even the mighty Achilles had a heel.
</li><li> Played straight in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em> films.

Basically, Oliver is simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">better prepared</a>. Later, Oliver even manages to hit MitYS with arrows, although, once again, the element of surprise is involved.

</li><li> Later on, Vandal Savage manages to hit Barry with a thrown blade, but that's only because he throws a <em>lot</em> very fast at Barry's friends, forcing Barry to be more worried about them than his own safety. Besides, Savage had centuries to practice his skills.
</li><li> On Earth-3, their version of the Trickster empties the clip of his submachinegun at Jay Garrick only for Garrick to catch them all with his helmet (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taken from Zoom</span>). However, the Trickster had one more, well, trick up his sleeve and revealed that he was strapped with a bomb about to go off. Luckily, Barry arrives and disarms the bomb in a matter of seconds.

When a secret agent pulls a gun on Superman, he just smiles sympathetically and says, "Let me guess, you're new in town." In another episode, Lex Luthor's ex-wife points a gun at Superman and he says he thought she was smarter than that. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">It turns out she's smart enough to use a bullet made of Kryptonite</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlindness">but not enough to make sure nobody would remove the bullet before its radiation kills Superman</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserArchetype">Al Bundy</a> hilariously lampshades this trope in a later episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>, while watching what was most likely an episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">the George Reeves TV series</a>. He observes, "The bad guys shoot Superman a dozen times, see the bullets bounce off, so they throw their guns at him. It's like they can't kill him, so they think they'd give him a really bad bruise! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What a bunch of morons!"</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceOfSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceOfSpace">Prince of Space</a></em>, the villainous aliens constantly attack the eponymous hero with their laser weapons, despite his constant insistence that these weapons cannot harm him. And yet he continues dodging them anyway, because his "immunity" to their weapons is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">an invention of the English dub</a>. In the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseLanguage">Japanese Language</a> cut, he was just really good at evading gunfire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>: Occasionally trotted out in, particularly in "Exile," where Clark (infected with red kryptonite) robs a bank. When the cops get there, Clark pretends to go for a gun, and they shoot him. A lot. He just stands there for a while before getting bored and using heat vision to blow up a cop car. Although Clark seems to enjoy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletCatch">snatching bullets out of the air and showing them to look extra badass</a>. Subverted in "Extinction." Clark hears someone shooting at him and turns to catch the bullet. He's visibly shocked when the kryptonite round goes through his hand and into his shoulder. Justified a lot, as a lot of criminals shoot at Clark, not knowing he's invulnerable. Also, in season one this trope would be played with, as Clark was only just developing his invulnerability, so he would be as surprised as the villains when this didn't work. For example, in "Pilot" he is surprised (and a bit scared) when he survives being hit by Lex's car, and in the episode "Hug" a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> Lex tries to kill Clark with an automatic rifle, and both Clark and his parents are shocked to learn he can survive automatic weapon fire.
</li><li> While more technology than invulnerability, when going up against one of the Goa'uld in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, the team unloads rounds of gunfire towards him, only to be deflected by the shield. Jack O'Neill then throws a blade (not the gun he was just firing, that would have probably fallen far short), which penetrates the shield.
<ul><li> This is explained in show- certain kinds of personal shield can be penetrated by slow-moving objects. Useless shooting seems to be SGC standard procedure for dealing with both Kull warriors and human-form Replicators, both of whom are completely immune to bullets. It's possible that the bullet-shooters are trying to act as distractions for whoever has the gun that will actually kill the enemy, though.
</li><li> There is a straighter example in the episode where Teal'c is trapped in the virtual reality of the chair. The setting is an invasion by a Kull Warrior of Anubis. The military personnel keeps firing on it with ordinary weaponry (instead of doing something smart like evacuating or trapping the Kull Warrior in a corridor), completely ignoring the fact that the Kull Warrior can only killed by a special weapon. <em>This includes O'Neill himself</em>. For all its trying to be realistic, the program apparently makes its friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">AIs</a> incredibly stupid.
</li><li> Too many Jaffa (and sometimes even SGC personnel) seem to forget that energy-based weapons can't work on Replicators, and they need to use bullets. (Especially after it being proven that the P90 is better than the staff weapon at everything besides melee and intimidation.)
<ul><li> Staff weapons do work on Replicators (unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGuns">Zats</a>), but they're too imprecise for most warriors to have a shot at hitting a fast-moving target like a Replicator. Only someone as well-trained as Teal'c or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Bra'tac</a> can do so reliably (Teal'c once manages to hit a Replicator with a staff weapon without even looking).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">Supergirl (2015)</a></em>:
<ul><li> This naturally happens to the title character, despite the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">her cousin</a> is already a well-known superhero in this 'verse. When Superman shows up, sure enough, a pair of bank robbers are dumb enough to shoot him too, and one tries to punch him too. Clark is amused.
<div class="indent"><strong>Superman:</strong> Now, see, if the bullets don't work, right...why the punching? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Never understood that.</a>
</div></li><li> Subverted in a later episode when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> confronts some robbers. Just as she scoffs about one aiming an ordinary gun at her, the other guy unleashes an electrical blast that knocks her back.
</li></ul></li><li> As mentioned in the Trope description, this initially came from the old live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> movie serials and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">the George Reeves TV series</a>. Superman would confront a crook, the crook would shoot at Superman, who stood there with his fists on his hips while the bullets bounced off his invulnerable skin. Then the crook would <em>throw</em> the now-empty gun at Superman, who would <em>duck</em> or <em>dodge</em> it. Of course, the real reason for this was that the "ricochet" effects were drawn onto the celluloid film stock after the fact, and the actors playing Superman <em>had</em> to duck so as not to get cracked in the head with a prop gun. Still, it does look quite silly Later seasons, someone must have noticed and came up with having the mooks throw rubber or foam guns at Reeves so that they'd bounce off his padded chest. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> version occurs in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheAdventuresOfSupermanS1E19TheEvilThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheAdventuresOfSupermanS1E19TheEvilThree">The Evil Three</a>"; one of the villains tries to kill Superman with his sword, but he's unaware Superman is invulnerable.
<ul><li> It COULD make sense that Superman attempted to dodge the empty gun, to prevent said gun from ricocheting and hitting a bystander.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> using bullets or guns are generally completely useless. There can be exceptions such as the Colt and how various beings aren't immune to specific types of bullets, there are beings immune to both. However in situations where bullets do not work it is usually when the shooter is not aware they won't work.
</li><li> Back and forth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a></em>. When dealing with Terminators, small arms fire generally doesn't do much more than annoy them, and when the main characters use them it's either to slow them down or as a way to distract them, although in great quantities, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> sometimes does have an effect. The only small arms that do have a reliable effect are shotgun slugs, special armor-piercing rounds, and high explosives. Of course, characters that don't know what they're fighting will frequently and continuously spray a Terminator with bullets even after they see how useless it is.
</li><li> Often played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975">Wonder Woman (1975)</a></em>, thus giving Wonder Woman a chance to do her "bullets and bracelets" stunt. Hilariously subverted in the pilot, however, where Red Buttons plays a shady showbiz promoter working for the Nazis. Wonder Woman tracks down the Nazi agents, most of whom have yet to encounter her. Understandably, they therefore open fire at the strange chick in the bathing suit, with predictable results. Buttons' character, however, previously saw Wonder Woman deflect an entire magazine from a <em>machine gun</em>. He does unload his revolver at Wonder Woman, but doesn't even bother aiming, with an expression on his face that clearly shows he's just shooting for appearance's sake.
</li><li> The final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> has a heroic version: Doggett <em>always</em> tries to shoot the completely invulnerable Super Soldiers no matter how many times it doesn't work. Eventually one of them calls him on it. Doggett, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">the skeptic</a>, presumably does not believe in the Super Soldiers or their invulnerability. He probably assumes that, despite being an FBI agent who is probably a pretty good shot, he's just been missing them all this time. Technically, they can be killed, but that requires one to be a <em>very</em> good shot and hit them right at the base of the neck right behind the jaw.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Definitely used against the player characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em>. Many of the monsters are horrifically powerful and have defenses which no player character can realistically hope to break. And if the near-impossible happens and you somehow defeat an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> by, say, ramming it in the head with a ship, it usually has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> which means it will survive. Guns are useful only against the weakest Mythos creatures and cultists. And yourself. And whoever got you into this mess.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> RPG has a rule for players who end up doing this. If a player spends more than one fate point on an attack on an enemy that turns out to be invulnerable to that attack, they get all but one fate point back.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> - and many other role-playing-games - in which literally any attack will hurt literally anyone as long as the attacker rolls a 20 on a 20-sided die (or a similarly rare optimal roll in games that use different dice for resolution). For example, D&amp;D rules permits 1 in 20 attacks to hit a high AC target, where 10 thugs empty out revolvers at Superman, an average three of those shots will qualify as a hit.
<ul><li> Going by D&amp;D rules, Superman would likely have a huge Damage Reduction (which a natural 20 does not nullify), rendering them just as ineffective as before. Furthermore, such high defenses would make it impossible to land a critical hit, resulting in no damage.
</li><li> Some more amorphous entities, like golems or the undead, are immune to critical hits. Since crits are supposed to represent getting a lucky hit through your target's defenses or directly in a weak spot, this obviously wouldn't apply to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> that doesn't stop short of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">Critical Existence Failure</a>. Creatures immune to such critical hits are just treated as receiving normal damage.
</li><li> This can happen with magic as well. Golems can only be affected by a tiny assortment of spells, and sometimes a creature has a quality which allows it a level-based chance to ignore a magical attack. A caster might have a zero-percent chance to affect an enemy. A spell caster can overcome this by using magic creatively, for example, disintegrating the bridge a golem is walking across rather than targeting the golem itself.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroClix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroClix">HeroClix</a></em>, a roll of double sixes is a "Critical Hit" — it automatically hits regardless of what number you actually needed to roll, and deals one extra damage that can't be mitigated by defense powers. So, if you're suitably desperate, there's really no reason for your hapless mook to <em>not</em> take a swing at Galactus. Maybe you'll get that 12.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em>: the Superman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> Legacy has the Fortitude card used to reduce damage taken, which depicts him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No Selling</a> a hail of bullets.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> and possible but uncommon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. In the older editions of the later, if a unit's toughness stat is four points higher than the strength of an attack thrown at it, the attack can't hurt it. In the former, any unit can be harmed by a hit if the attacker rolls a six on a six-sided dice to wound, and no matter what, armor has a minimum 1 in 6 chance to fail. After all saves, any attack has at least a tiny chance to hurt the enemy. Interestingly, the current editions actually favor a big group of Mooks attacking a single powerful unit, since not do their mass of attacks and numbers mean they can beat it a battle of attrition, but they get automatic bonuses to their combat resolution meaning they can win without inflicting any harm on target.
<ul><li> Prior editions of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> did not allow troops to flee close combat from an enemy they have no chance in heck of hurting, meaning that the squad would refuse to try to flee an unwinnable combat and be locked in that fight until slaughtered or their morale broke and they fled. So if your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">Red Shirt Army</a> Imperial Guardsmen - basically normal guys - were in close combat with a walking death tank they could not damage, they would continue to beat it with the stocks of their rifles for no damage until they were killed or their morale was broken. 6th Edition (current as of early 2013) allows tropes to <em>choose</em> to flee if they have exactly zero chance to damage an enemy in close combat. In either case, they have a chance to be swept off the table when they flee.
<ul><li> Additionally, in 6th edition, a unit can charge a unit which they have zero chance to injure. This might be worthwhile if tying up the enemy in close combat is more important than whatever lambs are being sent to slaughter.
</li><li> Of course, this is all fully in keeping with the usual tactics of the Imperial Guard, who tend to operate on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>. Depending on the story, this can be portrayed as callous and stupid commanders sending people needlessly to their deaths, heroism in the face of insurmountable odds when surrender would mean death or worse anyway, or good strategy where weak attacks may appear ineffective to being with but ultimately prevail as long as you have enough millions of men to throw into the fight (or are just a distraction until the overwhelming artillery and armour roll in).
</li><li> Orks also tend to use the same sort of tactics, in their case simply because they enjoy fighting above all else. Your enemy may be completely invulnerable to everything you can hit it with, but hey, at least you're having fun hitting it.
</li><li> When it comes to Warhammer, always specify which edition because things change. As of eighth edition Warhammer 40,000, and Age of Sigmar, this trope is Averted. Enough flea bites will down anything, as any attack has at a minimum a 1 in 6 chance to hit, a 1 in 6 chance to wound, and the enemy will fail to save 1 time in 6 at worst, doing one damage. It may statistically take thousands of shots, but it can happen with enough chances. We will see what happens in 9th Edition and in future Age of Sigmar products.
</li></ul></li><li> In the associated Warhammer 40,000 RPGS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader">Rogue Trader</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deathwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deathwatch">Deathwatch</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlackCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlackCrusade">Black Crusade</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OnlyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OnlyWar">Only War</a></em>, this can happen to the player characters or to the mooks. Many supernatural creatures, technologically advanced aliens, particularly wealthy and important Imperial citizens, and Space Marines are simply immune to the weapons available to flunkies by virtue of armor, force fields, and/or superhuman toughness. Since these things exist in one continuity, it is entirely possible for the players or the enemies to unload lasgun shot after lasgun shot with no chance to do damage at all.

</li><li> In various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games, the AI enemies will always attack one of your characters should someone be within range, regardless of their own accuracy against said character or whether or not they can inflict any damage at all. This can easily be played around with, allowing you to place a unit with insanely high defense in the way and allowing the enemy to repeatedly attack you, while you counterattack and your weaker characters are safely too far away/blocked off.

When asked how he would kill a Jedi, the start of his response is as follows: <em>"Weapon selection is critical. If I see one more idiot attacking a Jedi with a blaster pistol, I'll kill them myself!"</em>. He then goes on to name a number of tactics and weapons that could be much more effective than a gun if used creatively: land mines, grenades, painfully loud noise weapons, sniping, taking friends and loved ones hostage, etc. (Full scene <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPeI4mX8Nus">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.) In-game however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">blasters are still effective against Jedi and Sith</a>, only less so than against other characters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOBatman">LEGO Batman 2</a></em>, certain characters such as Superman and Wonder Woman are completely immune to all damage. This doesn't stop everyone from random street thugs to evil genius Lex Luthor trying to kill them.
</li><li> In the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechAssault">MechAssault</a></em> games, infantry will attack your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">BattleMech</a> with their rifles to no avail until you crush them with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFootOfStomping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFootOfStomping">Giant Foot of Stomping</a>. In <em>MechWarrior Living Legends</em>, the default weapon for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">BattleArmor</a> does almost no damage to tanks or mechs, but battlearmor players can use it to piss off mech pilots by spraying the cockpit with it to blind them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletSparks">Bullet Sparks</a> and prevent them from transferring C-Bills to their allies.
</li><li> In the Generation 1 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> games, this could be the case. Because of the programming, trainers would <em>always</em> use attacks super effective against your Pokemon's type...even if your Pokemon's <em>other</em> type was immune, and even if the "attack" isn't actually an attack, such as using Amnesia relentlessly against Fighting Pokemon. As such, one could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker">sweep through the entire Celadon Gym</a> with a Level 5 Bulbasaur because every trainer, seeing that he is Grass type, would use Poisonpowder every turn, despite the fact that his Poison half makes him immune to the attack. Generation VI introduces the grass starters final form Chesnaught who's hidden ability Bulletproof makes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">immune to any bullet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">or bomb based moves</a>. The AI will occasionally ignore this fact even after several applications of a move it is immune to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>:
<ul><li> As Alex Mercer succinctly puts it: "Nothing can protect you from me! Not men! Not weapons! Not armor!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">When Alex Mercer shows up</a>, shooting is pretty much your only recourse. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Running won't work either</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">nor will surrender</a>. All tanks do is irritate him by knocking him over, he'll just hijack your helicopter — unless, of course, he decides to smash your tank in one blow and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">throw it</a></em> at the chopper — and bullets might as well be Nerf darts. Hell, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">survives</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">a nuke to the face</a></span>. While bullets are able to hurt you, the damage they deal is not significant unless you just stand there and let them shoot you.
</li><li> And then, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2">[PROTOTYPE 2]</a></em>, this gets extended even further. Heller can acquire a passive power that works like Alex's shield, so anyone trying to shoot him with small arms will get killed by ricochets with no effort on his part. Heller then gets a shield that's improved over Alex's - it not only covers him completely, but it'll reflect tank rounds and rockets as well. Heller himself does this at the start of the game, when he decides he's going to try to <em>stab</em> Mercer to death.
<ul><li> Upgrading Heller's defensive ability will render him completely immune to small arms fire. Explosives will still hurt though.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> downplays this with two of the available <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Breaks</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">The Bubbler</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">the Kraken</a> make their users temporarily invincible, and instead all damage sources make them suffer knockback. With a weapon that has the fire rate to support it (and outranges the opponent's in the case of the Bubbler) it's possible to keep them at bay, or even knock them out-of-bounds into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">water</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pit</a>, by firing at them.
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> series: Grabbing a star makes you immune to damage, knock-back, and hitstun, and all the CPU players will avoid you to the best of their ability rather than waste their time attacking. Some <em>human</em> players, however, have a hard time figuring that out.
</li><li> <em>Superman: Shadow of Apokalips</em> has an example that, oddly enough, does not involve Superman. When Metallo comes gunning for Lex Luthor, Luthor's big plan is to have his bodyguard Mercy shoot Metallo with a machine gun. This isn't meant to distract Metallo so that Luthor can escape or anything like that, Luthor genuinely seemed to think this would work and had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> reaction when it didn't. What makes this worse is that in this continuity, Luthor was the one responsible for turning Metallo into a cyborg, would know exactly how tough he is, and has access to energy weapons powerful enough to hurt him. But no, just have Mercy use a machine gun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Regular Ubercharges are indestructible. You will accomplish absolutely nothing by blazing away with that shotgun at the Medic while that glowing blue Russian force of minigun-wielding death incarnate shoots you to bits with his much, much more effective minigun. Doesn't stop people from trying, though, God bless 'em. However, stronger weapons can slow down the Ubercharged pair, and weapons with knockback ability like explosives or Pyro's airblast can knock them around the air, potentially separating the Medic from his patient, or knocking one of them into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pit</a>, so people with those weapons can give it a shot, even if it's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">try to distract them while your Medics and Engineers run for it</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurretMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurretMaster">Sentries</a>, notably, also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">tend to auto-target Ubercharged enemies</a> - while not a useless tactic, since sentries have good knockback, it's pretty close, especially when less-invulnerable targets are walking around.
</li><li> Downplayed with the Quickfix medigun's Ubercharge. It doesn't make the Medic and his patient invincible, but instead VERY rapidly heals them. Things that kill in a single shot (sniper rifle headshots, crit rockets), enough stickies, or simply enough concentrated firepower to overwhelm the overheal can still finish them off, so shooting them is still a smart idea. Although if all you have is a shotgun, it is still a better idea to run for it.
</li><li> Bonk Atomic Punch is invincibility in a can (though you trade your ability to attack while active), but like with ubercharges Scout is still vulnerable to knockback while under its effects. Any damage blocked by the drink will temporarily slow the Scout after the effects end, so shooting him isn't a complete waste of time, if there's nothing else to shoot at. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/JQhComn-xHA?t=459">Before that effect was added, though, smart players averted this trope by ignoring Bonked Scouts completely<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Similarly, it's impossible to directly target magic-immune units with spells. It is, however, possible to uselessly cast area effect spells on them.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> we get (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity">the entirety of</a>) a flashback to events before the game, which features Sho Minamimoto shooting at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joshua</span>. This cutscene takes place in the RG, where Sho is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a> and assumes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joshua</span> is too, so his first shot is justified because he doesn't know that his target is capable of stopping the bullet in mid-flight. However, after said bullet stops, Sho <em>empties the rest of his chambers</em> in Joshua's direction, which falls firmly into this trope.
</li><li> The number of players who try in vain to shoot at the front of a T95 or T110E3 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em> is mind-boggling. They are both known for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a> in their respective tiers—slow, but well armed and almost impossible to kill head-on, thanks to the foot-thick slab of steel mounted on the front of the tank. Any tank with insufficient penetration power is simply going to end up bouncing round after round off these things. A well positioned T95 can cause even FV215b (183) shells—usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> to lesser tanks—to just glance off its thick armor plating.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> where enemies will not attack an invincible player if there are other players to attack.

<ul><li> In the 1941 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons">Fleischer Superman cartoon</a> <em>Billion Dollar Limited</em>. train-hijackers start out by shooting Superman. Fair enough, naturally it doesn't work. Then they start tossing tear-gas grenades at him. Since Supes hadn't yet gained Super Breath or the like in his power set, they work surprisingly well. <em>THEN</em> they go back to shooting at him again. Sigh.
<ul><li> In another cartoon, "Showdown", a crook posing as Superman comes face to face with the real deal. He empties his gun on Supes, but of course the bullets bounce off his chest. The crook then throws his empty gun at him, and Superman doesn't even flinch as it too bounces off harmlessly.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 60's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderMan1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderMan1967">Spider-Man</a></em> cartoon, Doctor Octopus throws Spider-Man out of a window and promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">declares him dead</a>, before Spider-Man immediately returns through the same window.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>, the protagonist often forgets that Barry Dylan is a bulletproof cyborg, usually with an immediate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>.
</li><li> Queen Veranke remarkably subverts this trope when attacking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em>. After she took down the former with a big gun, Iron Man points out she will only hurt herself more than him if she shoots at him. She answers that she knows... and then reveals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">she already had a virus uploaded inside his armor, thus incapacitating him without a shot</a>.

And if they can avoid getting beaten up, they will. Bat-Mite, however, has other plans for them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ben becomes aware of this trope in subsequent fights with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Vilgax</a> and mostly runs from him or relies on tricks to defeat him rather than fighting him head on since Vilgax is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> This happens rather frequently throughout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a>, as the different shows feature many heroes that are immune to one attack or another, including the eponymous Superman:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> Towards the beginning S:TAS, when people are still getting used to what Superman can do, he stops a museum heist in "A Little Piece of Home." When he appears, the thieves start throwing <em>spears</em> at him, grabbing them off the displays and hurling with all their might. The thieves do manage to escape the museum, since Kryptonite made its first appearance and conveniently knocked Superman out, but the hand-thrown weapons worked about as well as you would expect.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS3E8SupermansPal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS3E8SupermansPal">Superman's Pal</a>" a thug who was attacking Jimmy Olsen actually attacks Superman <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">with a nightstick</a></em>. Supes simply snatches it off him saying "You're kidding, right?" before flinging it into orbit.
</li><li> In the next episode, "A Fish Story", Superman is drawn by the sound of gunfire to two of Lex Luthor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> who are trying to kill Lois Lane. They promptly turn their guns on Superman and start pulling the trigger. He waits for a few seconds as they waste their ammo, then reaches forward and <em>crushes their guns</em>, explaining that "That's enough."
</li><li> In the episode "My Girl", one of Lex Luthor's lackeys is selling a bunch of futuristic guns that can make anything explode to a couple of crooks when Superman suddenly shows up. The crooks shoot Superman...and nothing happens. After Supes incapacitates the crooks, the lackey points the gun at him only for the latter to say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">I should warn you: it's been done</a>." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The lackey then spots a train in the distance heading towards a bridge and shoots said bridge forcing Superman to save the train while he gets away.</span>
</li><li> There's one hilarious instance where a mook is threatening Superman with a gun that he boasts <em>can</em> kill him - instead of pulling the trigger, the mook <em>gloats</em> about how he can kill Superman with the futuristic raygun. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What an Idiot!</a>.
</li><li> This trope wasn't limited to Superman himself in this series, in "The Way of All Flesh", we have the police shooting at Metallo, after he had walked in front of train and stopped with his hands without getting so much as a scratch on him. Superman himself, desperate enough to try anything due to Metallo's kryptonite power source, resorts to something along these lines by ramming Metallo with a car, which does at least push him off the highway bridge they were fighting on, though it doesn't hurt him.
</li><li> Turns up in "The Late Mr. Kent" when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> tries to fight Superman off with the armaments of an attack helicopter. The cannon and missile fire is enough to knock Supes around a bit, but ultimately doesn't stop him. Could be legitimately justified as desperation, since the bad guy knows his role in killing/trying to kill several people has just been exposed. Letting Superman haul him in means the death penalty, so that may explain why he keeps the firing button mashed despite nothing working.
</li><li> In "Tools of the Trade", Darkseid's agent Kanto provides Bruno Mannheim and his gang with weapons that <em>can</em> hurt Superman. In the end, Bruno zaps Superman with a raygun that cripples him with pain, but then foolishly gloats about how he can kill him now for several seconds, buying enough time for Dan Turpin to tackle him before he can fire again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> Unlimited</em>:
<ul><li> In "Hawk and Dove", a thug empties his gun at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, who <em>contemptuously</em> deflects all the rounds. When he runs out of bullets he prepares to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowawayGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowawayGuns">throw the gun at her</a> and earns a contemptuous, "Yeah, like <em>that's</em> gonna work."
</li><li> Supergirl is at one point threatened by a man with a single-shot kryptonite gun which probably could kill her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> intervenes by standing between them, leaving his only option to waste the shot on an ordinary human while leaving a pissed off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> unharmed. Later on, Galatea confronts the man and casually disarms him before he even has a chance to fire.
</li><li> In "Ultimatum", an unstable metahuman with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">hydrokinetic abilities</a> tries to kill Aquaman after he harms his sister; however, his method is to try to <em>drown</em> him with a jet of water. Granted the blast was powerful enough to punch a huge hole in the wall behind him, but Aquaman stands unaffected: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeaJobforAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeaJobforAquaman">"King of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">the Seas,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">remember?"</a> The meta refuses to relent and tries a few swings; gets kinda sad after that.
</li><li> Another Wonder Woman example: In '"The Once and Future Thing, Part I", Green Lantern, Batman and Wonder Woman are transported back in time to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a>, whereupon they are immediately ambushed by local bandits. Since they obviously refuse to part with their valuables, a couple of bandits with period revolvers shoot at Wonder Woman. She simply smirks as she bats the shots aside effortlessly, commenting, "Those are the biggest, <em>slowest</em> bullets I've ever seen."
</li><li> Lampshaded (and justified) in "Hereafter" by a pair of police officers as they lament the useless of their guns against a group of supervillains during Superman's absence :

He yells "No!" and throws his gavel at Guts Man, who is completely unphased and replies with a resounding "Yes!"
<p></p></li><li> As part of a plan to steal Olive Oyl's heart, Bluto disguises himself as Superman and uses several tricks to make it look like he had Supes' powers. That includes wearing a metal plate under his costume and daring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a> to shoot him. As part of the Popeye vs. Bluto/Superman challenge, Bluto gets to shoot Popeye back but the bullets are stopped by Popeye's can of spinach, which he then opens and eats.

Naturally the robbers open fire on them to no effect. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe">To be fair, the girls durability is very inconsistent. Some episodes they take getting sent through a building with no major injuries, and other times getting hit by an ordinary human can hurt them.</a>
</li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>:
<ul><li> Red Skull is firing a machine gun at Captain America, who is clearly bored as he simply lets the shots bounce off his shield...unfortunately, all the ricocheting bullets are hitting civilians.
</li><li> In the first <em>DC Comics Special</em> Superman simply laughs off a robber's attempts at shooting him with a machine gun ("Haha, that tickles!"). The robber <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">starts shooting at Superman's crotch</a> (the bullets continuing to bounce off anyway), much to Supe's confusion ("What, uh, what's going on here?").

He shoots Bart (with a laser!) who manages to dodge every shot. In a subversion though, when he throws the gun, it hits Bart and knocks him out.
</li><li> Parodied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> where Butters, as Professor Chaos, is fighting Mysterion on a construction platform. One of the officers says he has a clean shot of Professor Chaos, but the captain stops him saying, "You think your bullets can hurt him?" In reality, "Professor Chaos" is just a nine-year-old boy in a costume; the fact that people suddenly thought he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taken a level in badass</a> was meant to be a joke.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's become something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> that Bumblebee will always try to use his stingers (weapons that shoot beams of electricity) on Decepticons even though they never do <em>anything</em> (until he fought Swindle which was in the <em>24th</em> episode).
</li><li> There's also the time Sari tried to take on the Constructicons with a <em>hockey stick</em>.
</li><li> Averted in the Animated game for the DS. If you shoot an enemy with your stingers for a little while they eventually do die.
</li><li> In the third season premiere, it was revealed that the stingers have two settings, the higher one meant for combat bots which Bumblebee currently is not. Optimus gives Ratchet a little flak for changing the setting, but Ratchet simply snaps back that Optimus is hardly in a position to complain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">given the situation</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>: The humans repeatedly try to use conventional weapons (bullets) against the Decepticons, to no avail. The shots just bounce right off, every time.
<ul><li> In the two-part season 2 episode "The Key To Vector Sigma", the Centurion Droids are completely unfazed by any attacks at all. The Decepticons keep shooting at them despite the blasts having no effect whatsoever. Megatron eventually manages to gain control of them using the Key, and the Autobots manage to trick them into diving off a high cliff after some reanimated zombie-bot corpses, but since they are programmed to guard Vector Sigma it's probable that it would take extraordinary means to destroy them.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Barring a lucky shot, massive animals such as rhinos, grizzlies, or walruses can easily soak up bullets from small-caliber weapons without stopping. Large crocodilians, which have bony armor plates under their skin, can be virtually unkillable with light ammunition; during WWII, Japanese infantry who'd retreated into the Pacific islands' marshes could be heard throughout the night, screaming and firing in vain at bellowing crocodiles. A small few made it back to dry land, for once content to surrender.
</li><li> Pretty much all modern armoured vehicles are at the very least immune to attack from small arms. A few lighter vehicles are even capable of resisting mines and anti-tank rockets, though anything that isn't a tank is going to be taken apart by high velocity armour-piercing ammunition. In the case of main battle tanks, they're practically invulnerable to any anti-tank weapon that isn't current generation. The famed RPG-7 tends to have about the same effect on modern tanks as a pigeon, as proven in one case where a British Challenger 2 MBT took around <em>seventy rockets</em> and still managed to keep going. American M1 Abrams MBTs have been able to take multiple hits from their own gun in a number of friendly fire cases and are so difficult to destroy by their crews that it will often require the insides to be stuffed full of C4 to blow them apart. At least once, a crew had to abandon their tank and their fellow soldiers attempted to destroy it to prevent it from falling into enemy hands - an effort that proved to be entirely unsuccessful. Eventually, they gave up and the tank was later towed back to base to be restored to working condition.
<ul><li> The common version seen in video games that seems suicidally useless actually does have a true purpose in reality. Shooting a tank with machine gun fire has the advantage of forcing the crew to button up and seal themselves up inside the tank which severely limits their situational awareness and forces them to look through small periscopes, thus making them more vulnerable to things such as anti-tank mines or soldiers sneaking up to plant charges on the tank's vulnerable treads or engine rear armor. This is less limiting with modern tanks due to their more sophisticated thermal sights and cameras. Before tanks had laser sights, machine gun fire was also used to "Zero in" the main cannon, as both were often mounted in the same Mantlet and were both aimed at once.
</li><li> Modern vehicles have relatively few vulnerable points thanks to the time and money spent in development by comparison, but pretty much every tank in history has been vulnerable to track or external optics damage that can render them immobile or blind with far less effort than it takes to actually pierce their armor. An RPG-7 is unlikely to penetrate a modern tank, but it can detrack one more often than not.
</li><li> Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">famous</a> A-10 Warthog's 30mm Avenger cannon is of only limited use against modern tanks. It was of limited use against the modern tanks when it was brand new in the 1970s as well, although there were plenty of older tanks still in service at the time that it was more than adequate against. Which is why the A-10 was also designed and upgraded over time to carry various specialized anti-tank missiles and guided bombs. As alluded to above, however, the many <em>many</em> things on the battlefield which <em>aren't</em> tanks are still very vulnerable to the 30mm gun.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of modern armor, there's also body armor too — <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXMjh_XbkiI">there's this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showing a soldier in Iraq who gets sniped centre of mass, only to get up again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow">Cue freaked-out insurgents.</a>
<ul><li> Cool story, but this trope is decidedly <em>not</em> in effect with modern body armor. Such armor is rated to take a certain kind of fire from a certain distance for a certain number of hits; it is still being damaged and will break with more or concentrated fire. Nor is the man wearing the armor at all invincible; the armor will have gaps where a bullet can enter. Even Type IV Armor (the highest level of protection) leaves certain important areas exposed, like the eyes, extremities, the face, and so on. Additionally, its defense against armor-piercing rifles depends on it having ceramic plate inserts, and these are worn in front of the chest and back. Had the soldier been hit in his side by an AK-47, it would likely penetrate. See <a class="urllink" href="http://www.qmuniforms.com/paraclete-alpha-1-tactical-vest-complete-set-with-axiiia-ballistics?PMSRCE=QMPLA&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwgZrJBRDS38GH1Kv_vGYSJAD8j4DfUxQU4qe7KkC54BpwBX4uMJ-r55t1Q5wQ8aCGU54JohoCupDw_wcB#.WSdNqGjyvIU">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for an example of modern type IV armor, and you will see it definitely doesn't make you invulnerable.
</li></ul></li><li> Selecting the type and level of penetration a bullet can achieve is extremely important depending on the type of target. The lightest bullets tend to only be effective for target practice or extremely close range. Some of the most tragic police shootouts (for example, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout">North Hollywood shootout<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of 1997) have occurred because law enforcement had underpowered weapons against criminals with body armor.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22ivk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note22ivk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22ivk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The body armor is bullet <em>resistant</em>, not bullet <em>proof</em>, and there is always places where an unlucky shot from even the cheapest, crappiest gun can break through, and even with armor the impact of the bullet is still felt and it can break bones and damage organs, in addition to knocking the victim down.</span> Before the North Hollywood shootout, there was the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FBI_Miami_shootout">Miami shootout of 1986,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where the two criminals didn't have body armour but still survived multiple gunshot wounds long enough to kill two FBI agents and injure five more before they finally died.
</li><li> Standard operating procedure in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> when faced with an ironclad was to either gather many, many other ships to shoot it with, or get another ironclad and settle down into an hours-long duel. Thick armor of the time was effectively impenetrable, but the wood that supported it (usually oak) could only withstand so many blows before it broke. The classic example is the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Tennessee_%281863%29">CSS Tennessee,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which, after having her exposed steering chains shot away, was surrounded by the Union fleet and pounded on until the supports for her 6" thick iron armor started to break, forcing surrender.
