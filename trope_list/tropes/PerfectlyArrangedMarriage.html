They'll rip their clothes, gnash their teeth and swear to... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss">was that them necking in the atrium?</a>
</p><p>Despite their initial opposition, the couple who have been betrothed discover they not only like each other, but <em>love</em> each other, and make it perfectly clear that even if they weren't in an arranged marriage they'd still choose to marry or at least start dating. Drama being what it is, you can expect their earlier attempts to undo the arranged marriage will mature and succeed, and their parents set them up with a new fiancée or fiancé that they <em>do</em> hate. Expect one or the other to have to swallow their pride and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">come out and say</a> they do love the other.
</p><p>A variant is that both meet outside of the home environment (before or after the declaration) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonLoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPersonLoveTriangle">without immediately recognizing each other</a>. Maybe they ran away from home entirely, only to happily embrace "a fellow in misery" — and <em>later</em> commiserate about their bossy parents. Eventually, once they recognize one another, their shared common ground helps them fall in love.

One or more of the parents involved who knows both well enough has arranged the marriage since both are highly compatible and could naturally fall in love. In fact, this is the <em>purpose</em> of an 'arranged marriage' in the first place. It is akin to a matchmaking service, and the couple will generally have some sort of courtship before tying the knot, and it's very rare for someone to be forced to marry a person they despise. Even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> would want a decent relationship if for no other reason than to help in securing the knot.
</p><p>In other cultures, however, especially feudal societies, marriages would be struck between noble houses to secure alliances, build power, get closer to the throne, etc. In cases like this, the couple's individual romantic tastes are a very low priority, as they see the marriage as a duty to their families. But then it turns out they love each other after all.

It's not a violation of free will if both <em>want</em> to get married, after all.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>, 10-year-old Ciel has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">his cousin Elizabeth</a>. Interestingly enough, even from the beginning, there's no objections or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss">Slap-Slap-Kiss</a> from either side, and both of them take it as being natural and are rather fond of each other. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToyShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToyShip">they are only kids...</a>
<ul><li> It ought to be noted as well that three years later in the manga, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">all the awful things that happened to Ciel that left him orphaned, abused, atheist, and a little too grown-up for his age</a>, Ciel's love for Elizabeth is even stronger. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend">does her best to protect him</a>, now what she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taken a level in badass</a>.</span>

She, at least, is definitely in love with him (she comes right out and admits it at least once, although not to Yoh's face). Yoh's feelings, while a little more ambiguous, definitely include affection for Anna (albeit mixed in with a healthy dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">fear</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During the Osorezan Revoir Arc -where we see Anna and Yoh's first meeting- it's explicitly shown that it was <em>Yoh</em> who was the first to fall in love.</span> By the second half of the manga we see just how much Yoh cares for Anna; he puts her above everyone else he knows. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> For example, when the X-Laws tell him to quit the Shaman Fight in exchange for bringing Ren back to life, he starts off by thanking everyone else for helping him get that far, then apologises to Anna and Anna alone, even though there were others who would have been disappointed because one of his reasons to become Shaman King was a promise made to her.</span>
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em>, Shun Mitaka is introduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">Asuna Kujou</a> by way of an <em>omiai</em> arranged by his uncle. She is head over heels in love with him. He, on the other hand, objects strongly to the union at first, partially because he is in love with Kyouko, but also because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhydidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhydidItHaveToBeSnakes">her large number of dogs</a>, of which he is <em>deathly</em> afraid.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk">Basilisk</a></em>, Gennosuke Koga and Iga-no-Oboro's betrothal is arranged in order to put an end to the long-standing war between their respective families.

<ul><li> In a sort-of variation, it's mentioned in the manga that Gennosuke actually was <em>not</em> the first option for Oboro. Her grandmother Ogen had thought at first of engaging Oboro to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">her second-in-command</a>, Tenzen Yakushiji, but decided against it since she didn't fully trust him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Considering that Tenzen turned out to be a ninja version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> <em>and</em> the series' especially cruel and sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">she was right</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em> goes through the setup for this with Mashiro and Takumi - both escape from an arranged meeting that Mashiro's staff hopes will lead to better things and meet incognito in the poor side of town. Mashiro is definitely crushing big-time on Takumi by the end - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then he gives a scathing critique of her performance as queen, and his aides announce that the purpose of the visit was to announce the complete isolation of Takumi's kingdom.</span>
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne">The Vision of Escaflowne</a></em>, with Princess Millerna Sarah Aston and Prince Dryden Fassa. She and Dryden are a mild version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> as Millerna's put off by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Rich Idiot With No Day Job</a> facade and Dryden is a snarky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a>. (Not to mention Milly has a huge crush on Allen). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They grow fond of each other as the series advances, and then they get married - and then the trouble starts. And when it's all solved, Dryden calls off the engagement: he cares for Millerna and might be in love with her at that point, but he feels he still has to work hard to become truly worthy of marrying a girl like her.</span>
</li><li> Used in 70s shoujo manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaikarasanGaTooru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaikarasanGaTooru">Haikarasan Ga Tooru</a></em>, where the Hanamura and Ijyuin clans arrange a marriage between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">Benio Hanamura</a> and Shinobu Iijyuin before they were even born. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">Plucky Girl</a> Benio refuses the idea at first, but when she sees that Shinobu is a genuinely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> who <em>does</em> care for her, she starts falling for him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And <em>then</em>, they become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a>.

<ul><li> There's also a variant in this: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Benio and Shinobu's engagement was arranged as a sort-of compensation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">for a love match that couldn't be consummated</a>, between Benio's now-deceased grandfather and Shinobu's beloved grandmother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByGrandparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByGrandparents">who raised him instead of his parents</a>.

The cubs also bring up the point that, because they're best friends, it would be "too weird." However, neither makes much attempt to foil the marriage, as Simba goes into self-imposed exile for unrelated reasons long before it becomes an issue. When they meet again as adults, they follow the rest of the trope to the letter.

Later, while on his way to court another princess, he is attacked by Felicity's animal friends and she nurses him back to health. Why does he find himself thinking of Felicity constantly while courting the incredibly beautiful princess?

His first marriage is a politically important match to a princess of a rival house who, better still, has been raised to regard him as hellspawn. Kelson is incredibly nervous, but the girl is young and beautiful - and he is seventeen - so by the time the wedding day rolls around he's convinced he's falling in love and there are indications that the girl may be too. Unfortunately, Kelson is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowedAtTheWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowedAtTheWedding">widowed before the ceremony ends</a>. In the next book, he falls in love with a perfectly acceptable princess - who, due to convolutions of plot, is rendered politically impossible as his wife. It is she who arranges for Kelson to marry his final prospect, a cousin who is a really ideal match from the political point of view. At first Kelson, still desperately in love with the other lady, can hardly bear the thought of marrying elsewhere but as he gets to know Araxie better the marriage becomes less and less distasteful to him...

They aren't in love yet (something to do with him being in his thirties and her being only nine), but they are very close. Another example is Ludwig Guenther and Emilie.

To find out her groom-to-be is, by most accounts, the most eligible bachelor in Alethkar is not too shabby. Over the course of the book and the next one, they fall genuinely in love with one another, especially with Adolin's stability, earnestness, and kindness helping to anchor Shallan as she deals with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">Lightweaving powers</a> and their severe impact on her mental stability.

<ul><li> Certainly the <em>goal</em>, if not the reality, of a huge number of arranged marriages in the past. A marriage alliance will hardly pan out if the linchpin people don't like each other.
</li><li> Behold, <em>Los Reyes Católicos</em> (Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabel I of Castile—you know, the ones from 1492, Columbus sailing the ocean blue, turning on the Emir of Grenada because God told them to, those guys), first rulers of united Spain. Following their advisors (and, on Ferdinand's part, the recommendations of his father), they mutually arranged their marriage for purely political reasons—their marriage would unite the Castilian and Aragonese branches of the House of Trastámara and place all the Christian kingdoms of Iberia (save Portugal) under a single royal line. However, they were both young, reasonably attractive, and made a good team, and by all accounts, they got along tremendously. Additionally, at least four of their five children and their most famous grandchild all had marriages like this—with the twist that it never ended well:
<ul><li> The eldest, Isabel, was betrothed to Afonso, the heir to the Portuguese crown, through a treaty in 1480. When they met in 1490, they quickly fell in love and had a happy marriage. However, it was short, because Afonso died in mysterious circumstances (he fell from his horse even though he was an excellent rider, and his Castilian valet had disappeared without a trace) that benefitted Isabel's parents. Isabel became grief-stricken, and the only reason she did not enter a convent was that her parents never allowed her to. She would eventually marry Afonso's uncle, King Manuel I of Portugal, but she died giving birth to their child, Miguel (who in turn died less than a month short of his second birthday), to the deep sadness of her parents (and their political disappointment: they had hoped Miguel would unify the Iberian kingdoms). Isabel's younger sister, Maria, became Manuel's next wife; theirs was the only marriage involving the Catholic Monarchs' children that ended up as a boring late-medieval/early-modern royal marriage characterised by neither great love nor great tragedy.
</li><li> Their only son, Juan, was betrothed to Margaret of Austria as part of an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximillian I. The two of them fell in love quickly, and, apparently, spent a lot of time in bed together. However, an illness took him before their first anniversary.
</li><li> Juana, their third child and (after the business with Isabel and Juan) heiress to the unified kingdom, married Philip the Handsome, Duke of Burgundy, through the same alliance that married Juan and Margaret (Philip was Maximilian's only son and heir). The marriage turned out this way... too much. They literally fell in love at first sight,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1rrwy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1rrwy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1rrwy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hardly surprising, considering they were both teenagers, of similar temperaments, and, oh yeah, attractive — he wasn't called Philip the Handsome for nothing, and Juana was by all portraits and accounts a stunning pale redhead.</span> and they begged to have the marriage formalized the day they met so they could get it on right away. They had six children (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Emperor</a> Charles V, the ruler of the first "empire on which the Sun never sets"). Eventually, things happened, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Juana started to get jealous</a>—but she still loved Philip deeply. But then he died young, and her grief and her jealousy had some kind of wicked party in her head with a familial disposition towards insanity (in fact, it was something of a minor miracle that both of her parents were sound of mind, given that both were members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">ridiculously-inbred House of Trastamara</a>). Hence the epithet "the Mad" - her father Ferdinand had to become Regent of Castile upon his daughter's ascension instead of ruling jointly until she inherited Aragon upon his death. She also carried around Philip's dead body on her travels, another reason for her to be considered mad. And she had him buried so that she could see his tomb from her bedroom's window. Poor mad girl indeed. Phillip the Handsome's death would require a trope of its own.
</li><li> Perhaps Ferdinand and Isabella's most famous child was their fifth, Catalina—known to history as Catherine of Aragon. Betrothed to the English heir Arthur, Prince of Wales, she went ahead and married him; we'll never know how good that marriage could have been, as Arthur died shortly after the wedding. However, Arthur's younger brother, the new heir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry</a>, was a well-educated and boisterous-but-goodhearted young man, and Catherine apparently found him charming, at least in an amusing-boy way. The English court (after some hemming and hawing) thus decided it would be best if Henry married his brother's widow—even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">this required special dispensation from the Pope</a>. The marriage was <em>very</em> happy for the better part of its 24-year existence (although not happy enough to keep Henry from taking mistresses)—but of course, we all know how it ended...
</li><li> The aforementioned Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor—son of Juana the Mad and Philip the Handsome—initially selected Isabella of Portugal to be his wife for purely political reasons. When they met for the first time (to finalize the agreement), however, they fell intensely in love with each other almost at once. As a sign of how happy the marriage was, Charles remained faithful to Isabella for as long as she lived, and when she died he was so distraught that he retired to a monastery for two whole months of mourning. (He would later return to the monastery after too many years fighting the Wars of Religion in Central Europe led him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone">Abdicate the Throne</a> completely.)
</li></ul></li><li> As with all tropes associated with royalty, the monarchies of the various British kingdoms are rich in examples of this one:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EdwardTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EdwardTheFirst">Edward I</a> and his wife Eleanor of Castile<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2wfm7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2wfm7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2wfm7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Incidentaly, a paternal-line great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great aunt of the aforementioned Isabella of Castile</span> were famously devoted to each other, having married quite young at 15 and 12 respectively as part of an alliance between his father, Henry III of England, and her half-brother, Alfonso X of Castile. Despite having only met each other the day before the wedding, Edward and Eleanor became virtually inseparable over their 36 years of marriage, and Edward was never known to have taken any mistresses. Utterly distraught when Eleanor died in 1290, Edward accompanied his beloved wife's body back to London and ordered the construction of memorial crosses at every place where Eleanor's body rested for the night, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_cross">Eleanor crosses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, some of which still survive.
<ul><li> Edward was fortunate in having this with both his marriages, as he also had a very happy marriage with his second wife, Margaret of France. Despite a 40-year age gap (he was 60, she was 20), he and Margaret were said to have been extremely happy. She was kind and got along well with his children by his first wife. She was known for her unjealous nature, attending memorial services for Eleanor with him and even naming their own daughter Eleanor after her. When he died, after just 8 years of happy marriage and despite her only being 28, she never remarried, famously saying "When he died, all men died for me". She remained close to her stepchildren though, even attending the births of their children.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheSecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheSecond">Richard II</a> and his first wife Anne of Bohemia, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, married basically as the result of a papal schism (the Roman Pope, Urban VI, urged an alliance against Team Avignon), and while the marriage was very unpopular initially — Richard had to lend his new brother-in-law (Emperor-elect Wenceslaus IV) a substantial sum to pay for Anne's journey to England, while Wenceslaus couldn't afford to provide Anne with a dowry — it was a huge success at the personal level, and Richard and Anne soon proved to be inseparable; they didn't even really maintain separate households, as was usual with medieval monarchs. Richard was, unusually for a medieval English king, genuinely interested in his wife's culture and indulgent of her large retinue, and although they were unable to have children, Richard never held it against Anne (the traditional practice at the time was to blame infertility on the woman). When she died, possibly of plague, in 1394, Richard was utterly devastated; he assaulted the Earl of Arundel for being late to her funeral and asking to leave early<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3sk6a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3sk6a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3sk6a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Richard had some bad blood with Arundel, it must be said, and some of this involved Arundel having a history of disrespecting Anne</span>, and he later had the palace of Sheen, where she had died, torn down. It is likely that Richard's grief for Anne contributed to the general instability he experienced in the final years of his reign, leading to his deposition and murder.
</li><li> Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, parents of Henry VIII, also fell into this. Their marriage was arranged by their politically ambitious mothers, who were jointly eager to oust Richard III; Elizabeth's claim to the throne (being the eldest child of Edward IV) was a mite stronger than the young Tudor heir's (being a maternal-line great-grandson of a legitimised bastard grandson of Edward III), but Henry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">was a man</a> and the Tudors were better able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">raise an army</a> (through their Welsh connections). By uniting the claims, they both had a better chance of success. The couple accepted it without much complaint, and by the time they were a few years into the marriage, it was a genuine love match. It probably didn't hurt that Elizabeth was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman">World's Most Beautiful Woman</a> of the day, while Henry was shrewd and conniving but kind-hearted and pious; unlike their son, historians can find no indication that he ever took a mistress. Notably, when Elizabeth died, Henry was so devastated that no one except his own mother could get anywhere near him for weeks, and when he finally agreed to consider finding a new wife, his description of what he wanted was basically a carbon copy of Elizabeth. He ultimately did not remarry, and only outlived her by six years.
</li><li> The British monarchs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover">The House of Hanover</a> produced three of these.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4t2kq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4t2kq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4t2kq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> and Prince Albert don't count. Rather than being set up by their parents or governments, they married because, of Victoria's multiple eligible royal suitors, Albert was the one she fell in love with. Not quite the same.</span>
<ul><li> George II and his wife Caroline of Ansbach were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> and devoted to each other. George particularly relied on Caroline's advice in politics, as she was universally acknowledged as a much more shrewd player than her husband. They were happy even in spite of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">constant philandering</a>—she knew of and cleared all his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress">mistresses</a> ahead of time, vetting them for both personal flaws and potential political entanglements. He never remarried after her death: Caroline begged him <em>on her deathbed</em> to remarry when she was gone, but he was so certain no woman could replace her that he replied tearfully, "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench">Non, j'aurais des maîtresses!</a></em>" ("No, I shall have mistresses!").
</li><li> George II's grandson and successor George III, despite only meeting Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz on their wedding day, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to her. He and Charlotte were absolutely devoted to one another, and he (unlike his grandfather and father—and most of his sons) never took a mistress. Together they had fifteen children (eleven of whom lived past the age of 60).
</li><li> George III's third son William IV was originally reluctant to make a political marriage, choosing instead to live unmarried for twenty years with an unsuitable Irish actress (by whom he had 10 children). However, after that relationship ended, he married the German princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meningen as a political match—and a financial one (he had been deeply in debt before the marriage). The marriage got off to a rocky start: William famously treated the wedding ceremony as a joke, offending the pious Adelaide. However, with time, the marriage proved to be a happy one—William does not appear to have strayed much if at all, and he treated her as a confidante and advisor as well as a beloved wife (much as his great-grandfather George II had treated his great-grandmother Caroline). For her part, she was happy to treat her husband's illegitimate children almost as her own - especially the youngest ones, as neither of her two daughters with William survived infancy. She also shared her husband's great affection for his niece and heiress presumptive Victoria; Victoria's mother's incessant snubs to Adelaide were the trigger for William's famous announcement that his only mission in life was to live just long enough to allow Victoria to become Queen without a regency. (He did, to Victoria's eternal gratitude.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The marriage between <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_of_Hungary#Early_life_and_marriage">Princess Elizabeth of Hungary and Landgrave Ludwig IV of Thuringia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It certainly helped that she went to live with his family when they were both children and got to befriend each other first, thus making them also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">Victorious Childhood Friends</a>. Ludwig was a staunch supporter of Elizabeth's religious and charitable work, despite the disapproval of the rest of his family; after he died, she ran away from both her in-laws and her own family and preferred to become a nun rather than remarry. She was later named a saint.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Last">Llewelyn ap Gruffudd<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the last native Prince of Wales before it was conquered by the English, arranged a marriage for himself with Eleanor de Montfort, daughter of Simon de Montfort because the latter was helping him to defend his crown and position. It turned out to be a genuine love match, despite an age difference of more than 20 years; Llewelyn is almost singularly unique among the Welsh princes for never having been known to take a mistress, and when Eleanor went the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">Death by Childbirth</a> route bringing Princess Gwenllian into the world, Llewelyn lost it. He was persuaded by his greedy younger half-brother Dafydd to enter a dangerous campaign against the English, something he had been steadily resisting in Eleanor's lifetime, and died in the fight. (Dafydd, who then claimed his brother's throne for himself, is believed by many historians to have been instrumental in luring his brother into the trap which killed him. He was eventually captured and ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves">Rewarded as a Traitor Deserves</a> by becoming the first person in recorded history to be hung, drawn, and quartered.)
</li><li> The case of Sisi and Franz Josef spawned one of these - but <em>not</em> for Sisi and Franz Josef themselves. While they got along decently for royals, inasmuch as they didn't really fight, and Franz Josef didn't really take many mistresses (probably no more than two or three over the life of their marriage), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLove">Franz Josef was way more into Sisi than she was into him</a>; the free-spirited Sisi found the ultraconservative Franz Josef a little stiff and the ultraconservative Habsburg court rather stifling. Instead, it was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchess_Helene_in_Bavaria">Helene of Wittelsbach<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Sisi's "spurned" older sister, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with Prince Maximilian of Thurn and Taxis turned out to be very happy. Indeed, Nene was the <em>only</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> one among the <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts">unlucky-in-love</a> Wittesbach sisters until Maximilian died of kidney failure at the age of 36. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter">Nene never remarried, and turned to philanthropy and managing the family businesses to ease her loneliness.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PompeyTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PompeyTheGreat">Pompey the Great</a> married Julia, the daughter of his political ally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a>, in an effort to shore up their waning alliance. Despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">significant age difference between the two</a>, they were so caught up in each other that many of Pompey's colleagues found it indecent. It is worth noting that Pompey and Caesar's true antagonism to each other didn't arise until after Julia's death, an event that seems to have devastated both men.
</li><li> Vipsania Agrippina, the daughter of the famous military commander Agrippa, was betrothed to the future emperor Tiberius when she was less than a year old. Despite this extremely political start, once they actually got married, they fell in love and were very happy together. Unfortunately, it ended badly, as Tiberius was forced to divorce her for his stepsister Julia, while she was pregnant with their second child, no less <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5oc6r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5oc6r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5oc6r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Augustus could do that; the <em>paterfamilias</em> of a Roman family had absolute authority over his children even when they were adults, especially the female ones, and especially when he was also the emperor.</span>. When Tiberius saw Vipsania after the divorce, he actually burst into tears, which is a sign of how much he loved her because Roman men <em>did not</em> show emotion in public.
