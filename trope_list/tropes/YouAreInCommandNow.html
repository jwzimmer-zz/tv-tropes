In fiction, the situation is often adequately chaotic that the one that actually gives orders may find himself pressed into command and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leader">leadership</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is the premise of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>: Bright Noa, a mere officer trainee with no battle experience whatsoever, is forced to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Cool Starship</a> <em>White Base</em> when nearly all of his superior officers are killed in the first episode surprise attack by the Principality of Zeon, and the one survivor (the captain) succumbing to his wounds shortly afterward. By the time <em>White Base</em> finally makes it to a friendly base and there's a chance to replace Bright, he's demonstrated enough skill and ability to justify leaving him in charge despite his relative inexperience (though he is promoted to Lieutenant JG). This also nicely mirrors the protagonist Amuro Ray <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">Falling into the Cockpit</a> of the eponymous battle robot that he knew only the bare minimum about.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, the same thing happens to Lieutenant Murrue Ramius, who becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Archangel</a></em> after all higher-ranking officers are killed in a surprise attack. She offers command to Lieutenant Mu La Flaga, who has seniority (but identical rank) and greater experience, but he insists on deferring to her because he is the only available pilot other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">Kira</a>. Since the ship has two functional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">mecha</a> at the time, both Mu and Kira are needed in the cockpits, leaving Murrue the only choice.
</li><li> Murrue does this again in the sequel, offering command of the Archangel to Commander Waldfeld (who joined them towards the finale of SEED but commanded his own ship during that time) who both outranked her and had a good two or more years worth of combat experience than she did despite her service in the last war. Waldfeld rejects the offer for both the same reason as Mwu (he's only pilot other than Kira, and Cagalli, who as the leader of Orb shouldn't really be out fighting) and because he was a Commander of Zaft, their enemy from the last war, and therefore isn't as familiar with an Earth ship as an Earth Soldier would be. Of course it's worth noting at this point rank on Archangel is just a technicality as they are operating independently of any actual army anyway.
</li><li> A similar situation minus dead superior happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team</a></em> when in the middle of an urban skirmish, team leader Shiro Amada abruptly orders the team's <em>sensor technician</em> Eledore Massis to take command under the rationale that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Shiro can't see much through the limited field of view of his Gundam's cockpit display whereas the sonar microphone of Eledore's hovertruck is omnidirectional, thus Eledore can track and relay the enemy's position to the others much more effectively that Shiro can</a>, freeing Shiro up to fully concentrate on combat.

Seniority aside, Bromhead was deaf, which was the reason he was posted to Rorke's Drift, where no action was expected.

Ritter von Greim is an even better example however: he was also already a general, but when he makes it to the bunker he is put in command of the entire German air force (which is all but completely defunct by this point in time), and told that he has to rebuild it from the ground up. When Hitler starts claiming that he'll be able to give Greim a thousand jet aircraft on short notice, it's become obvious that reality and him don't see eye to eye anymore.

Deconstructed and subverted as well. The United Nations Navy is very strict about the chain of command and under what circumstances command can legally pass from one officer to next. Any violation of this is considered mutiny and punishable by death. Nicholas Seafort is the senior midshipman on a space ship that is sent on a multi-year voyage to visit a space colony in another star system. On the way there the Captain and senior lieutenants are killed in an accident and the surviving lieutenant takes command with Seafort having to take on the role of the XO. The new Captain dies a month later from an agressive cancer and Seafort is the senior line officer on board. The ship's doctor and chief engineer have higher ranks but are not line officers so they cannot take command unless Seafort resigns command. However, Seafort is a strict believer that oaths are sacred and his oath to the Navy means that he has to follow the regulations to the letter and there is no regulation that would allow him to resign the Captaincy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>, being an ex-navy officer, brought this up a number of times in his books.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> has two examples. First he gives a historical example: during the capture of the <em>Chesapeake</em> by the <em>Shannon</em>, a midshipman was technically in command when it surrendered, but got cashiered for desertion because he had gone below deck. Then he explains a possible case where a third lieutenant (cadet/ensign) could end up commanding a division, and notes that "you'd buy the farm" if it happened.
<ul><li> The actual historical situation was a bit more complicated, He wasn't actually cashiered for desertion; the charge was brought against him, but the evidence basically came down to the accused and another officer making contradictory claims, and both of them had a vested interest in <em>not</em> being found to be the person in command when the vessel was lost. The charge that stuck was something along the lines of "failure to properly encourage his men", which by the standards of the time basically meant that he didn't kill a few of them to convince the others to stop retreating so that he actually <em>could</em> get back above decks (and he was, eventually and posthumously, exonerated of even that).
</li></ul></li><li> Also, someone mentions an offstage example where a junior officer was in command of a brigade.
</li><li> He also wrote a book around this trope, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarmanJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarmanJones">Starman Jones</a>.</em> The eponymous character signs aboard the passenger liner <em>Asgard</em> as a steward (and has to forge papers to get that position). He gets a position as apprentice astrogator because of his ability and because the ship is badly short-handed in astrogation. At the end of the book he winds up as captain because the original captain, astrogator and assistant astrogator have all died and only an astrogator can hold command of a spaceship that is underway.
</li><li> In Heinlein's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IfThisGoesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IfThisGoesOn">If This Goes On</a></em>, John Lyle, a junior officer in the rebel forces attacking the Prophet's capital of New Jerusalem, is thrust into the position of commanding the whole force, when his commanding officer is wounded and his tank-analogue seems to be the only one in effective communication with all the others. Lyle isn't technically next in the chain of command (he's a staff officer/aide de camp for the commander, doubling up as tank commander). However, he doesn't trust the next in line to handle the situation (too cautious) so he continues to issue orders in the commander's name, even though the commander is out of contact. Once things reach a "safe" state, he tells the real next-in-line "you are in command now".
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a></em> the Everyman narrator, Mannie Davis, ends up in control of the Lunar Revolution's government <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and wins the Revolutionary War</span> when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">old catapult</a> is destroyed and communications between the Lunar government and his secret military base are cut off by Earth's bombing. This situation was anticipated, so Mannie was given appropriate orders and plans.
</li><li> A much less extreme version occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceCadet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceCadet">Space Cadet</a></em> where Cadet Jensen, the senior cadet, takes command of an expedition to an unexplored region of Venus to investigate a native uprising when the Lieutenant in charge is rendered comatose in an accident. Aside from Jensen and the Lieutenant, the expedition consists of two other cadets. However, they are there because no one else was in a position to respond so Jensen is acting well above his pay grade. The other two cadets (all three entered the training academy at the same time) accept this, probably because it's Jensen's home planet (the other two are both from Earth), so he has a better understanding of conditions and cultural factors.
</li></ul></li><li> The book <em>Spaceship Medic</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison">Harry Harrison</a> deals with this scenario. The eponymous medic ends up in charge after all the rest of the ship's officers are wiped out by a meteorite hitting the bridge (then has some adventures, saves the day, and goes back to being a doctor).
<ul><li> Though it's not easy for him because there's a general on board as a passenger who thinks he should be in charge, at one stage launching a mutiny.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">once a book</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em>: the flagship of a formation is destroyed, or battle damage kills the captain of a spaceship. Sometimes things work out fine; usually they don't. In each example, David Weber spends at least a paragraph explaining why it is that this person is now in command, instead of the higher ranking/more qualified personnel on the next ship over (or even in the next room). The results are not always pleasant, but the logic is always sound at the time.
<ul><li> He also uses this with the short story "Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington". The eponymous character gains command due to the battle, controls the situation, and emerges victorious. She is later given a promotion earlier than normal, but only to Ensign instead of several or more ranks.
</li><li> <em>The Short Victorious War</em> gives two examples.
<ul><li> A communications officer on the dreadnought HMS <em>Bellerophon</em> is taking the night watch because of his lack of seniority, essentially there to keep the Captain's chair warm and call him if there is an emergency. The dreadnought suddenly finds itself in an engagement with a group of Havenite battlecruisers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntSeeThatComing">much to the surprise of both sides</a>, and not having time to wait for the Captain, ends up winning the engagement through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">sheer disproportionate weight of firepower</a> by reading down a checklist.
</li><li> Most plot-relevant to the entire series is Honor's assumption of command at First Hancock in <em>The Short Victorious War</em> — already flag captain, she commands the task group when the admiral is incapacitated, despite <em>not</em> being the senior remaining officer<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lgrj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0lgrj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lgrj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The circumstances of Honor's assuming command are not entirely illegal, however — while she was not the senior remaining officer of the task force, the senior remaining officer was on another ship without access to the flag bridge's command datalinks, it would have required a nontrivial amount of time simply to brief him on the details of the current situation, and the task force was under fire and a command decision needed to be made <em>immediately</em>.</span>. She's vindicated (winning the personal approval of the Queen, no less), but the fallout from that one action sets the stage for the following novels <em>Field of Dishonor</em> and <em>Flag in Exile</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Not just in the Honorverse; examples abound in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a>'s other books.
<ul><li> In the stand-alone novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InFuryBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InFuryBorn">In Fury Born</a></em> the protagonist Alicia DeVries gets one of these when her unit is shattered during the Shallingsport operation. She begins as a sergeant first class, leading a <em>squad</em>, and less than ten minutes after the battle starts ends up in command of her entire <em>company</em>. Then again, her company in the same span of time goes from a full complement of 275 troops to 63 survivors (they drop into what was supposed to be a clear LZ, in what was supposed to have been a surprise raid... and land right on top of a dug-in enemy battalion with heavy weapons that knows they're coming, and has been waiting for them).

<ul><li> However, Reddy is not willing to let a "Snipe" command a ship, so he sends his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">XO</a> to take temporary command.

Colonel Kasteen was a company commander in a garrison regiment but was given command after every other senior officer was eaten by tyrannids. Major Broklaw, a soldier with far more combat experience, became her XO because she had three days seniority in grade on him, which was due to the fact that the senior officers in his crack planetary assault regiment <em>were not eaten as quickly</em>.

When most of the bridge crew is slain and the captain cut off from his usual empathic command of the ship, he asks for Valdemeer to take the helm. Valdemeer tries to fight back, but the ship is already near-destroyed, and he and the captain are killed without being able to inflict telling damage on their killers.

</li><li> <em>Necropolis</em>:
</li><li> Milo takes the initiative after a sergeant was killed. Gaunt wrestles with putting him in the position but decides that being the youngster trooper, it would be too much (Rawne considers this a mistake on his part).
</li><li> Later in the battle, Gaunt is temporarily "promoted" to be the supreme commander of all Imperial forces in Vervunhive, despite the fact that he's only a Colonel-Commissar. This is because the other ranking officers are either dead, disgraced, or members of a Tank regiment (and apparently an Infantry commander always takes precedence over a Tank officer). However, after the battle, he is restored to his regular rank, though he keeps the city's ceremonial power sword.

He goes from being the Third Sub-Tribune to the Tribune Logistica (Third assistant to the Quartermaster, about as low in the chain of command as an officer can get, a position he had never even earned, being appointed there for intelligence-gathering purposes), whose duties to that point consisted mostly of latrine-digging (As punishment from the Quartermaster for catching him at petty embezzling) to commander of a legion. He does far better than anyone else could ever have hoped to.
</li><li> In Dudley Pope's <em>Ramage</em>, at the very start of the book the main character finds out that every senior officer has been killed, making him the captain of a frigate. Which is badly damaged, sinking, and under attack by a superior enemy vessel.

Interesting because he got the promotion 100 years ago and, it was believed at the time, posthumously.

Due to a mid-voyage mutiny, a relationship with the new captain, some dramatically convenient casualties, and, to be fair, a whole lot of work on her part, she winds up in command. And then they have to send her away as soon as the XO is well enough to replace her, because while she's done a good job, there would be too much resentment from the ranks to keep her on.

Due to various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcons</a>, Pellaeon now <em>was</em> a full captain at Endor... it's just that his ship was commanded by an admiral, so he was still second in command until said admiral was killed.
<ul><li> It has been suggested that Pellaeon may not have been <em>the</em> most senior officer remaining after Endor, as Thrawn suggested to him that the Emperor had been using a mild version of the battle coordination Force technique perfected by Joruus C'baoth on his senior command officers to bolster their efficiency, and that when he died, the backlash robbed those commanders of their own independent ability and effectiveness. Pallaeon may not have been have been targeted by the Emperor's abilities, or have been less susceptible than most, so when he had the initiative to sound a retreat, the other remaining captains and officers lacked the willpower to analyze the situation for alternatives or do anything else but obey.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of the trilogy, when Thrawn dies, Pellaeon takes command of the fleet, and several books set later have him reporting to or working with various high-ranking Imperial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">villains of the book</a>; he always survives their inevitable deaths, and since he's actually very competent he becomes Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Hand of Thrawn</a></em> duology. That's somewhere between Thrawn's and Vader's level of authority. That's right, Pellaeon becomes the most powerful man in the Empire, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">what's left of it</a>, by being unspectacularly good at his job and surviving <em>everyone</em> who outranked him.

Commander at the time) on board the Stargazer. Captain Daithan Ruhalter and First Officer Stephen Leach are killed and critically injured, respectively, suddenly forcing Picard into the position of temporary CO. He doesn't exactly have an easy time of it, but since future canon has him as the Captain of the Stargazer, he eventually gets a two-grade jump to Captain.
<ul><li> Subsequent novels reveal that not everybody was happy about the promotion. Specifically, Admiral Arlen McAteer has his own vision of Starfleet, and it doesn't include young upstart captains like Picard. While McAteer can't demote Picard himself, as Picard reports to Admiral Mehdi, he can set tasks for him that would reveal Picard's incompetence or lack of experience, forcing Mehdi to reverse his decision. This is ironic, considering the books go into great detail to show McAteer himself as overly-ambitious, seeing nothing wrong with ambition himself (to the point of disliking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">Shakespeare</a> for his criticism of it).

Later, the fleet is ambushed by several Slan ships, and one of the Slan beams destroys the CIC and kills the admiral. <em>America's</em> Captain Grey attempts to continue the mission but comes into conflict with the captain of the Pan-European battleship from whence the slain admiral transferred, whose intention is to return to Sol for new orders.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em>, when Chloe Williams, one of the founders and the CEO of the International Commodity Co-op that acts as an underground market for Christians during the Tribulation, is caught by the Global Community and executed for crimes against the state, Lionel Whalum takes over her job as its new CEO, keeping the business active until the Glorious Appearing.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloEvolutions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloEvolutions">Halo: Evolutions</a></em> story <em>The Impossible Life and Possible Death of Preston J. Cole</em>, this is how the future Admiral obtained his first command. He was a Second Lieutenant of his ship that found itself and two others caught in an Insurrectionist trap that destroyed one ship and crippled the others, killing or incapacitating the rest of the bridge crew in the process. Unable to raise the other damaged ship, Cole promoted himself to acting leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">and sent a distress signal to the enemy, while ordering the crew to prepare a missile to fire directly into the enemy's docking bay</a>. He himself notes in the ship's log as he takes command that any repercussions that come with this breach of military protocol will fall squarely on him alone as a result (luckily for him, the military brass decided to simply do nothing considering the gambit worked and stopped the enemy).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeepSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeepSecret">Deep Secret</a></em>, the Koryfonic Emperor, and almost all of his high-ranking staff, are assassinated. Dakros, a mid-ranking military official, winds up in charge of the entire empire, at least until he can find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince">Hidden Backup Prince</a> and hand things over. One of his associates suggests it might be simpler to give up the search and crown himself Emperor, which Dakros vehemently refuses, partly out of loyalty to the throne and partly because the late Emperor left the empire in a mess that no sensible person would <em>want</em> to be responsible for.

Sheridan is the XO on the ship until he notices that his captain has been crushed by a piece of bulkhead. He takes command and manages to destroy the Minbari flagship by luring it into a minefield. Despite not being a full captain at the time, everyone always refers to him being a captain at the time because of this trope. Even Delenn states that only one human captain has ever survived a battle with the Minbari fleet, referring to him. Earthforce appears to follow the naval tradition that the commander of a ship is <em>always</em> the Captain, regardless of actual grade.
</li><li> In one two-parter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyMiller">Barney Miller</a></em>, Barney is suspended for trying to negotiate with tenants of a condemned hotel rather than using force to remove them.

"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh my God.</a>" (Nick's tenure as acting-captain was limited to calling it a day immediately after his elevation and wearing a suit jacket to work—the department sent an interim officer the next day.)

<ul><li> Bill Adama, old warhorse ship's captain about to be put out to pasture, finds himself in command of the entire Colonial military, what's left of it. All sorts of people who previously filled fairly minor roles are suddenly thrust into positions of great authority... in many cases, they're doing the same jobs they did before, but those jobs are now of critical importance because there's nobody else doing them. For that matter, the eponymous Battlestar is itself promoted from "antique vessel about to be mothballed" to "flagship of the Colonial battle fleet." (Also <em>only</em> ship of the Colonial battle fleet, but that's par for the course with this trope.)
</li><li> His son, Lee, is appointed CAG by Colonel Tigh as he is the highest ranking pilot on board, despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">background material</a> saying that Lee is a reservist.
</li><li> After the deaths of Admiral Cain and Colonel Fisk, there's no-one to take command of the battlestar <em>Pegasus</em>, so Admiral Adama appoints Barry Garner, an engineer, as its commanding officer. This doesn't work out very well, as Garner treats the crew more like parts of a machine than as human beings and jumps straight into a Cylon trap.
</li><li> This again happens when Garner leaves the CIC during an intense battle to fix the FTL drives, telling Lee that "you have the conn". Lee gets promoted to full commander at the end of the episode.
</li><li> In the finale, Lt. Hoshi is later promoted to Admiral in the wake of a mutiny led by the man who otherwise would have got the job had he not snapped, and everyone else that would have stood between him and the position had also been killed off by that point. Not a bad finish for the guy who entered the series as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">guy standing in the corner looking utterly mortified</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">Admiral Cain</a> orders an attack on <em>Galactica</em>.
<ul><li> Hoshi is only really in command of the civilian ships and whatever military units are left when the Galactica goes off on its final mission. There are still plenty of more senior officers but they are all going on the mission. His new rank will not become effective until they are all killed (very likely at that point). At this point the military rank structure is shot anyway and being competent and loyal gets you the job.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in "Blood on the Scales". Gaeta and Zarek launch a mutiny and attempt to oust Adama from command. Roslin manages to escape <em>Galactica</em>, and Adama is brought back to the CIC. After Gaeta orders him to tell Roslin to stand down, still addressing him as "Admiral," Adama scoffs at this and rips off his insignia, tossing them to Gaeta. "You're the Admiral now. So you call up Roslin. Make her laugh."

As Zoey tells Simon in a deleted scene, by the end of it he had the command worthy of a general. When one of his men says they need an officer's authorization to get air support, he tears a patch off a dead lieutenant and hands it to the trooper, congratulating him on his promotion.
</li><li> Basically the entire plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Near the end of Season 1, King Robert dies. The boy he believed to be his son, Joffrey, takes the throne. However, on the (correct) belief that Joffrey is not actually Robert's son, Robert's younger brothers Stannis and Renly both proclaim themselves King.
</li><li> Ned Stark, Lord of Winterfell, leaves Winterfell to take up the post of Hand of the King, elevating his eldest son Robb to Acting Lord of Winterfell. With the death of his father, he becomes Lord of Winterfell and, not long after, the King in the North. Later, Robb leaves Winterfell too, to go south for war and his younger brother Bran becomes Acting Lord. Winterfell is then invaded by Theon Greyjoy, who declares himself to be Lord. With Theon's capture and Robb's death at the hand of the traitorous Lord Bolton, legally Bran should be the Lord of Winterfell, though he is unaware of this, and the world believes that he is dead and that his sister Sansa is Lady of Winterfell.
</li><li> King Joffrey names his grandfather Tywin Lannister as Hand of the King. However, Tywin isn't actually present as he's fighting a war, and his eldest son Jaime is held captive by their enemies, so Tywin appoints his younger son Tyrion as Acting Hand.
</li><li> When the King is away from the throne, the Hand exercises all the King's powers, to the extent of sitting on the Iron Throne.
</li><li> Jon Snow takes command of the defense of Castle Black when everyone else is incapacitated or cowering. After he retakes Winterfell, the contrite lords of the North anoint him King In The North.
</li><li> At the end of Season 5, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tyrion is given governance of the city of Mereen, while Dany is missing and Jorah and Daario look for her, with Varys and Grey Worm at his side</span>.
</li><li> In season 6, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after hanging the people who killed him, the resurrected Jon Snow hands off command to Dolorous Edd and resigns from the organisation. This is unprecedented, but so is members coming back from the dead; Jon swore an oath to serve until his death, and he has very definitely died.</span>
</li><li> Daenerys leaves Daario Naharis and the Second Sons in command of the newly renamed Bay of Dragons (formerly Slaver's Bay) to oversee Meereen, Yunkai, and Astapor's transition into democratic city states.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens to Bullock twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham">Gotham</a></em>, the first time when Captain Barnes is knifed out of action protecting Gordon from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a resurrected Theo Galavan</span> near the end of Season 2 and the latter when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Barnes is permanently incapacitated due to being infected by the virus in Alice Tetch's blood</span> approximately one third of the way through Season 3.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> telefilm, Lieutenant Eccleston is mortally wounded and passes on command of the captured French frigate <em>Papillon</em> to Midshipman Hornblower. Although he's junior to Simpson, Horatio had just accused Simpson of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">Unfriendly Fire</a>, so it was a reasonable call (especially since Eccleston knew Simpson from their previous ship). Simpson's tantrum convinces the petty officers and sailors to follow Horatio's orders instead, and he leads their prize to a heroic action against some corvettes that have ambushed their home ship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>:
<ul><li> At various points throughout the show Harm, Mac and Singer gets the chance to be Acting JAG for short whiles. Sturgis takes over as Acting JAG for an extended period of time between Admiral Chegwidden's retirement and General Cresswell's appointment.
</li><li> In "Guilt", Mac, as the senior officer present, has to lead the evacuation of the U.S. Consulate in East Timor after an explosion caused by rioting locals (due to a Marine raping a local girl) kills the Marine detachment's CO and blinds the XO. Ironic, given that the skipper of the Amphibious Assault Carrier she was on temporary assignment to earlier in the episode remarked that:
<div class="indent"><strong>Skipper:</strong> I keep forgetting you're a non-combat officer. I guess the only land mines that you dodge are legal ones.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Hawkeye has to take command of the eponymous unit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> several times during his stay in Korea.

The only temporary commander of the 4077th that is tolerable is Major Winchester, and that's because he uses his times in command to loaf (and doesn't interfere with day-to-day operations).

This is true, as Rimmer and Lister were the only surviving crew members and Rimmer outranked Lister. Lister needed only to pass the chef's exam in order to assume command, but he couldn't manage that. However, as Lister and Cat are able to fly Starbug and Kryten was the most knowledgeable of the bunch, you have to wonder in what way Rimmer is really in charge from season 5 onwards.
</li><li> Played for laughs in an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> when Becky is allowed to babysit Darlene and DJ for the evening. Darlene says that if Becky has a heart attack, she's in charge. Then DJ says that if Darlene also has a heart attack, he's in charge.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dan:</strong> Right, DJ. If both your sisters are dead, you're in charge.

</li><li> A frequent occurrence in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> franchise.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Catspaw": A landing party that includes Scott and Sulu is taken prisoner. Kirk assigns himself and Spock to the rescue party, which <em>also</em> gets captured. This leaves Assistant Chief Engineer Lt. DeSalle, an obscure character that most viewers have never heard of, in command of the <em>Enterprise</em>. (DeSalle appeared in a grand total of 3 episodes.) Robert Bloch's original script had everyone senior to Uhura off the ship, and left her in command, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> wouldn't allow for a black woman being put in command of the <em>Enterprise</em>.
</li><li> "Amok Time": After blood-fever affected Spock apparently kills the captain, Dr. McCoy invokes this trope.
<div class="indent"><strong>McCoy:</strong> As strange as it may seem, Mister Spock, you're in command now. Any orders? <br/><strong>Spock:</strong> Yes. I'll follow you up in a few minutes.

<ul><li> "Disaster" puts Troi in command, as the most senior officer left on the bridge (despite the fact that she has no command training, which gets addressed in a later episode). This is one of the areas where Starfleet breaks from current-day practices. Troi would most likely have been a commissioned officer and would not have taken command. Ensign Ro would have, especially since she was a command division (line) officer.
</li><li> "Descent" leaves Dr. Crusher in command of a skeleton crew while everyone senior to her has off-ship duties. Unlike Troi, however, Crusher has taken and passed the Bridge Officers' Test, and actually enjoys command. (In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a>, she eventually gets her own command—the medical ship USS <em>Pasteur</em>.)
</li><li> "The Arsenal of Freedom" has Geordi in command, and puts him in conflict with the more senior Chief Engineer Logan. When Logan tries to pull rank, Geordi states that he is in command until he is relieved by either Captain Picard or Commander Riker. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as Geordi would be considered the Officer of the Deck as delegated by (and thus may only be relieved by) the captain or XO. Humorously, Picard refuses to accept command back until Geordi gets his ship back in one piece (he ordered a Saucer Separation to protect the civilians on board), so he gets to be captain a little longer until the saucer is retrieved.
</li><li> "Remember Me" has Dr. Crusher quickly ascend the ranks as everyone else on the ship ceases to have ever existed in the local universe.
</li><li> "The Best of Both Worlds" puts Riker in command when Picard is kidnapped and assimilated by the Borg. Troi even quotes this trope.
</li><li> "Tapestry" reveals that this is how Picard got his first command. He was serving as a bridge officer on the <em>Stargazer</em> when the captain was killed and the first officer was injured. Picard took command and salvaged the situation. In the aftermath, Starfleet Command was impressed enough with Picard's actions that they promoted him directly to captain and gave him command of <em>Stargazer</em>.
</li><li> "Gambit" shows first Riker taking command when Picard gets killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(kidnapped, actually)</span>, then Data becomes captain when Riker is taken. This leads to much drama when Data promotes Worf (who openly questions his command decisions) to first officer.

The EMH gets promoted to the status of <em>sentient being</em> as the result of this trope.
</li><li> "Displaced": The crew is abducted one by one, forcing everyone else to pick up the slack. Suddenly a <em>very</em> young ensign is Chief of Security. In a bit of gallows humor, Chakotay jokes, "Who said there was no room for advancement on this ship?"
</li><li> "Workforce": The Doctor commands <em>Voyager</em> all by himself when the crew has to evacuate. This is the point of upgrading him to the Emergency <em>Command</em> Hologram, temporarily replacing his medical database with a tactical one.

</li><li> "One": The Doctor and Seven of Nine are the only crew members not in stasis.

<ul><li> Mostly justified in that he tends to be the calmest person in any given situation and can quickly analyse a situation and come up with a plan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then subverted when he has to be <em>told</em> that a commander can't just give orders, and has to <em>inspire</em>, and the stoic, withdrawn Squall has a span of a couple of minutes to figure out how to <em>do</em> that.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a> IV</em>, Colonel Blair finds himself in this position aboard the <em>Intrepid</em> when Captain Eisen leaves for Earth to reveal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tolwyn</span>'s plan, even though he's Space Force and not Navy. Somewhat subverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">novelization</a>, in that he was assigned a Lieutenant from the Navy who was too junior to promote to Captain (rank, not position) to give the actual commands for carrying out Blair's orders. In the real world, aircraft carrier captains must themselves be part of the aviation community (i.e. have been a naval aviator themselves).
</li><li> Even in video games, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> ventures into this territory:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>
<ul><li> This is how the Starfleet player becomes captain of their own ship, starting off the game as an ensign. The ship in question is a small one with a crew of only 200, and it's specifically noted that the Borg who boarded it while the player was assisting another ship wiped out the officers first, leaving the player as the <em>only</em> surviving officer of that crew. (This is also noted as unusual behavior by the Borg and eventually explored later on in a high level mission.) Once the player reports in to Admiral Quinn to get his battlefield commission formalized, the Admiral outright admits that they've been reduced to this by how pressed Starfleet is to deal with their various border conflicts.
</li><li> The revised Starfleet tutorial now has the player as the designated first officer of a training crew fresh out of the Academy - the captain was the only officer of any real rank on the whole ship. Cue a disastrous encounter with some Klingons which results in the captain getting captured and killed, and everyone on board looking to you for direction. As with the original opening Starfleet mission, the player then reports in and is formally given command because Starfleet is in desperate need of even moderately effective command staff - ships are a lot easier to make than capable officers, and Starfleet is facing problems from all sides.
</li><li> An interesting variation with the Klingon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>. When you first choose him/her, he/she's second officer to Captain Jurlek. However, when you discover Jurlek's treachery concerning a Federation prisoner and alert his first officer, Doran, she ends up getting slain before she could perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a>, which advances you to first officer. Only a few minutes pass between Jurlek calling you the new first officer and you performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a> on his cowardly hide.
</li><li> The Romulan Republic's Admiral Kererek mentions that the Romulan Star Empire made him an admiral after the Hobus supernova to fill vacancies left by the destruction of Romulus. Before that he was a desk jockey working in logistics and ship deployment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">(which admittedly is a pretty good background for a high-ranking flag officer to have)</a>. He joined up with the Republic way later.
</li></ul></li><li> This is mentioned twice in the backstories for the teachers in <em>Star Trek: Klingon Academy</em>. One of them was due to a vacancy that the man created himself via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a>. The other was briefly Captain of his ship on the grounds that he was the seniormost officer on the bridge when the original Captain died, and then surprised the first officer (who was busy elsewhere when the Captain died) by turning command over to him at the battle's end instead of attempting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a>.
</li><li> Happens also with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekBridgeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekBridgeCommander">Star Trek: Bridge Commander</a></em>, though the situation seems a bit silly if you think about it. Your character has been a commander for only 3 months when the Captain is killed by a supernova. Starfleet sees fit to advance you to rank of captain, give you your own first officer, and loan you Captain Picard for advice for a few missions. A possible justification for this is only implied and not outright said: Starfleet is sorely undermanned in the area of the galaxy where the game takes place. To wit: you only see about a dozen other starfleet ships, but fight hundreds of Cardassian ships.
<ul><li> A few missions later, your entire crew is transferred to a <em>Sovereign</em>-class ship (i.e. the same class as the <em>Enterprise</em>-E). Apparently, your accomplishments are enough to command a flagship-level ship.

Of course, since the other Blades agents mostly do their own things and any orders from Cyrodiil to the contrary are liable to come with an actual superior, Caius basically tells you to ignore the big picture and just keep doing what you're already doing.

Losses incurred in the attack and Admiral Anderson remaining behind on Earth to command <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> also left Admiral Steven Hackett the highest-ranking Alliance Navy officer left alive and free.

Though once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Udina is killed</span>, humanity's political structure is virtually rendered non-existent, making him essentially the leader of the entire human race.
</li><li> General Adrien Victus inherited the rulership of the Turian Hierarchy after Primarch Fedorian's escape shuttle was shot down by the Reapers and most of the other senior officers were killed in battle. Garrus points at that he's an unexpected choice because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick">Military Maverick</a> ways made him highly unpopular with the commanders, but that his high rank despite that is a testament to his competence.

He/she isn't even second-in-line for the position of human Pathfinder (Cora is) and hasn't had Pathfinder training. However, Alec's decision to pass the title onto his son/daughter is done for plot related reasons that become apparent much later. (Namely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the Ryder twins are symbiotically tied to the <em>highly illegal</em> (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI">benevolent</a>) AI that Alec Ryder coded up for the Andromeda mission</span>.

To say that Tann is ill-suited for the position is...a fairly serious understatement. The amount of characters who actually <em>like</em> Tann can be counted on one hand, although, following Ryder's successes as Pathfinder, Tann does become more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">reasonable</a> over the course of the game.
</li><li> Kandros was a bodyguard for a prospecting team captured by the kett. After leading their escape efforts, he returned to the Nexus and found "all the Nexus personnel looking at him like he was in charge". He officially became leader of the Nexus Militia and took on many of the responsibilities of the Director of Security (a position abandoned by Sloan Kelly after the uprising).

</li><li> In the pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse2002">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2002)</a></em>, the last order the Elders give to Captain Randor is that he will lead Eternia in their place as its king.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestVersusTheCyberInsects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestVersusTheCyberInsects">Jonny Quest vs. the Cyber Insects</a></em>, each time Dr. Zin kills one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix">numbered</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, he promotes the one whose number is next, for example when he kills 425 he promotes 426. He even emphasizes "<em>You</em> are in charge now, [minion number]!" every time.
</li><li> A minor variant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>. The season four premiere has the Royal Guards tell Twilight that she's in-charge due to being the only available princess (Celestia and Luna are missing, and Cadence is occupied with ruling the further along the north Crystal Empire, leaving her unavailable in short order). This is a minor example due to her leaving immediately after giving only an order or two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines">Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines</a></em>:
<ul><li> Muttley becomes the leader of the Vulture Squadron in the episode "Sky-Hi I.Q." following the results of an aptitude test. Subverted at the end when the efficiency expert who conducted the tests got Muttley's test mixed up with Dick Dastardly's.

When Optimus and Ratchet have to investigate something, he leaves Arcee in charge. When Arcee and Bumblebee go on patrol, she leaves Bulkhead in charge. When Bulkhead needs to rescue Agent Fowler, he leaves Jack in charge. When Jack realizes Miko followed Bulkhead, he tries to leave Raf in charge, only for Raf to point out that he's the last one left.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers">Band of Brothers</a></em> (Reference: book by Stephen Ambrose and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers">mini-series</a>):
<ul><li> When the Battle of the Bulge begins all the higher ranking officers of the division are absent. When one of the officers starts complaining about this, the ever-competent Major Winters quietly tells him to concentrate on organizing his men and finding ammunition and winter clothing for them, instead of wasting time waiting for superiors who might never turn up.
</li><li> Dick Winters does this several times throughout the war. He drops into Normandy as a 1st lieutenant in command of a platoon, but ends up commanding the company because his CO is MIA (turns out, the CO never even set foot in Normandy — his plane blew up on the way). Later, when Major Horton is killed during Market Garden, he becomes battalion XO.
</li><li> Some time after he becomes Battalion XO and while he's still a captain, Winters acts as 2nd Battalion CO while Strayer (the actual CO) performs the duty of an absent Regimental Officer. This results in Winters having to contend with going up against the 1st and 3rd battalion COs, who are both lieutenant colonels, when it comes to acquiring resources for both the missions to which his battalion gets assigned as well as provisions for his men.
</li><li> Notably, with few exceptions, Easy Company had little problem with sudden loss of leadership: if someone of high rank was injured or otherwise unable to continue fighting, the company would quickly adjust for the loss and continue the mission. The one time leadership became a problem (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Lt. Dike froze with indecision during the attack on Foy</span>), Winters turned to Lieutenant Speirs, told him the trope and sent him out to lead Easy Company, who followed him with no problems.
</li></ul></li><li> At Pearl Harbor:
<ul><li> The USS <em>Aylwin</em> (DD-355) had four officers on board when the first Japanese aircraft appeared, all ensigns. Ensign Stanley B. Caplan, the senior one, had been at sea for only eight months and was in command of it for thirty-six hours (ironically enough, as he was obeying orders from the destroyer squadron commander to put out to sea, several men onboard saw their senior officers on a motor launch, but they could not stop to take them onboard until after the attack was over).
</li><li> The same thing happened to USS <em>Blue</em> (DD-387); again only 4 ensigns were on board (must have been the standard officer duty section) and they got underway and operated for 30 hours with an ensign in command, attacking two submarines and shooting down 5 Japanese airplanes.
</li><li> The USS <em>Nevada</em> (BB-36) spent most of the attack under the command of Lieutenant Commander Francis J. Thomas, who not only coordinated the defense of the battleship, but also got her underway and attempted a dash for the open sea. When it became apparent that <em>Nevada</em> would sink before she could clear the channel, he ordered her run aground to avoid blocking the entrance to the harbor. At the same time, Ensign J.K. Taussig assumed command of the ship's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">Anti-Air</a> batteries when the communications lines between them and the ship's command center were damaged. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">continued to coordinate the air defense</a> of <em>Nevada</em> even after losing a leg in an explosion, until being evacuated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">Navy Corpsmen</a> that had been called for by his gun crews.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, American soldiers who escaped capture took command of local guerrilla groups and promoted themselves to the rank appropriate for the size of their band. For the most part, the US military honored these self-made ranks after the war.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>: The Ten Thousand: in 401 BC a force of Greek mercenaries is hired by Cyrus the Younger to supplement his Persian troops to fight against his brother Artaxerxes II for the throne of the Persian empire. They meet at the battle of Cunaxa. While the Greek force suffers no significant casualties during the battle, their employer, Cyrus, is killed during the battle. They are then left stranded in the middle of the Persian empire. They are asked by the Persians to lay down their weapons but they refuse. The leaders of the Greeks are invited to a feast to negotiate a solution but are instead executed. The Greeks elect new leaders, among them Xenophon, who chronicled their fighting retreat through Persia, which lasted around 2 years.
</li><li> In the Soviet Red Army, especially during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, this happened frequently. Interestingly, their system was set up so an officer usually had to serve a given number of years in a rank before being promoted to the next one and they saw no particular reason to change the rule even if the officer in question was, through attrition, leading a much larger unit than he'd started with. If the officer was competent he was allowed to retain command and sometimes even promoted to a higher one while retaining the rank, thus leading to captains leading companies reporting to a lieutenant who led the battalion, while the regiment might be commanded by a captain who had several majors as his subordinates.
</li><li> On the first day of the ANZAC invasion at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">Gallipoli, Turkey</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">lack of planning</a> meant a lot of the soldiers just lost track of their commanding officers, if they were "lucky" enough to even get to the beaches, so this trope happened all over the place, for the unprepared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia">Australian</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand">New Zealand</a> soldiers. <br/><br/>Peter Lalor, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder">Australian</a> soldier is said to have seen that there were no officers for his battalion, the 12th, gave the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">rousing order of "Come on, </a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence">the 12th"</a> and charged at the Baby 700 Hill. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">He died</a>.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> and the War of 1812, the British wore, like everyone else, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a>, especially their officers (even though the Americans were no different in this regard). The Americans, used to hunting, could aim (both with their own hunting rifles, and well-packed muskets), and would choose the most visible targets. As a consequence, after the Battle of Bunker Hill and the Battle of New Orleans, certain British regiments were under the command of the senior <em>private</em>. (This is a an exaggeration, while a disproportionately large number of officers where lost, no regiments lost their entire complement of officers. After Bunker Hill, the closest is a Battalion being commanded by a Captain, normally a company commander. After New Orleans, Several Companies where temporarily commanded by Sergeants, due to the loss of both the Captain and all Lieutenants. Sill a valid example of this Trope, however)
</li><li> Between World War I and II, the German Reichswehr was severely limited by the peace treaty in the number of soldiers it could recruit. To make up for this, every soldier was trained in the job of his commanding officer, specifically so that the Reichswehr could invoke this trope to increase their number as soon as the treaty would no longer apply.
</li><li> There are numerous recorded instances from World War II in the Pacific of a ship being hit on the bridge and the senior surviving bridge officer assuming command. This often happened even when they were not the senior surviving officer aboard the ship, because those officers not on the bridge but more senior might be needed at their normal posts to keep the ship moving and floating. Perhaps the most extreme example was that a warrant officer (not even an ensign) effectively commanded the Japanese heavy cruiser <em>Mogami</em> for a couple of hours during the Battle of Surigao Strait because the surviving more senior officers were all directing damage-control or keeping the badly mangled engines running.
</li><li> The rank of Lieutenant implies this possibility: From French, the title translates as "Placeholder", a lower ranking officer who would take the place of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> should he be absent or incapacitated, hence the word often being used in the titles for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a> positions in various organizations (Lieutenant Commander, Lieutenant Colonel, Lieutenant General, Lieutenant Governor, etc.)
