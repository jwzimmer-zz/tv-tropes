</p><p>Congratulations. You've just met the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing — the polar opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold">Hidden Heart of Gold</a>.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a> is a favorite tactic of this sort of antagonist, and if they are genuinely evil, expect them to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>. Can also possibly overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>, or more especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a>.
</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that this trope isn't exclusive to female characters. The title is a play on "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWolfInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWolfInSheepsClothing">A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</a>," and can apply to any gender. All it requires is a person appears to be nice but is actually cruel and/or manipulative.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In romance plots, the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing is usually trying to date, dating, or about to marry another character, and is hiding their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask">true colors</a>. Occasionally, the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing genuinely <em>was</em> a nice person... but suffered sudden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests">remove their status as a love interest</a> for another character. In any case, expect them to make an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession">Engineered Public Confession</a> in one form or another.
</p><p>In some cases, however, a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing can be sympathetic. Many lighter cases involve a scenario in which a fairly flawed yet well-intentioned character makes themselves out to be more benevolent than they really are (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">especially if they have a high opinion of themselves</a>). More often than not, this charade falls apart and their true persona blasts out, usually in an extreme manner that makes them look even worse than they usually are. In some cases, a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing can lean more towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> if they aren't too busy hiding their unpleasant qualities with an over-enacted facade, instead of showing their genuine (and usually resented) redeeming aspects. Maybe someone will seem like this, then you realize they are just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch">Lovable Alpha Bitch</a> or a type B <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a>.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublemakingNewPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublemakingNewPet">Troublemaking New Pet</a> is a related trope where someone takes in a new pet, only to learn that the pet is a huge troublemaker or outright evil and gets rid of it afterward once discovered.

In a picture of an old deployment, Takaoka is standing behind four muscular young shirtless men in camo pants, ruffling the hair of one and his other arm slung over another's shoulder, a wide grin on his face and embarrassed, sheepish smiles on the faces of the cadets. The next picture shows Takaoka hugging the same two men to his chest with the same wide grin and the four cadets facing away from the camera...showing off the bloody scars all over their backs and their wrists bound behind them. And looking closely, you can see blood on Takaoka's knuckles as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">Wears the mask of a jolly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad">Team Dad</a> while being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> who truthfully only cares about himself.

<ul><li> Sugou Nobuyuki, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> of the Fairy Dance arc; Asuna's father Shouzou viewed him as a friendly, bright prodigy, to the extent that he set up an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> between him and Asuna and intended for him to inherit his company, RECT Inc. In reality, Sugou is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> towards Asuna who not only trapped 300 SAO survivors, including Asuna herself, in ALO in order to conduct inhumane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> experiments on them, but also planned to brainwash and rape Asuna and take control of the company. After Kirito defeats him, the sheep's clothing is flung off, and Sugou is arrested and incarcerated.
</li><li> Kyouji Shinkawa seems quite friendly and supportive of Shino and attempts to be there for her while she's trying to get over her past. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then he reveals his motives to her, and attempts to rape her, along with trying to kill her almost entirely out of the blue after seeing how she seems to be more interested in Kirito than him. Not only that, but it turns out he was in on the Death Gun plot.</span> This is potentially foreshadowed earlier in the arc. When Shino first starts to become more assertive in the real world thanks to Kirito's influence, he starts acting slightly creepy. Most people would be happy that their best friend is becoming more capable and seemingly better able to take care of themselves. Kyouji instead wraps her into a hug and begs her to stop being assertive and angry and go back to her normal calm self so that he can protect her.

To the school, she's the most exalted student; to those unfortunate enough to travel with her, she is a miser who uses her friends as tools and makes the guy who loves her do stupid and humiliating things while she ignores his pleas and thinks of riches.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> One episode during the Johto saga had a Teddiursa who used its cuteness to steal and fool people. When it ran into Ash's group, it stole their food and framed Ash's Chikorita and Totodile for what it did, and Misty was easily tricked. However, they eventually find out the truth, and when its cute charade fails to work on them again, it quickly drops the "sheep's clothing" part and just keeps on eating the food that it stole from the gang in defiance.
</li><li> An earlier episode, "The School of Hard Knocks," had Giselle, a student at Pokémon Tech who bullied the younger students under the guise of tutoring, who effortlessly beat Misty in a Pokémon fight and dismissed Ash's statement that trainers have to be friends with their Pokémon, even mocking Ash's Pikachu. Ash, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">puts her in her place</a> by beating her with said Pikachu.

When Shoya Ishida points out her role in the bullying, Miki cries saying all she wants is people to get along. Years later shes no better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">refusing to accept that she hurt Shoko as well and fosters all the blame to Shoya</a>, at one point her sweet facade drops completely when Tomohiro Nagatsuka tries to calm her by touching her arm she snaps at him calling him a disgusting blob.

Worse still is at the theme park when Ueno acts all nice and apologetic around Shoko whom she cruelly bullied, but as soon Ueno is alone with poor Shoko she makes it clear how much she still despises her, for splitting up her old friendship group and for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">taking Shoya away from her</a>.

But it's almost entirely an act to snare the main lead, who has made no secret that that's the kind of girl he likes. When there are no boys around, Doe-Doe is a ruthless gangster-type who bullies the other girls so they won't move in on her territory. What makes her a touch more sympathetic is that she is stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a> competition with the title character, rendering all her efforts fruitless from the start.

While her husband was having an affair, she was having one of her own with Yura's neighbor, Shinsuke (who Yura had a crush on). She and her husband were only together for the sake of their careers and their images, they didn't love each other. The two of them even agreed on a rule with each other that they would stay married as long as they hide their own adulterous affairs. After she decided to divorce Takayuki, however, it is shown that she has no intentions of taking care of Yura, and only cares about improving her image in the eyes of the public who had originally thought she was the "ideal mother".

So when the Count seduces her and innocently introduces her to toxicology and gives her a deadly ring which releases poison, Heloïse becomes murderous and tries to poison Valentine and her husband, as well as inadvertently almost poisoning Albert and one of the servants of the Villefort household.

To the students, however, she is the "wicked witch of expel", who noticeably has as much bitchiness as she does makeup on her face, and who expels students for even the slightest twitch and has taken delight in starting dates with men just to tug at their heartstrings and then shatter them to pieces. Yami Yugi reveals her true nature, but how he does so varies between the manga and the anime.

This is after he kicked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX">Professor Xavier</a> out of his own home because he kept secrets from Cyclops. To be absolutely fair to Scott, he really thinks all of this is necessary to ensure the survival of mutantkind after the various disasters of the past few years — and he might be right. Still, at one point, Wolverine, X-Force's field leader, reminds Cyclops that his hands are just as dirty as any member of X-Force's since Cyclops organized X-Force in the first place and gave them their orders. <br/><br/>Keep in mind, for most of his decades-long existence, Cyclops has always been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> and a straitlaced example of a boy scout and a Cape, essentially the mutant version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>.

This is to the extent that the Scoobies and the Potentials get fed up with her bossiness, as well as having doubts over both her leadership skills and methods, and finally decide that Faith would be a better leader and kick her out.

But when they meet him, Wade reveals to be a complete jerk who is rude to everyone and calls them all "Hobknockers" (We never find out what that means. All we know is that it's gross.

She's freed as it turns out that the killer was her therapist, who'd fallen in love with her and committed this murder to get her out. They're at a cabin together...at which point, she stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew. As he lies dying, he sees her wicked smile and realizes she was guilty all along and used him to kill an innocent woman just to get out of jail.

That being said, there are times that Hera actually got things right; why don't you ask Medea on how it turns out for Jason betraying her marriage?

Unlike the other targets, who are openly hostile to the Phantom Thieves right off the bat since they trust their influence to protect them, Madarame at least pretends to be nice and personable on the outside. He has several "logical" excuses prepared to cover his tracks if exposed, and it's only when the Thieves keep pressing the issue and forcing their way past his facade that he finally drops it. This is part of why Yusuke has such a hard time understanding the truth and why he takes it so badly once Madarame's crimes are exposed.

The former is actually a power-hungry, backstabbing schemer who killed one of the heroes and is currently manipulating King Marcus into marrying her in order to subtly take over the Remonian throne, and the latter is one of the four dreaded archdemons in disguise whose goal is to keep other races divided so that she can take over the world with her demon horde.

Stewie proceeds to kill him, chop him into little pieces, and toss the body in the garbage.
</li><li> Bonnie counts here as well. In "Go Stewie Go" she admitted to Lois that she cheated on Joe before, and encouraged her to do so as well instead of talking to Peter about how him calling Lois old was hurting her feelings. She attempted to cheat on Joe again in "Foreign Affairs", but was stopped by Lois bringing Joe there to stop her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">Then she acts like such a betrayed victim when, after acting cold and indifferent to Joe, he cheats on her.</a> And in "And I'm Joyce Kinney" when Joyce Kinney reveals in her news broadcast that Lois had done a porno, Bonnie immediately runs over to the Griffin house to point at Lois and call her a slut.

Apparently, she also torments <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">Buford</a>, but the audience has never seen her do it.
</li></ul><ul><li> Angelica Pickles in earlier episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>, while seemingly polite and sweet to adults, is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> who constantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">abuses her baby cousin</a> and his friends.

</li><li> First time you see her, Josephine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> looks more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a>; it's when her smile wears off that you realize why she's so good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">at her job.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Reverend Lovejoy's daughter Jessica. Everyone <em>believes</em> that she's a sweet, innocent minister's daughter, but (much to Bart's dismay) she's actually a manipulative little bitch. At the end of the episode her father is revealed to be well aware of her hellish behaviour, but overlooks it (to the extent of covering his ears and singing hymns at the loudest pitch possible) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">and tries to pass the blame onto Bart instead</a>. Given the addition of the Lovejoys' very fickle and conditional devotion to the Bible and society, the Reverend and his gossipy wife may also count as this trope.
</li><li> At her worst, Lisa Simpson can become one of these. She plays the humanitarian a lot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">but she also defines herself by a need to be better than everybody else</a>. Several times, when a character shows up and is able to do something better than Lisa can, she sets out to publicly humiliate them. This is lampshaded in the episode "Dial N for Nerder" when she and Bart think that they accidentally killed Martin. Bart feels guilty and wants to tell the truth and accept the consequences, but Lisa bullies him into keeping quiet to avoid her going to jail. At the end of the episode, Lisa says that there is a dark twisted person under her self-proclaimed innocent appearance.

</li><li> Butters' grandma has been revealed to be one as well, bullying her poor grandson when no one is looking. Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist">there is no foster care</a> in South Park.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, Navy is this in the episode Room for Ruby, pretending at first to want to join the Crystal Gems, and then ultimately ditching them once they let her see her old ship. When Steven asks why she didn't just steal the ship in the first place, she tells him she wanted to <em>see the look on their faces</em> when she got the ship back and delights in the fact that she tricked them, all with the same soft voice she always uses.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>:
<ul><li> From the first-gen cast, Courtney. At her introduction, she seemed civil and polite. However, as the series progressed, she reveals herself to be almost as much of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchAlert">Heather</a>. Courtney's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitionFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitionFreak">overly competitive</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">bossy personality</a> has alienated virtually everyone she meets.
</li><li> <em>World Tour</em>'s newcomer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Alejandro presents himself as a suave, charismatic, and gentlemanly casanova who makes the ladies swoon with both his looks and his charms. However, he soon reveals to the audience that he is in fact a cruel, selfish, and heartless bastard who sees the women he charms as puppets for him to exploit remorselessly - something pretty much all the contestants only find out once they've been eliminated by him.
</li><li> From the third-gen cast, Scarlett. At first glance, she appears to be an awkward and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">rather shy</a> genius. However, she quickly allies herself with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">wannabe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">supervillain</a> Max, and her seemingly nonthreatening facade hides her true murderous and psychotic personality.
</li></ul></li><li> The Ice Dancers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace">Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</a></em>. They act like Canada's sweethearts with smiles plastered on their faces, but they have a more sinister side underneath, especially the violently ill-tempered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitionFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitionFreak">Josee</a>. Jacques, on the other hand, seems to be more "Sheep" than "Bitch" at times, but the series does remind the viewers why they get along at all. Ennui calls Josee out on this in "Down and Outback" when she pretends to act friendly in an attempt to borrow his makeup.
<div class="indent"><strong>Josee:</strong> <em>(to Ennui)</em> Oh! Hey there... buddy. Do you mind if I borrow some of your makeup? <em>(smiles and laughs nervously)</em> <br/><strong>Ennui:</strong> Don't pretend to be friendly. It's gross.

When he next appears during the Battle Nexus arc, he acts friendly to the Turtles and claims to be regretful of his actions toward them, but it's soon made clear he hasn't changed one bit; he's conspiring to murder his own father to steal his War Staff and goes so far as to shoot Leo with a poison dart out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty">pettiness and spite</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>: Dr. Jonas Venture. When the show started, he was just shown as a God-like super-scientist and globetrotting adventurer who was just plain better than his son and heir, Rusty. But as the show went on, it was revealed that he was an extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who went back and forth between neglecting his son and putting him in situations of traumatizingly-high levels of danger. Further, the reason Rusty is such a failure who can't live up to his dad is because of his horrible upbringing which has left him a mental wreck.
</li><li> Qilby from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>. He's practically unrecognizable the moment he ditches the Sheep's Clothing.
</li><li> Darcy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> does this in one episode. After seemingly saving Riven's life, she deliberately acts sweet and cutesy (she even says "My name's Darcy" while giving a big cutesy smile that makes her two psychopathic sisters disgusted). Next episode, she's back to being a seductive and evil bitch who attempts to commit homicide against her rival for Riven (which shows how spiteful she is, given that she didn't even like Riven, and yet still wants to murder Musa just for liking him. Jesus).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pietro is introduced as one. At first, he pretends to be nothing more than a Rival and even helps Evan in luring a trap against whoever's ripping him off. Then he reveals, in an awesome manner, that <em>he</em> is the one who's been messing with him, and leaves him framed for vandalism and theft.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">Kitty</a> accuses Lance of this at the beginning of season 3.

<ul><li> Dona Isabella Verdugo appears to be quite a noblewoman, and behaves that way in public...but, in reality, she's a manipulative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialClimber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialClimber">Social Climber</a> who's determined to make her husband the <em>alcalde</em> (municipal magistrate) of Los Angeles and is willing to do <em>anything</em> to get it done. Only Don Malapensa and Zorro know her true nature — the former because he's being blackmailed to do her dirty work, the latter because he accidentally stumbles across the truth behind one of her schemes.
</li><li> Rosa, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">Identical Stranger</a> Dona Verdugo hires to impersonate Ines in "The Impostor," is this as well. At first, she appears to be a genuinely sweet girl who only participates in the plot because she's been told it's a harmless prank. Then she figures out it's not harmless at all...and she's more than willing to go along with it, so long as she's well paid.
