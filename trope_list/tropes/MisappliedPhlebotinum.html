<ul><li> The technology that allows your crew to travel from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Cool Starship</a> to the planet and back without using a shuttle is the same technology that can park a live warhead in the enemy captain's lap without using a missile. It also makes a nifty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay">Disintegrator Ray</a> if you skip the "rematerialization" end of the process or, if it doesn't work by dematerializing, send the receiving end into the sun. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut">only teleporting part of the target</a>. And unless it's ludicrously expensive/has major side-effects, it can be used to greatly reduce shipping costs and delays, and could remove the need for any other planet-based vehicle (if it's cheap and practical enough, you wouldn't even need to walk). This could also be used to dispose of hazardous waste, removing the need for massive landfills or toxic waste dumps. If it converts matter into energy, and you have a way of storing that energy, you could use it as an alternative source of power: converting otherwise useless garbage into a viable power source for other things. This would change the face of society.

</li><li> Note that it takes a really strong and accurately-placed gravity field to significantly change the trajectory of a laser beam or anything else moving at relativistic speeds  a field which, apart from theoretically consuming an extremely large amount of energy to maintain (depending on your flavour of Phlebotinum), might have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BlackHoles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BlackHoles">unintended consequences</a>.

<ul><li> In several seasons, the digital world from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> was created from computer programming and could subvert any laws of reality. In particular, humans who go there do not have to eat, breathe, excrete waste, or age if they don't want to. Said programmers primarily use their digi-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> abilities to... create inter-world portals and mess around with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Mons</a>.
</li><li> The way Miaka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em> used up her three wishes. Seriously, for how long the series went on, you would think the writer could have thought of better requests...
</li><li> Played straight then averted with the kagebunshin (shadow clones) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. Perfect duplicates of the jutsu's user whose memories are re-integrated back into the user when the clone is dispelled/destroyed. Up until Kakashi pointed out that they could be used for espionage and training, Naruto only used them to attack opponents mundanely. Fortunately, he now has used them to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">accomplish the world's fastest creation and mastering of a brand-new technique, the Rasen shuriken, which is also the first ever technique to combine perfected shape manipulation with nature manipulation.</span> Funnily enough, fanfiction has been taking advantage of the huge potential for years before that showed up, although the approach is frequently avoided for the reason that intelligent application of it can derail most of the challenges Naruto faces in the early part of the series.
</li><li> Acknowledged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories">The Five Star Stories</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> are shown to be quite impractical and temperamental, and its recognized that the whiz-bang technology that goes into creating them could be put to better use. What stops them is a combination of aristocratic tradition and the fact that if that technology were used for more efficient weapons it could result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">the destruction of entire planets</a>. Not a wise thing to do, considering there are only five or six habitable planets in their known universe.
</li><li> Somewhat averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion">Cannon God Exaxxion</a></em>. They go into a considerable amount of detail about all the interesting things you can do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity">Artificial Gravity</a> tech and how it dramatically changes the face of modern industry and combat. The limited way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NanoMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NanoMachines">Nano Machines</a> are used in the series smacks of this trope, but they at least bother to handwave it by citing the technology's astronomical cost.
</li><li> Averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em>.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> with Sakuradite, a naturally-occurring substance that is an exceptionally good conductor. It's used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> <strong>and</strong> consumer electronics, and is the reason the why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">Magnetic Weapons</a> have completely replaced gunpowder, even when it comes to personal firearms, and it's implied that the world runs on clean energy because of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jusenkyō — cursed springs that, when submerged inside them or splashed with water from them, give you the shape of whatever drowned there first until you turn yourself back with hot water (and then turn again with cold). Any living thing can be transformed into a multitude of other things: men, women, children, a huge variety of animals, twins, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerLottery">godlike lightning- and fire-spewing entities</a>. Yet no-one in the series ever thinks of [ab]using it to, for example, dump a handful of ants in the Spring of Drowned Ox and feed impoverished villages with the resulting hundreds of oxen. Worse, there's even <em>powdered</em> packets of "instant," single-use springs, but they're even more obscure than the springs themselves. About the only people who profit from the springs are the Musk Dynasty (who, in antiquity, would dump strong animals into the Spring of Drowned Girl in order to procure wives to yield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics">stronger children</a>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">the people of Mt.

</li><li> Seemingly played straight, but averted at the last second with in the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Yamasenken and Umisenken</a>. These are exceptionally devastating martial arts schools which emphasize, respectively, outwards force and absolute stealth. Warrior-minded fighters will seek them out to add to their repertoire... but in their creator's words, they're actually meant for <em>burglary</em> and <em>thievery</em>.
</li><li> Gosunkugi gets ten paper dolls which let him give people commands that they must obey. He suffers from a pretty severe lack of imagination. He tries to command Ranma to argue with Akane — he didn't succeed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">but nobody would have noticed anyway</a>. The other nine are similarly squandered.
</li><li> The cursed springs were actually exploited exactly twice: second by Rakkyōsai, who jumped into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">Spring of Drowned Child</a>. He did so for infiltration, but will presumably realize at some point that getting his youth back is a pretty sweet deal (there are faint hints that, powerful as Happōsai and Cologne are, their old age does inconvenience them). And the number one goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingFirstName">Pantyhose Taro</a>, who fell into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">Spring of Drowned Yeti holding an Eel and Crane while riding an Ox</a> and is the only one in the series actually LIKE his transformation.

Presumably because he was already a mashup.

There's no limit to people willing to pay him astronomical amounts of money for eternal youth (and assuming he needs to use the power continuously, they'd have to keep paying him). He uses it to weaken his targets before murdering them. However, he <em>is</em> a psychopathic axe killer, so fame and fortune might not actually rate higher than a satisfying murder.
</li><li> A plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters">Gundam Build Fighters</a></em>. Plavsky Particles are harmless radiation that can cause specific types of plastic to move around as though they were motorized vehicles and create energy beams, shields, and all sorts of other neat stuff. They're also cheap enough that buying a small particle-emitting table for one's household, while a bit of a luxury item, isn't out of the price range of a middle-class family. This technology is used <strong>exclusively</strong> for simulating Gundam battles with model kits. Nils Nielson's entire motivation is that he has asked the question "Wait, what? Can't this tech do a hell of a lot more?" and is trying to find ways of expanding the uses for the technology.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MegaManMegamix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MegaManMegamix">Mega Man Megamix</a></em>. The 5th generation Wilybots end up getting a job at an amusement park and most of their powers make them perfectly suited to the job (Wave Man uses his waterguns to help clean, Stone Man's strength helps repair rides, etc.). However Napalm Man, as his name suggests, was built as a specialist in weapons and is built like a walking tank, something completely useless to an amusement park. So what job is he given? Working the cash register and taking tickets. Note that Napalm Man has missile launchers in place of hands, making him doing a task that requires such dexterity not only impractical but actively dangerous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em> famously averted this in regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mecha">Mecha</a>. While you do see some mechs built for military purposes like most anime depicts, the majority of them are used for more practical, menial purposes. They're common sights at any workplace that requires heavy lifting and transport, police often use them in operations and have departments trained in their use, and security firms and crime families pay top dollar to have mechs for use as enforcers.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>. The revolutionary "Seed" program developed by Akihiko Kayaba is initially used just for entertainment purposes in the form of VRMMO games. But as time goes on, VR technology starts spreading to other purposes. The first major breakthrough comes in the form of the Medicuboid, a specialized VR interface meant for medical research and to help terminally ill patients. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnlineAlternativeGunGaleOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnlineAlternativeGunGaleOnline">Sword Art Online: Alternative Gun Gale Online</a></em> shows that several countries' armed forces are testing VR environments for use in combat training, while school sports teams also use VR for practice sessions building team cohesion. The biggest application comes in the <em>Alicization</em> story arc, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a next-generation, hyper-realistic VR world <em>completely indistinguishable from reality</em> is being secretly used by the Japanese Self-Defense Force to construct fully sentient artificial intelligences to pilot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">autonomous combat vessels.</a></span>

Once when asked to make a simple bubble he said that it was the "other guy" who did mundane things like that. On the other hand, until the 1970s the rings were really able to do <em>anything</em>, including wiping minds, acting on time-delayed and pre-programmed commands, transmuting matter, and mutating living beings at will. Really, neither Kyle nor Hal Jordan ever really noticed all the implications of the rings.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> has (had?) the Kapitalist Kouriers, a set of Russian super-speedsters who indeed used their powers for a courier business. All over the world. However: characters who do that instead of beating up on The Bad Guy of the Week don't get played in RPGs and don't get their own comic titles. So it's sorta self-defeating.
</li><li> An issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesForHire">Heroes for Hire</a></em> (which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, so at least these guys are getting paid for their work) has one of the "heroes" in a government warehouse where various captured supervillain equipment is stored. Upon seeing one piece of equipment, he notes the idiocy of inventing a gun that turns stuff into gold, then using it to rob banks. It takes him very little time to realize that he ought to steal the gun himself and use it in more intelligent ways. Unfortunately, it's broken shortly afterward in a super-brawl. He presumably was unaware of the fact that any object transmuted by the alchemy gun turns into dust after exposure to heat or after a certain amount of time. (However, mining and construction companies would pay a fortune for a device that could easily reduce solid material into dust regardless of what it became in the interim!)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em> :
<ul><li> Chunk, a supporting character of <em>The Flash</em>, was a "human singularity" who had the ability to transport anything to an alternate dimension contained within his body. He starts out as a supervillain, but Flash advises him that he could make a fortune by going straight. Now he is very well paid to make nuclear waste disappear, and drain the water from flooded cities.
</li><li> One issue had him do just this. He was hired by an antique film and memorabilia collector. He hired the Flash to watch all of his movies and examine all of his antiques and catalog them. Obviously made for the plot, but ingenious nonetheless.
</li><li> Another issue of Flash has Mirror Master being introspective about how he and many of his fellow villains are perceived as examples of this trope. He is perfectly aware of the fact that he and most of his compatriots could make more money selling their various technology (Freeze Rays, Teleportation, Weather Control, etc.) legitimately than they could ever hope to make robbing banks even if there were no super heroes. He does the supervillainy instead because he's an immensely disturbed individual, but is aware of the fact.
</li><li> Flash also agreed to transport a heart across the country for transplant. He was able to get the doctors to provide him with health insurance in return for this service. Of course as a hero he would be perfectly willing to do it for free to save a life, but as he pointed out, everyone else involved in the transplant would be well paid so why should he be expected to help for free?

John Byrne's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a> Luthor is rich, but he only sporadically does scientific jobs himself, preferring to supervise or steal the work of specialists; while he has a superior intellect and his empire is based on earlier inventions, he is mostly rich by being a mundane ruthless SOB.

Over a series of panels of Dr. Alchemy using his powers to perform a robbery, Manhunter points out that he could probably make more money a dozen different ways using a stone that would allow him to transform an object into something else, even if it was temporary.
</li><li> <em>Almost</em> subverted in DC's critically-acclaimed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starman">Starman</a></em> comic of the mid-to-late-1990s. Our Hero, Jack Knight, agrees to take on his father's mantle as Starman, <em>if</em> his father will in turn take the amazing Cosmic Rod technology that he's used for self-indulgent heroics for half a century, and adapt it to civilian use: clean power, antigravity, force fields, and more. In the final issue, Ted makes good on the promise, and hands Jack a thick sheaf of documents detailing exactly that. It's <em>almost</em> subverted because, years after the end of the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">no trace of the "spin-off" technology has been seen</a>.
</li><li> Seriously averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>. Dr. Manhattan's unique physiology and abilities are used to derive a massive amount of technologies, including electric cars. Ozymandias is running a mega-conglomerate, selling, among many other items, perfume and action figures based on himself and his colleagues. The original Silk Spectre also made a living as a model. She went on to marry her agent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> (at various times, Cable and the Six Pack also qualify) use their abilities for mercenary work, drawing a paycheck for using their powers and skills to hurt and kill people. It may not be particularly nice money, but hey, it's a living.
</li><li> The Hobgoblin invoked this when he discovered the Green Goblin's lair, reasoning that Gobby would have made far more money selling his equipment than he ever would have done through crime.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen">Ultimate X-Men</a> mentioned the theory that Charles Xavier used his telepathy to make money in stocks. He never actually confirmed this, but he didn't specifically deny it so much as pull a "I won't validate that with an answer."
</li><li> Lampshaded when Spiderman confronted the villain Sauron, who can rewrite DNA and used his power to make people into dinosaurs. Spiderman points out that with his power, he could do amazing things like cure cancer, to which Sauron retorts that he doesn't <em>want</em> to cure cancer. He just wants to turn people into dinosaurs.

Solar) from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValiantComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValiantComics">Valiant Comics</a> universe has the power to manipulate matter and energy any way he wants. Most of the time, he uses them to stop criminals that, even if powerful, were much weaker than him. Justified because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">first time he tried to use his powers to the fullest, the entire universe collapsed into a black hole, forcing him to re-create it as the Valiant Universe (a combination of the real world and stories from his favorite comic books)</span>.
</li><li> Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> in that it's implied that most of the big brains (Reed Richards, Hank Pym, Tony Stark) do make money patenting and licensing their creations. (It's canon that most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>'s funding comes from Reed's various patents, most notably unstable molecules.) A large chunk of their income actually comes from several companies that pay Reed NOT to release certain of his inventions, which might drive them out of business or make their entire industry obsolete.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>: Not entirely averted, as people like the Trapster and Spider-Man demonstrate.

One continuity had Peter try to patent the formula, and get rejected on the grounds that it wasn't permanent. Never mind that even an impermanent adhesive like that would have countless uses. If not <em>especially</em> an impermanent adhesive like that— take the formulation on Post-It notes, which has made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventyZillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventyZillion">Eleventy Zillion</a> dollars for 3M.

They would invent really big and scary weapons and tech, only to either misuse them or be so focused on the concept that they didn't make sure it would actually work in practice. Take the Phase Sixers; incredibly powerful and expensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers">Super Soldiers</a> capable of fighting whole battalions and fleets by themselves.

The fact that it robs people of their free will probably prevents it from ever being used legally or ethically, rape is no where near as much as could be done with it.

From that day on, Twilight has been defined more than anything else by her fear of her own power and potential.

And consider that his "food creation machine" converts ordinary H2O into complex organic food molecules (which means it could convert them into darn near any other material, organic or inorganic) — and apparently runs off the residual energy left over from the process.

This is somewhat justified by the fact that the main character is too crazy and vengeance-focused to use it for anything but his convoluted magic trick plot. Tesla, the inventor, could have used it to solve his funding problems and his feud with Edison.

However, he keeps running into problems whenever he tries to do it, for example animals end up dead, wristwatches end up going in reverse. Eventually when he tries it on himself, he ends up horribly burned, and with manic electricity powers. Everyone in the movie acts like a device that can convert matter into energy wouldn't still be a tremendous breakthrough by itself, even if it didn't have the capacity to reform it. Even he couldn't use it as a transporter, the ability to convert useless matter into stored energy would be a solid alternative power source. Even if the process took more energy to produce than it made, you could still use it to get rid of hazardous waste, making toxic waste dumps a thing of the past.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>: The battle droids' artificial intelligence. We've been trying for decades to create artificial intelligence so that robots can adapt quickly to changing situations. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, artificial intelligence is used to give robots human-like reaction times and indecisiveness, turning a killer robot army into comic relief.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Rifftrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Rifftrax">Rifftrax</a> notes this, marveling at the droids' "artificial lack of intelligence."
</li><li> Later, more advanced models are actually worse for this. In Episode One they had verbal orders and could be confused, by Three they had little chats while they worked.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in the novelization: A clone trooper, pretending to be dead for the benefit of a few battle droids, is able to communicate with his squad and recieve orders, since his helmet is designed to work on voice commands and chin switches, so it can be used even when immobilized. He muses that while clones are becoming more like droids, droids are being made more human (such as being required to speak <em>aloud</em> when using their communicators).
</li><li> The droids' lack of intelligence <em>may</em> be explained by the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executives</a>, especially the Neimodians, being extremely paranoid cowards that only used droid armies in the first place because they wanted soldiers that were one hundred percent loyal, constantly concerned about their subordinates turning on them, so could have intentionally had them programmed to be less than optimal. Also, it is well established that without constant memory wipes droids develop individual personalities, so this could have happened as well, though far less probable considering the aforementioned paranoia.
</li><li> The "FTL as a weapon" idea is averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> — if a hyperdrive approaches a gravity well, it automatically shuts down and reverts the starship to realspace. Or, failing that, melts. Which pulls the starship back into realspace. The time someone gets stranded in hyperspace, we find out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">why there are so many safeguards</a>. Also, if a ship hits a gravity well while in hyperspace, it's rather strongly implied that it will somehow be annihilated, killing all on board. The source of the gravity well in realspace would also be unharmed, because it's the "mass shadows" projected into hyperspace that cause this damage rather than a direct collision with realspace object.
<ul><li> Also, it's shown that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a> in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe are probably just strong enough to completely negate "FTL as a weapon" as long as you have a large enough power plant. At one point in an older <em>Star Wars</em> comic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">The Rebels</a> set up the Executor, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileLongShip">nineteen-kilometer supership</a>, on a collision course with three smaller-but-still-huge Star Destroyers exiting hyperspace, which promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">ram into the Executor at near light speed</a>. The fully-shielded Executor <em>shrugs off</em> the attack and casually proceeds with its original mission.
</li><li> The problem of gravity wells are actually used by the Empire with their <em>Interdictor</em>-class Star Destroyer in several <em>Legends</em> novels. The whole point of them is to pull Rebel, pirate, smuggler, and other criminals out of hyperspace and directly into an Imperial ambush. As such, they are largely used as a support role to police hyperspace lanes rather than directly combat opponents.
</li><li> The new canon reverses this completely. While the <em>Interdictor</em> vessels still work, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Resistance cruiser ramming them while accelerating to hyperspace cuts a ship bigger than the <em>Executor</em> in half, and completely destroys a dozen smaller Star Destroyers with the backwash.</span>

Now, if you can build a transporter that sends you across vast interstellar distances in an instant... <em>why do you need starships?</em> (Of course, the answer is — to prevent the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> franchise from turning into a funky version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a>...) Interestingly this was actually a concept early on in the pre-production development of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. People would just beam from planet to planet without bothering with warp drive and starships. Fortunately for the franchise this was considered a few steps too far.

He's assisted by a flying computer equipped with Artificial Intelligence, which would probably be worth millions, if not billions. Actually justified with the AI...he has NO idea how he did it. A plot point is actually him trying to get Flubber to market. The AI itself however does know how he did it, and hands him plans for a new version of itself.

That movie clarifies that JARVIS is merely a very sophisticated program, which is why the Vision and Ultron himself are such a big deal. Also, the fact that Ultron went feral and tried to destroy the world caused the UN to outlaw A.I. research later on in the MCU continuity, though this doesn't stop Tony Stark from building other A.I. such as Friday and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpidermanHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpidermanHomecoming">Karen.</a>

It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesSenseInContext">Makes Sense In Context</a>) who is a powerful mage, and could do, well, lots of things. Oreg (said slave) does some things of his own accord, like providing nice clothes for Ward and Ciarra, re-heating Ward's bath water, and such. He can see what is going on everywhere in castle Hurog. What does Ward ask him to do? Continue protecting Ciarra (which Oreg has been doing anyway). Some time later, Ward is told that Oreg is trained as an assassin. Ward does have political enemies, but he never once thinks of sending Oreg (who can make himself invisible and teleport) to take care of them. True, Oreg cannot be too far away from Ward, but far enough so no one would suspect <em>Ward</em>. Justified in that Ward is very different from the ancestors who had Oreg trained as an assassin, and while Ward is a good fighter, killing people just is not his favourite way of solving problems — he suffered years and years under his abusive father, who he suspected would kill him one day, and still never got the idea to kill his father first. Even though his father told him that he murdered Ward's grandfather for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a>.

He actually peers into minds all over the known universe. He also knows that the Void Which Binds, which he's connected to, was used in the past as a teleporter, and Aenea, his girlfriend/the messiah can use it. Never mind. It doesn't occur to him throughout the books that he can break out and continue writing without the threat of death by cyanide poisoning. Later, he realizes this and teleports off. Turns out he was kinda slow (and also was at the time greatly affected by the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">horrific martyrdom of Aenea</span>). Practically the whole universe had learnt to do that, and has dubbed it "freecasting", a homage to the older term "farcasting". Starships are still used by the people still loyal to the Pax, who refuse to take Communion and learn freecasting. In fact, the whole point of him writing the two books is to come to this realization.
</li><li> None of the characters in the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> ever considered that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">morphing technology</a> handed to them in the very first book, if given to the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, might solve the species-wide problem that drove them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a> in the first place? Even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they offered it to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a> Taxxons in a bid to get them to switch sides</span>? When you consider that they're constantly up against Visser Three, though, no wonder it took them ages to think of it.
<ul><li> A couple of other factors in play there, though: first, it took them forever to get their hands on a morphing cube, and once they had one, the one and only time they used it was a complete disaster, and second, it's Andalite technology, and they're desperate for Andalite help, and Andalites aren't exactly enthusiastic about letting the Yeerks use their technology, especially considering what happened the last time they tried it.
</li><li> The imperialist Yeerks would have just used it as a weapon, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were forced to permanently morph into animals at the end</span>.
</li><li> The Andalites are very guilty of this, however. Despite the fact that all their soldiers can morph, most of them never use it. It's been heavily implied that Andalite society is hamstrung by tradition, however, which might explain that.
<ul><li> More to the point, Andalites saw morphing tech as espionage technology only and that most people who would use it would only morph one or two creatures that they would specialize in. Another factor is that Earth has an insanely high bio-diversity compared to the rest of the verse. Finally, the Andalites were quite hardy fighters in their natural forms (Ax... a teen cadet... once killed a T-Rex without morphing) so weaponizing other creatures wasn't a thought for them. Visser Three's various monstrous morphs conversely were only vicious monsters that could up the stakes... he was never shown using anything for the purposes of sneaking. Only humans diversified and used morphs that would blend into various different environments.
</li></ul></li><li> After the war ended, it has become popular for rich Andalites to acquire morphing technology and visit Earth... to eat at Cinnabon.
</li><li> The Animorphs were fond of this as well. In one book, Cassie and Rachel morphed mice to get into a teacher's house and get an assignment that Cassie had doodled love letters to Jake on. In another, the gang morphed parrots to bad-mouth the food at the local Rainforest Cafe. During another outing, Ax morphed human... to go to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> Movie.
</li></ul></li><li> The Alfred Bester short story <em>Star Light, Star Bright</em> is about the pursuit of a cabal of supergenius children who have developed fantastic technology in order to deal with kid-type issues (e.g. producing sprouts that are strawberry-flavor on the inside).
<ul><li> The point being that, in a way reminiscent of idiot-savants, while they are capable of advanced theoretical, mathematical and biological leaps, they're still kids and think like kids. Ask a kid what <em>they</em> would do if given some random power/technology. Most of the time it will be precisely something of that order. Mathematics only require a knowledge of the basic rules and their extrapolation. Sociopolitical thinking (which includes the application of theoretical research) is based less on intellect and more on experience.

<ul><li> In the short story <em>The Proud Robot</em> he invented an unbelievably sophisticated singing robot with a highly intelligent (and vain) AI. The inventor couldn't get the robot to do anything he wanted because he forgot <em>why</em> he built it in the first place (he was drunk). In the climax, he remembers that he built it because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he had trouble opening a can of beer. He swore to build a bigger and better can opener; said robot is able to open beer cans with absolutely no fizz or a single drop of spilled beer</span>. The ending has the inventor becoming depressed because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">beer cans are being phased out in favor of plastic bulbs, meaning his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot">"can opener" robot</a> will be "useless"</span>.

It is used to study history by sending people and recorders to universes identical to our own except their position in time, when they could use it among other things for consulting dead people with important opinions, for duplicating rare and useful materials, for <em>immortality</em>, or <em>for bringing just about any technology that's ever going to be invented in any possible future to the present you morons!</em> It was revealed in the end that stealing future technology really <em>was</em> the plan; the historical research just was a proof-of-concept to impress the investors and a testing ground for the technology.

She has training in Elemental powers — the ability to control air, water, earth and fire. At one point Skulduggery calls her out on the fact that she's not good at manipulating water because she never practises with it, instead focusing her energy on air and fire because they're the more obvious elements to use in a fight. Skulduggery never mentions it and Valkyrie fails to add two and two, but seriously, how could she have overlooked the destructive powers of being able to control water? For crying out loud, most of the human body is water! Imagine if every bit of that water were to suddenly vanish. Or, on a more simple and brutal level, imagine filling someone's lungs with water...
</li><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Known Space</a></em> setting.
<ul><li> Thanks to ubiquitous and cheap teleporters, Earth's population becomes almost entirely homogeneous (both physically and culturally), the internal combustion engine is practically extinct, and the parts of the interstate highway system that weren't demolished and rebuilt have become parks. On the down side they deal with flash mobs and the ability of a criminal to be literally anywhere else in the world seconds after committing a crime.
</li><li> Also averted with reaction drives. At the time the Kzinti invaded, humanity had become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifists</a> and had no weapons.

Later Niven confessed that the technology would be so useful, he has to go to great lengths NOT to use it as a solution in every story.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>, where they use <em>time machines</em> so that children can take more classes than they otherwise could, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a> exists but is strangely underutilized, and so on. Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a></em>.

This one, at least, has an explanation — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the Time Turners can only bring you five hours into the past, and they do not allow the user to change the past, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">there is only one timeline</a>.
</li><li> The Room of Requirement is even guiltier since you can't even give the "it's too dangerous" excuse. A room that can respond to your request by changing itself, providing all the necessary equipment and information. Even if it cannot create things that don't already exist (like a map that marks all V's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Horcruxes</a>), the possibilities are still staggering. You could probably request a room full of gold, or lost artifacts, or weapons, or hell, maybe the cures to cancer and AIDS, while you're at it (one could argue that it does exist, we just haven't been able to put it together)! The characters spend most of the series using it as a gym, a supply closet or a storeroom, only even <em>beginning</em> to explore its true potential in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> in Hogwarts is using it as their base.
</li><li> Justified in that even Dumbledore was unaware of the Room of Requirement and only encountered it in the middle of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency">Potty Emergency</a>... when it became a room filled with chamber pots. Between the portraits that would go off and visit each other to the architecture rearranging itself on a whim, randomly stumbling upon the Room of Requirement and never seeing it again was quite possibly the only encounter people had with it for years.
</li></ul></li><li> Aversion: in the Teleporter section of the main article, there's a mention of the potential use of this for backing yourself up/making multiple copies of yourself. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross">Charles Stross</a> book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Accelerando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Accelerando">Glasshouse</a></em> did both; they massively affect society, and form major plot points. For example, changing genders is common thanks to the "reconstruct" part (making gender nouns rather confusing); "orthohuman" (standard <em>H sapiens</em> shape) and "xenohuman" (with massive bodily alterations) are normal descriptions; lethal duels are equally common so long as the participants 'saved' recently; the combination of disintegration/reconstruction transport 'gates' with memory-wipe technology resulted in <em>memory censor viruses</em> which affect anyone who uses the gate, one of which managed to pretty much wipe the reason for a whole <em>war</em> from history; and a major plotpoint involves the main character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being knocked out by a copy of <em>himself</em> (well, he's physically female at the time, but he seems to identify as male for the most part), thanks to the 'original' being brainwashed with one of those memory worms.</span>
<ul><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> moment, there's a short section pointing out that the <em>really</em> important part of a person is their mind, so when a group of soldiers are sending people through the gate to be be mentally tweaked, they realize that sending through prisoners one at a time is taking too long since it takes a while to process the entire body. So they start beheading prisoners and tossing the heads into the gate, as the smaller physical size allows for faster processing and hey, they're getting a new body anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Charles Stross's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMerchantPrincesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMerchantPrincesSeries">The Merchant Princes Series</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">plays with</a> this trope. Members of the Clan have the ability to teleport between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">alternate timelines</a>, along with whatever they can carry. They use it to get rich in modern America by smuggling drugs through a world with a feudal culture that lacks a DEA, and in that feudal culture they use their ability to get rich by bringing in modern innovations like penicillin and automatic guns. That's a very practical application of the phlebotinum, compared to many examples on this page, like robbing banks, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing">Green Lantern Ring</a> superpowers just for fighting, or using dinosaurs as the main attraction in an amusement park. However, after a modern business journalist learns about the system she quickly points out that mercantilism is a very old-fashioned, zero-sum economic theory and there are much better things the Clan could be doing with their time, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingRadioToTheRomans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingRadioToTheRomans">Giving Radio to the Romans</a>.

Subverted by the doctor, who wanted to find a way to use the technique to help people with disabilities like blindness be able to live normal lives, but played straight by Henry, who picks up the technique to win in casinos. He later subverts it himself, when he is bored and rich and decides to dedicate his life to winning money and donating it to various orphanages and charities.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetSpaceship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetSpaceship">Great Ship</a> is so durable because it has a hull several kilometers thick made entirely out of ultra high-grade hyperfiber.

It wasn't until much later that they realized they'd created an interdimensional transporter. This novel also showed <em>why</em> using such a device as a planetary-scale garbage disposal might not be a good idea: they eventually discovered that the "garbage" and pollution they were getting rid of included important trace elements of their atmosphere. And since they'd also unknowingly destroyed all of their planet's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">dilithium crystals</a> long ago, before realizing their importance, they didn't have the means to evacuate more than a small fraction of their population.

Davis and Chaz repeatedly discuss the idea of finding something more useful to do with it, but they can't think of anything much better than just letting the Snapshot run for years to see what happens. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The government is using it for spying and more important murder investigations</span>.

<ul><li> Averted in the case of replicators; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> as depicted is an example of a moneyless socialist society, sometimes regarded as a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_scarcity">post-scarcity economy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Federation citizens do still work, but they do so to 'better themselves' and contribute to society. From the Next Generation series onwards, replicators make everything you need - for an energy input. In a normal space opera you might need some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">suspension of disbelief</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaving</a> to explain why replicators don't cause the economy to collapse, however, in a post-capitalist utopian society, the problem doesn't exist.
<ul><li> The replicators also get more and more limited as the franchise goes on. For instance you can replicate food, but a homecooked meal or restaurant will taste better. It's also inefficent enough that in early seasons of <em>Deep Space Nine</em> Bajor was struggling with famines, even though they have both replicators and Federation foreign aid. Torpedoes are manufactured traditionally and stored on ships until use, not replicated as needed. Even the Federation is criss-crossed by trade lanes as goods are moved from one side of the galaxy to the other, and a few races build their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRaceGuy">whole</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidMerchant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidMerchant">culture</a> around the fact that trade is still important. (As one <em>Star Trek</em> producer put it, a society that can replicate a starship is a society that doesn't <em>need</em> starships.)
</li></ul></li><li> Another case is the holodeck. One may assume there are people who have taken to just living permanent lives of leisure in a holodeck, but again, they aren't shown on-screen because that would be boring. Recurring character Reginald Barclay's ongoing struggle with "holo-addiction" points out why you don't want that sort of thing going on when you're supposed to be busy exploring the galaxy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing">making friends with aliens</a>.

They are also afflicted with a disease that devours their organs one by one, and which for reasons that are never explained adapts too quickly for them to cure. They use their hyperadvanced medicine to murder people and steal their organs. In "Faces", it's definitively established that they can create clones through transporter technology. Given an IQ higher than seven, they could use this to produce organ-harvest clones, which may be something of an ethical minefield but has to be miles ahead of <em>murdering people and stealing their organs</em>. Mind you, Voyager is no stranger to this trope; in "Prime Factors", the Sikarians have a teleporter that can reach planets <em>forty thousand light years</em> distant, which they use exactly once in the episode - to allow one of them to go on a romantic walk with Harry Kim. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0omyq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0omyq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0omyq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Naturally, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a>, it's incompatible with Federation technology so that the cast can't apply it in a way that actually makes sense.</span>
<ul><li> The Vidiians would need pure tissue to be able to clone to cure the Phage and their entire race is infected. One does wonder, though, what will happen now that the Think Tank has cured the Phage. As for the Sikarians, they also have a rule similar to the Prime Directive that forbids them from sharing their technology. And surely the Sikarians use it plenty.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a>.</em> When a character is discovered to have mind control abilities, he is asked why he is only using it to live a lower middle class life and to obtain some weed, get laid, and a couple cool things like a rare car, as opposed to something more grand like world conquest. He replies by claiming that he has everything he would ever want.
</li><li> Buffy Summers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> acquired the ability to read minds. Giles suggested using it for gathering intelligence against her enemies... but Buffy's response was "Way better than that," and she used it to investigate the petty personal questions of how people think about her. Of course, like most magic in Sunnydale, it goes horribly wrong. It ended up being a moot point anyway, since she couldn't control it and vampires were immune.

Studying just the human body opens up fields like medicine (cure diseases, extend lifespans), neurology/psychology (figure out how the <em>non-superpower</em> parts of the brain work—consciousness anyone?), and genetics (genotype interaction). However, this may result from the fact that Sylar is <em>insane</em>. In Season 3, Peter takes Sylar's power in order to understand the show's plot.

Given the alternative, a lot of people would probably take the offer.
<ul><li> Used and abused for this purpose in the spin-off novel <em>Hydra</em>; the NID acquire the templates for the robo-SG-1 and create various subtly-reprogrammed versions of the team to try and do the job that the NID feels the SGC should be doing, such as taking technology from other societies regardless of the cost. This plan backfires as the various duplicates come to resent feeling like slaves, culminating in the creation of the psychopathic 'theta team'.

The Wraith rather quickly figured out a way to "jam" the teleportation, but they lost a big number of their otherwise extremely powerful Hive ships before that happened. It's eventually revealed that the likely reason they had a fix available so quickly is because they've encountered this tactic before - with the Vanir, a less ethical Asgard offshoot hiding out in the Pegasus Galaxy.
</li><li> An episode had the team discover an abandoned experiment by the Ancients to replace the Zero-Point Modules (which create enormous power by extracting vacuum-energy from a tiny pocket of subspace) with a reactor that extracts vacuum-energy from our own universe. The problem is that in the process, it creates exotic particles that completely ignore our universe's laws of physics. Turning the experiment back on eventually results in an explosion that wipes out most of a (fortunately uninhabited) solar system. The Atlantis Expedition later tries to create a scaled-down reactor that solves the exotic particle problem by shunting the particles to another universe (which they figure is probably uninhabited anyway). But, it turns out the other universe IS inhabited, and they take exception to being our universe's dumping grounds, so it gets shut down again.

At first glance, the eponymous Dollhouse appears to be flagrantly misusing their tech to run what essentially amounts to a high-tech brothel/thieves' guild/assassination broker that manufactures tailored agents. However, as the series progresses, we see the other uses of the tech, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mass-producing hive-minded supersoldiers, and weaponized use of imprinting/wiping signals across radios/telephones as weapons of mass destruction.</span> Averted by Topher during the second season when he reinvents his designs for Rossum specifically so that they can't be used for any other purpose than they are designed for.

However, there is an episode where the time travelers encounter alien invaders that <em>embodies</em> this trope. The aliens have working teleporters that do not appear to need a transmitter or a receiver. They have orders to raid the Earth for protein. They do this by attacking a town and forcing them to give them meat. They could have just stolen the food with a teleporter, or stolen a herd of cows, or abducted a school of fish!

This would revolutionize the space program, and what does he do with it? Screen crappy movies. Similarly, Joel was able to build three robots with true, if not overly sophisticated, artificial intelligences. What does he do with them? Provide companionship so that he doesn't have to sit through those movies alone.

The film features a scientist who claims to be working on a radio that can talk to the dead.

Every human has their mind stored on a cortical stack which can be removed and placed in a new body (called a sleeve).

Cloned sleeves are considered extremely expensive, so much so that only the elite can afford them while everyone else has to make do with what's available, with healthy and young bodies being bought up by relatively wealthy individuals. Of course, the whole system also serves to keep society both stable and the elite in power while true immortality for the masses might lead to upheavals and resource shortages.

Then the Protectorate started using it for conquest (they keep blank sleeves on a planet, then cast into them when needed), and the wealthy manipulated things so that they were the only ones who could live forever.

<ul><li> First off, it should be noted that the nature of tabletop gaming as a medium makes any individual example here a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> once the players get involved; <em>individual games</em> have entire internet threads devoted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">creative and unorthodox ways</a> players have used their abilities, so you can bet that any example on the list below or that you can think of has not only been thought of by someone out there at some point, but also has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">mercilessly exploited</a> by another to the point of taking things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>:
<ul><li> The supplement <em>SuperTemps</em> was filled with supers who used their powers for things like sanitation and garbage disposal, medicine, being a courier, or being a security expert.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> International Super Teams</em> incorporated <em>SuperTemps</em> into its setting, and expanded upon it. And the <em>I.S.T</em>. chapter of <em>GURPS Y2K</em> had detailed passages on supers using their powers for construction and other mundane occupations. And not-so-mundane UN-sponsored occupations, like weather control (to divert destructive hurricanes, alleviate drought, and so forth) and famine relief ("You can make plants grow? Come with me!").
</li></ul></li><li> Most magicians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em> behave this way, one major reason why some of the most powerful canon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> are almost completely mundane. The rulebooks frequently mention adepts using their earth-shattering powers and ancient mystic rituals to beat up ex-boyfriends or acquire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> paraphernalia. Since step one to being an adept is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">become cripplingly obsessed and insane</a>...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>
<ul><li> Clerics can <em>make water materialize out of thin air</em> and <em>purify huge amounts of existing water</em>. Rather than, you know, revolutionizing agriculture and sea travel, they primarily use this ability to reduce the amount of canteens parties of adventurers have to lug around.
<ul><li> Given how frequently those spells can be cast (and require a rather powerful priest to begin with), they mostly end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>. Magic items (<em>Decanter of Endless Water</em>, <em>Urn of Water Purification</em>) are better, but expensive. In the same way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPhlebotinum">magic-rich</a> settings like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Netheril</a> may have full sets of plane-gating plumbing.
</li><li> Due to the nature of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em>, Create Water was reduced to a fraction of its normal efficiency in the setting from the start. It was better than nothing, but it wouldn't save anyone unless you were both high level and devoted a lot of spell slots to it. The game designers wanted an apocalyptic setting where the players actually had to struggle.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally, D&amp;D magic easily lends itself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> - a permanent area of reverse gravity with a flywheel half inside is a perpetual motion machine, conjuring water and fire (or ready steam) allows compact steam machines never running out of fuel, etc. It's used more frequently than purposefully averted, but still not all that much.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?t=109791">Tippyverse<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a hypothetical setting where every piece of phlebotinum is pushed to its ultimate limit. In a world ruled by wizards, spells are "trapped" in push-button <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> machines that act as food dispensers, showers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">training dummy makers</a> for grinding experience, emergency rooms, transport, and more.
</li><li> Some D&amp;D settings have quite a number of standing, stable, permanent teleportation circles for fast travel across a continent. While adventurers may use them as an excuse for a quick adventure in Exotic Location XYZ and then return to normal afterward, you'd think that there'd be a whole lineup of traders using them as well... not to mention diplomats, spies, and wealthy tourists...
</li><li> "Speak with Dead" is a 2nd level cleric spell, "Raise Dead" is only 5th level, and various magic items such as a Ring of Truth exist that either grant the user the ability to detect lies and/or force a suspect to tell the truth. Unless it's a setting where mages/clerics are very rare, it has pretty big repercussions on a lot of crime, at least the kind major enough to be noticed by the authorities... better hide your tracks REALLY well, or else be out of the city!
</li><li> Somewhat justified, "Speak With Dead" and "Raise Dead" both require a mostly intact corpse, so mutilating the body can severely hamper investigations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> actually uses magic spells reasonably effectively: almost every settlement above a certain size has at least some areas lit by <em>continual flame</em>, people with Use Magic Device are formed up into squads on the battlefield to fire off wands, and there's an entire mercenary regiment based on providing <em>summon monster</em> spells in tactically useful situations. Then there are the Dragonmarked Houses, who use their marks' innate gifts and the access to specialist magic items they provide, to make staggering amounts of money, to the point where some of the Houses are the most powerful forces on Khorvaire now that the united Galifar government no longer exists.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>, the city of Ravens Bluff is home to a pair of of brothers who found themselves receiving as their inheritance not a fortune in gold coins, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer">Major Helm</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">magitek</a> artifact that can turn any sailing vessel it's attached to into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship">Cool Airship</a> capable of <em>interstellar flight</em>. Major helms are the most powerful kind, and literally worth a king's ransom. The brothers have put this tremendous power that could conceivably make them wealthier than emperors to use... for running a traveling circus that flies around what is barely a portion of a single continent on their world. Oh, and sometimes taking ladies on moonlight cruises.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">using Wonders for mundane tasks</a> is a minor Transgression. In most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a> gamelines, using your magic powers for mundane tasks is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> violation. But it's usually one so small that only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">living saint</a> would even need to roll for degeneration for doing it.
</li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChuubosMarvelousWishGrantingEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChuubosMarvelousWishGrantingEngine">Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine</a></em>. Chuubo (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Shokyou</a>, if you prefer the female version) uses his, well, marvelous wish-granting engine...to try and get ice cream, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">never works</a>, and occasionally do other things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">make seagulls cooler</a>. Of course, Chuubo is in his early teens; Fortitude is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia">already pretty idyllic</a>; and anything Chuubo does that doesn't show up on the Wishing Map <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">tends to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">backfire</a>, so no wonder he doesn't try to use it for anything more spectacular.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SteambotChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SteambotChronicles">Steambot Chronicles</a></em>: The Killer Elephants have a large organization with extensive industrial production, able to mass-produce the mecha they use, and even a giant mecha. What do they do with all these resources? They rob passing travelers. True, they're just trying to get funding for their true project, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> flying to the moon</span>, but with a setup like theirs, they really should be doing something more profitable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em>'s Aperture Science, the company behind the insanity at the heart of the plot, is almost entirely built on this trope.
<ul><li> Originally contracted to create shower curtains for the Army, Aperture patented their portal gun technology, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportGun">Teleport Gun</a> that doesn't teleport directly, but allows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkingUpPortals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkingUpPortals">Thinking Up Portals</a>, as a "man-sized ad-hoc quantum tunnel through physical space <em>with possible applications as a shower curtain</em>." This is a device that breaks the laws of thermodynamics, implicitly allows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>, and would revolutionize the world, and it gets used to run hapless test subjects through mazes like lab rats.
</li><li> GLaDOS, a fully sentient AI, was originally designed as a <em>fuel line de-icer</em>. She was also designed in apparent ignorance of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant">Three Laws</a>, as shortly after she was turned on, she found a way to murder nearly every scientist in the facility.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> reveals that most of Aperture Science's products fall into this trope:
<ul><li> Aerial Faith Plates - Compact and quite powerful catapults capable of launching adult humans dozens of feet into the air. Marketed as truck cargo loading devices, despite being WAY too powerful for that, causing the cargo to be damaged and/or bounced right back out of the truck.
</li><li> Thermal Discouragement Beams - Semi-lethal laser beams. Marketed as means to keep office workers from <em>leaving their desks</em>.
</li><li> Repulsion and Propulsion Gels - Gels literally capable of breaking the laws of physics by making any surface in which they are spread suddenly gain elasticity or make any object in contact with that surface <em>gain momentum</em> respectively. Marketed as <em>dietary aids</em> despite being <em>horrifically toxic</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutShoes">The Long Fall Boot</a> — a "foot-based suit of armor for the Portal Device." Something that lets human beings fall up to <em>500 ft</em> and land without a scratch? It was only used to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd1m5_n9P9w">prevent a reproducible human error problem when the test subjects fell too far, broke their legs (at best), which made them drop the gun and break expensive equipment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> And then there's the stuff that was apparently <em>never released at all</em>: solar powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> bridges, tractor beams capable of sending things forward or backward, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a>, enough technology to create a facility literally capable of surviving the Apocalypse, repair and literally <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaosArchitecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaosArchitecture">rearrange itself at will</a></em>, sentient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> capable of running with voltage sources as low as <em>1.1 volts</em>, selective disintegration... all this used for no other purpose than testing.
</li><li> And now, the Perpetual Testing Initiative demonstrates that Aperture developed interdimensional travel (apparently reliable, at least as much as any of their other products), and decided to use it to get other Apertures in parallel universes to build test chambers for them. This is like having a key that can open any lock and using it to steal office supplies.
<ul><li> At least "Cave Prime" manages to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find a universe <em>literally made of money</em> with it</span>, so it wasn't a <em>total</em> waste.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Averted to an incredible degree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>: almost everything in the universe runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyParticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyParticle">eezo</a>-based technology, from artificial gravity and FTL travel to miniature railguns and telekinesis. Hell, one of your crew members in the third game has an eezo <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">toothbrush</a></em>. The writers even remembered to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> away FTL ramming.
</li><li> The Weavers Guild in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Loom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Loom">Loom</a></em> can manipulate the fabric of time and space. They mostly use this power for... spinning and dying clothing. Or so it seems to a casual outside observer.
<ul><li> Actually they can become immortal and turn the insides of small tents into roomy houses and one cathedral-sized temple. And then they used it to observe the nature of the universe and trace a discord that threatened to destroy everything. Weaving cloth is just how they got started.
</li><li> More specifically, each of the guilds in Loom derives its supernatural abilities from a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a> related to their original mundane role. The glassmakers make infinitely sharp glass edges and crystal balls that see the future; the Weavers went from weaving cloth to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">weaving reality</a>. But they still stick to their roots.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">According to the manual</a>, the use of some drafts is strictly regulated, because they may put other Guilds out of work or collapse the economy with cheap gold.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerQuest">Power Quest</a></em> there exist little remote controlled robots capable of firing ki blasts out of their palms. And yet no one thinks to scale these up for military use; no, they're much better as children's toys.
</li><li> Naoya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em> creates both a demon summoning program and a harmonizer that lessens blows to the user and increases those from the user, especially against demons. While the demon summoning program is rightfully considered a big deal in universe, the harmonizer gets less press, despite seemingly allowing its user to shrug off gun wounds.
<ul><li> Considering the circumstances, however, people may simply be assuming the two functions are connected, and with the problems the <em>former</em> is causing... On a related note, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Atsuro</span> comes to think that the demons themselves are Misapplied Phlebotinum, and wants to take the summoner's control over them even further.
</li><li> There is an ending path where Our Heroes attempt to just massacre the JSDF and walk out of the city, braving the bullets, implying that such a feat might be doable for lategame characters, but not new users of the app? Who knows.
</li></ul></li><li> The Black Spider ninjas' motivation for trying to steal the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Dark Dragon Blade</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a></em>? Their leader wanted to grind it up to make <em>tea</em>. Granted, he believed drinking tea made from dragon bones (which the Dark Dragon Blade was forged from) would empower him...but still, <em>tea?</em>
</li><li> PR0XY, the cheerfully homicidal (to Galen at least) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">Robot Buddy</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em>. Vader created a droid that could, with the proper modules, copy the techniques and appearance of any Jedi, somehow produces lightsabers from nowhere, and can even replicate <em>Force abilities</em> with repulsor technology. And Vader uses it as a communications device and as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> tool. As opposed to mass producing a droid Jedi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> army.
<ul><li> Droids can be sliced and reprogrammed. And Jedi/Sith can't sense them, so they'd be more of a threat than thousand of disposable soldier who can't even aim properly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> both follows and averts this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">The 'Verse</a> is filled with these insanely powerful creatures, who mostly serve as combatants between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKidWithTheRemoteControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKidWithTheRemoteControl">children with voice commands</a>. They have also, however, been show to do more practical things.
<ul><li> For example, right at the beginning of one game, some superhumanly strong Machokes are moving boxes into your house with ease. They are also used in construction. Miltank are used for dairy production, grass types in perfume manufacturing, and electric types are used in power plants for organic, completely ecologically-friendly energy production.
</li><li> A better example would be the online storage systems. These store and teleport hundreds of living creatures (and in some games furniture and dolls as well). These could surely be used as houses, storing populations of whole countries.
</li><li> With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">Video Game</a>/PokémonSwordAndShield</em> they've finally caught on, as starting with that generation there is now an entire mechanic revolving around renting the services of your mons out to various buisnesses based on their typing, such as renting fire pokemon to chefs.
</li></ul></li><li> In the setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> the technology exists to digitally decode DNA and to deconstruct solid matter into a format for digital storage and reverse the process without limit. Use in-game? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justifying</a> the game's respawn mechanic and why players can carry 20 rifle-sized weapons and none of them show. Later games show more restrictions on digistruct technology, including the fact that you need to have a copy of what you're making plus raw materials to build it out of to recreate it, and even then, the technology is so expensive that very few people have the equipment to digistruct something bigger than a car. Large things such as buildings, spacecraft, or space stations require more conventional construction techniques. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands3">Borderlands 3</a></em>, we also start seeing more complex and extensive use of digistructing technology, especially by the Maliwan corporation, who use it extensively to essentially teleport troops and weapons via pylons that can be dropped from ships in orbit, and Rhys even uses it to digistruct a <em>mustache</em> onto his face.
</li><li> A particularly hilarious and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">acknowledged</a> version of this occurs in a codex entry in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>: before the creation of the Circle of Magi, the Chantry employed mages <em>exclusively</em> for lighting sacred candles and lamps in their churches. And occasionally sweeping up. Eventually, the mages of Val Royeux's cathedral snuffed out their lamps in protest and demanded that their services be put to better use; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Divine</a> responded by ordering an Exalted March (i.e.: a crusade) on her own cathedral, which was only prevented by her Templars pointing out what a patently insane idea this was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>. The vast and varied potential applications for some of the characters' powers are mind-boggling, yet due to laziness, selfishness, or sheer stupidity none of them even consider what they could accomplish.
<ul><li> The most obvious example is also the most explainable: Yakumo Yukari can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">do basically anything</a>, but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy">usually too lazy to bother</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Izayoi Sakuya</a>, the time (and space) manipulating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">maid</a> of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, uses her abilities to...clean. Granted, with a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">fairy maids</a> as co-workers, it'd be quite a big hassle otherwise...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Cirno</a> can basically invent air conditioning by herself and seems like she should be able to freeze any opponent solid in an instant, but that's no fun.
</li><li> Kanako builds a fancy new nuclear fusion plant to produce free electricity (sure!), and... create hot gas for her Hisoutensoku balloon?

The comic is set in a world where the utterly bizarre coexists comfortably with the mundane and reasonable, so weird stuff gets used for even weirder purposes:
<ul><li> The main character is, essentially, a powerful ninja superhero who has chosen to go into a medical career instead of becoming an assassin like his parents explicitly trained him to.
</li><li> A group of Mexican criminals have found a pack of surviving velociraptors. They use this monumental discovery worth millions to rob people like stereotypical banditos from an old western movie.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://drmcninja.com/archives/comic/13p9">This gem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: "James! The leader of our group. He invented jet boots, and he used them to kick people."
</li><li> Martin is basically the Hulk and uses his great powers to...advertise his chain of super-markets. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oh, and do work for the mafia</span>.
</li><li> Easily topping all the other examples is King Radical's use of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Portal</a> for <a class="urllink" href="http://drmcninja.com/archives/comic/21p36/">garbage disposal.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> And a septic tank, somehow.

<ul><li> The Wormgates themselves can be considered an evil aversion of this trope as well: after all as long as people are seen going in one place and coming out the other, there's nothing to worry about what goes on in between...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">right?</a>
</li><li> And even before the introduction of the Teraport there was the ubiquitous gravitic technology; if you have gravity manipulation<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ojw5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ojw5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ojw5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not creation, just manipulating the gravity generated by a sphere of Neutronium</span> on your ship then you already have forcefields, tractor-beams and a reactionless drive as well.
<ul><li> ...not to mention the ability to rip other ships apart with a careful application of gravitics.
</li><li> They're also nicknamed "gravy guns" because it's possible to liquefy the crew while leaving the hull intact.
</li></ul></li><li> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from a big gun."
</li><li> An old weapon becomes a significant plot element when it combines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">FTL communications</a> with high-powered energy weapons to create a hyperspace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Ray</a>. A weapon that can teleport tremendous firepower to any known location regardless of defenses without revealing the location of the weapon.

<ul><li> Eventually it becomes possible to track the location of the weapon - after it was fired.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive">El Goonish Shive</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tedd uses his ultrapowerful transformation gun to throw a party for his girlfriend and switch genders so that he can cook. Though, considering that Tedd's dad is the head of the local MIB, he can't really sell or distribute the technology without getting grounded for, say, ten thousand years or so. The origin story for the gun reveals Tedd only has it because one of his Dad's alien buddies needed some simple work done on it, and their culture has religious objections to object-oriented programming. For the setting it's such basic tech to anyone not limited to human-made stuff that it isn't even worth being careful with; magic can do the same thing (if less reliably) and several races have it as an in-built ability. The main characters were not aware of this part until quite a ways into the story, though. Tedd and his friends occasionally do break out the transformation equipment for more practical purposes, like to turn Elliot into a werecat for getting places faster.
</li><li> This is also a universe where every major government has a dedicated (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">albeit secret</a>) magic agency. Just because <em>Tedd's</em> not applying the phlebotinum doesn't mean somebody isn't.

Should someone reveal the existence and accessibility of magic to the world, magic would rewrite its own rules so that nobody knew how it worked anymore. It <em>can't</em> be used to solve widespread world problems because it would stop working if someone tried to do that.

Only a freshman at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool">Whateley Academy</a>, he's already going around getting inventors to sign up with his financial service and marketing their inventions to fix this problem. Bugs had a weird gadget that faked painting on stuff: Phase saw how to turn it into the best toy ever. Jericho had some stuff that Phase is trying to patent and turn into the best medikit in the world. Loophole had a gadget that helped her get awesome performance out of her self-built car: Phase wants to market it as a way of cranking up automotive fuel efficiency world-wide.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SpacebattlesDotCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SpacebattlesDotCom">Spacebattles</a> posters like to accuse various factions of being guilty of this trope with regards to using their abilities or technology. They go on to suggest better alternatives and ways of averting this rope. In turn, some other posters go to lengths to try to argue otherwise and demonstrate why the Phlebotinum isn't being Misapplied. A quote follows. It's gotten to the point that "competence" has become something of a slur due to inciting violent arguments.
<div class="indent"> <strong><a class="urllink" href="http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/how-would-nbsg-have-been-like-if-its-ftl-was-used-properly.219280/page-2#post-7474430">Nattuo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:</strong> Obviously, we should use bad analogies to imply whenever we see the technology not doing the thing we want it to it's just that they've dialed it down because they're all just incompetents. Being so dumb they probably don't even know the dial goes up that high, you know, because they're dumb. Not at all like us. <br/>This is obviously because we have such stupendously vast mental faculties we can instantly see all the hidden factors to a technology's operation when we're shown a single — or extremely limited — instance of its usage, and can predict exactly how it completely changes the nature of the setting (in spite of it not doing so) and use that to deduce the residents of the setting are just dumb (because of the aforementioned failure to completely understand all the hidden factors in their technology that allows us to foresee such usage methodologies with our incredible intellect). <br/>Hence, even with them working with said technology every single day, and having built said technology, and having a functioning understanding of all the engineering aspects of said technology, we understand it better than them, despite lacking all these things. We're just that fucking clever.
</div></li><li> While many of the artifacts contained by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a> are dangerous, a number of them are quite useful. The Foundation is aware of this, and those objects safe enough to be used without harm they <em>do</em> put to use in various capacities. They haven't released these things to the public largely because they want to be sure they understand the underlying mechanisms of how exactly they work first.
<ul><li> SCP-914. A large clockwork device covering 18 square meters. Items put into a slot are altered according to one of five parameters set: Rough, Coarse, 1:1, Fine and Very Fine. The Rough and Coarse settings tend to destroy items or reduce them to their base material components, the 1:1 returns a different object of equivalent worth and purpose, but the Fine and Very Fine return significantly better items of greater quality or complexity. A gun put into the machine, with the Fine or Very Fine setting, would return an even better gun, possibly even stuff beyond SCP's current tech level. The main problem with the above is that SCP-914 itself is sentient and tends to troll people on a regular basis, producing actively harmful end results, and even if it's feeling co-operative that day and because it was apparently created as something that could produce novel new things instead of something that's primarily intended to disassemble or improve items placed in it, you never know if the weapon you feed into it on Fine or Very Fine setting will produce a better weapon of the same type, a technically better but ludicrously difficult-to-operate variant of the weapon or an aggressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robot</a> roughly based on the weapon's design that then proceeds to kill everyone in the room. However, even the 1:1 setting is fairly useful, as it could potentially provide translations of writings in an unknown language, which they have done some experiments on in the past.
</li><li> SCP-294. A vending machine capable of producing <em>any</em> liquid that exists in this universe, as well as a few that don't. The Foundation uses it as... well, a vending machine for the facility it's stored in (albeit with some armed guards who make sure nobody tries anything stupid and/or dangerous with it, like ordering liquid antimatter or something).
</li><li> SCP-458 is a Little Caesar's pizza box that produces unlimited quantities of pizza (of the preferred flavor of whomever touches it). The Foundation has put it in the staff room of that facility to save on catering costs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Atomic Rockets</em> has an entire chapter on Unintended Consequences (and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/respectscience.php">links directly to this page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).
<ul><li> Sufficiently powerful sub-light engines work out to, basically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KzintiLesson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KzintiLesson">riding around on the recoil of a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>. A beam of superhot "Fuck everything and everyone behind me" comes out the ass-end of the ship and the ship goes the other way at a gravity or two. This has two outcomes: The government sticks a kill switch on every ship with such an engine, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingPostal">a disgruntled employee realizes that he's got, basically, a nuclear weapon in his back pocket</a> (and <em>then</em> the government installs the kill-switches once everything's calmed down)
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator">Matter Replicator</a> would absolutely destroy the economy, since you can just make whatever you want at the touch of a button (or verbal order; in fact that's exactly what happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> and why Federation citizens work to better society rather than accumulate wealth). Likewise, quantum computing, since the stock market's computer network <em>needs</em> processor delays to work right (and QC would also ruin all security measures for the same reason).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">Subspace Ansible</a> would remove the need for manned spaceflight by making it a better idea to just send robots. Steady advances in the reliability of long-range communications for remote control are half the reason most of our probes and satellites are unmanned <em>now</em>.

The first video makes it clear that since their tech is dubiously legal, to the point they refuse to acknowledge it exists, they just didn't have any better ideas.
</li><li> Captain Hammer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DrHorriblesSingAlongBlog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DrHorriblesSingAlongBlog">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a></em> is mentioned by Dr. Horrible as being "corporate"; presumably he takes sponsorships.

<ul><li> The premise behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chaotic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chaotic">Chaotic</a></em> is that it can create an identical duplicate you to live out a real world version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradingCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradingCardGame">Trading Card Game</a>. You can 'port out' and the duplicate's memories are reabsorbed into you. While the show managed to show a wheelchair bound player walking inside the simulation, they ignored a more obvious application of their technology: Immortality.
<ul><li> What about halving the time you need to spend studying, by having each half study, well, half. Not to mention if, say, you ported out -in the middle of a test-
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title character once created an orbital satellite station that sucked out all the water from the city, gathered it into a giant balloon, and dropped it for no other reason than to win a water balloon fight.
</li><li> A massive robot obviously capable of obliterating everything in its path is used by Zim to get revenge on Dib for a few off-hand comments made earlier in the episode.
</li><li> Zim tries to get revenge on Dib for throwing a muffin at him. Zim gets Dib trapped—there's no escape, Dib's got a massive laser cannon aimed straight at his head—and what does Zim do? He has the cannon fire another muffin—not even a massive muffin, just a normal muffin roughly equivalent to the one Dib threw at him. And then lets Dib go on his merry way.
</li><li> Zim has a device that can take out human organs and substitute them with...stuff...and what does he do with it? He uses it to stuff himself full of human organs in case the <strike>school</strike> skool nurse decides to do an x-ray. Never mind sucking the brains out of the entire human populace—what if Zim needs to see a doctor?
</li><li> Perhaps the most bizarre by far—Zim has a device that can submit humans to the most painful mental torture possible, and uses it to hypnotize the town's populace into <em>helping him win a school fundraiser.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in the episode "Jail Bird" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em>; Negaduck is continually frustrated that Megavolt, Bushroot and the Liquidator are too stupid to make full use of their superpowers. (Although, thanks to a power-stealing emerald, Negaduck ultimately doesn't fare much better.)
</li><li> So many gadgets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> could probably qualify, seeing as some of them have been shown to shrink things, tear holes between dimensions, or simulate ghost powers for a human (intangibility and flight included), and there is at least one vehicle made by the Fenton parents that can float in the air even when it is not running. All of this stuff is used for is hunting and catching ghosts nothing more.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one Halloween episode, Homer buys a teleporter from Prof. Frink and uses it to get food from the fridge without leaving the couch. Marge draws the line at using the teleporter as a shortcut to the toilet.
</li><li> Another Halloween episode has Lisa and Bart develop superpowers. Bart vows to uses his powers (stretching) "only to annoy", and proceeds to pull a prank on Skinner.
</li><li> Yet another Halloween episode shows what each Simpson (aside from Marge) would do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonkeysPaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonkeysPaw">The Monkey's Paw</a>. Homer wishes for...a sandwich. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">This was not without reason</a>; he'd just seen the Paw mess things up twice before hand, so he tried to make a "safe" wish, specifying it as much as he could to make sure it wouldn't go wrong. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It didn't work; the turkey was <em>a little dry</em>.</span>

In one particular incident, he created a machine that could remove zinc from water as the first stage of a circuitous plot that even he couldn't remember all the details of. Considering that zinc is fairly useful metal, he could have just cornered the world zinc market, made a lot of money, and done so legally at that.
<ul><li> Another plan that stands out was inventing a machine that could translate between English and Whale. His evil plan was to insult a specific whale. Perry didn't even bother to foil him that time, he just shook his head and went home.
</li></ul></li><li> On the PBS cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em> the villainous Dr. Two-Brains builds a ray which can make gold into cheese (he's obsessed with cheese) and a second one which can turn potato salad into gold. He <em>steals</em> potato salad to turn into gold and then into cheese. Not only WordGirl but even the <em>announcer</em> think this is the stupidest plan ever — why not just turn potato salad into gold and <em>buy more potato salad?</em>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>:
<ul><li> One example is that cash money has become obsolete, but the writers apparently didn't understand how digital currency transfers work, so you get things like people stealing shipments of little green 'cash cards,' or running a 'cash card' through one of those little handheld beeper thingies and getting the correct amount in the read-out, but the card gets stolen back and apparently the money's still on it.
</li><li> The various incarnations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedDrug">G-Rated Drug</a> in the franchise are often subject to this as well, but the Venom 'slappers' are kind of an aversion—the stuff Bane used to dope up on to make him the man who broke Batman has now been commercialized as a street drug. Bad, yes, but kind of realistic.
</li><li> The future has hovercars, but they work about the same as regular cars, and pretty much all that's different is that youthful self-destructive behavior is more colorful.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus">The Magic School Bus</a></em> has the titular bus,which can reach distant planets and the bottom of oceans in barely anytime at all. Instead of using this to colonise or exploit resources, it's used to give a few kids an educational joyride.

They only use it once, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">at night</a></em>, to creep up on the resting Autobots... but not to kill them, only to mess around with their recharging chambers and make them evil. Later it also turns out that while the invisibility — somehow — renders them undetectable to the "evil presence" scanners of the Autobot ship, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleInvisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleInvisibility">security cameras can still see their outlines</a>.

</li><li> Not that the others were much better. Each carried a ring capable of using the classical elements to impressive degrees, but the never bothered to use them to their full potential.
</li><li> Hell, they had technology like a solar-powered plane, but no one ever thought to showcase it to the world to help reduce the dependency on fossil fuels.

Then again, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> as the show was, pretty much every misuse of technology was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> for how it COULD have been used.
