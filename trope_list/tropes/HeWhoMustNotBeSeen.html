<ul><li> As a rule of thumb, The Emperor of Japan (both the living, historical, or even fictitious ones) is never shown or even mentioned in any Japanese media other than news stories or story books. See this <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysanthemum_taboo">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for details. On the other hand, they don't have any qualms to show any daimyo, shogun or even Prime Ministers (both historical and fictitious) in any kind of light. Some clever writers manage to include an equivalent of the Japanese Imperial Family through some good writing:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade">Queen's Blade</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> of Japan, Hinomoto, has an Emperor, who is a girl.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats">Samurai Pizza Cats</a></em> at least between the Japanese and American versions: Little Tokyo is ruled by a brainless emperor in the American iteration, but the character is described as a Shogun in the original Japanese airings.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAmbitionOfOdaNobuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAmbitionOfOdaNobuna">The Ambition of Oda Nobuna</a></em> with Himiko, who is also a girl by making her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a>: She is "the head of Yamato court" and said to be an incarnation of the Gods who built Japan, something any Japanese would immediately associated with the empress—but she was <em>never</em> referred to as the empress of Japan. She's also notable to be the <em>only character</em> of the series when the number or fan-art (erotic or otherwise) about her can be counted with a <em>single hand</em>.
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarukanaruTokiNoNakaDe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarukanaruTokiNoNakaDe">Harukanaru Toki no Naka de</a></em> manga for the original game. The Emperor of the parallel Heian Japan-like universe face is seen when he speaks with his brother Eisen - we even see him give Eisen advice on how to interact with Akane.
</li><li> Averted with a revenge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Angolmois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Angolmois">Angolmois</a></em> when the historical Emperor Tokihito (Antoku) appears, at least in the animated adaptation, something really unusual for an modern adaptation of an anime series.
</li></ul></li><li> Like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> example below, there are few, if any parents shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys">Daily Lives of High School Boys</a></em>, even though they are mentioned or alluded to at various points in the series.
</li><li> Toji's sister is mentioned at various points in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, and is important enough that she serves as the main reason he becomes a pilot. Despite this, she never actually appears in the series at all. She does however have a <em>very</em> brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoMustNotBeHeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoMustNotBeHeard">non-speaking cameo</a> in the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> movie. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She then becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> in the third movie, and is finally given an actual name ("Sakura").</span>
<ul><li> This is true of several other characters. For instance, Hikari mentions several times that she has two sisters, but we never see either of them... at least for a long time. They were first seen at the time of a promotional campaign regarding the opening of the 500 Type EVA train, as they were featured in merchandises, and, fittingly as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>, they are called Kodama and Nozomi, which along with Hikari are the names of the different speed categories of train used by the Tokaido Shinkansen. They later cameo in the kids' mecha anime <em>Shinkalion</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em>'s Lord Deadcross.
</li><li> The Dancing Giant ghost in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HauntedJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HauntedJunction">Haunted Junction</a></em> is only seen from the knee down, and generally only one leg at a time. He's that big.
</li><li> Ai Enma's "grandma" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em>. Although she talks, all we ever see of her form is her silhouette. The only human that takes a good look at her is completely horrified by what she saw.
</li><li> Partial example: Tsunade from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VainSorceress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VainSorceress">always makes herself look much younger than she is</a>, and on the couple of occasions where she was exhausted enough that the illusion fades we're prevented from getting a good look at her. What little we do see implies that she actually looks <em>older</em> than she really is, no doubt due to the life-shortening effect of her ultimate healing technique.
</li><li> In <em>Taro Kid</em>/<em>Skyers 5</em> (name varies depending on jurisdiction) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> (head of a SPECTRE-like criminal organization) is only ever seen from behind his chair.
</li><li> The Sacred Ancestor, the Vampire King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Dracula</a> remains unseen save for flashbacks where he receives no physical description save for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">eyes</a> in all mediums of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/VampireHunterD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/VampireHunterD">Vampire Hunter D</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArataTheLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArataTheLegend">Arata: The Legend</a></em>, the Hayagami in their humanoid forms.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou">The Pet Girl of Sakurasou</a></em>, Ryunosuke, resident in room 102 of Sakura Hall is one of these. Early on, his only interactions with the other characters are over the computer, either via chat room dialogue, or more commonly, a maid AI program that does the speaking for what he's thinking about. He finally appears onscreen in episode 9, and is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingCredits">visible in the credits.</a>
</li><li> Quite a few of the bigger players in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em> are never shown, including Medical Mechanica, Haruko's higher-ups, and Naota's older brother. (Even when there's a picture of him, his face is never shown.)
<ul><li> The Pirate King Atomsk is unseen until almost the very end. Even Amarao's earlier mental picture of him has his back to the audience <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Amarao is completely wrong about what he looks like anyway</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne">The Vision of Escaflowne</a></em> Hitomi occasionally referred to her younger brother, we never see him once at her home in the present day.
</li><li> The writer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">"Aerial Girls' Squad"</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako">Shirobako</a></em> only appears in the form of cryptic emails and his obnoxious editor, who always loudly insists that his client is too busy to see anyone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The director finally meets him in the second-to-last episode and, unsurprisingly, it turns out he wasn't really that busy, his editor was just getting in the way.</span>

<ul><li> Bob Newhart was famous for this. Many of his stand-up routines featured a "telephone" bit in which you only heard Bob's side of the conversation and had to imagine the other side. This gag made it into his TV shows a couple of times.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Bob</strong> (into phone, while drunk): Derr Bob Hartley. ... Derr. ... Dee, Ar, period.
</div></li><li> One who really defies categorization is the character of Vern from any of the late comedian Jim Varney's <em>Ernest</em> routines since the action was always told in first-person fashion from Vern's perspective, allowing the audience to essentially be that character.
<ul><li> Sometimes Vern's hands were seen, such as when Ernest got his hands caught in the window and asks for help, and the audience sees Vern's hands simply closing the blinds.
</li></ul></li><li> The late Joyce Grenfell used to do the same thing, with the audience taking the perspective of Shirley, or half the guests at a cocktail party (with Grenfell playing all the other half), or a nursery school.

<ul><li> Ben Grimm often speaks fondly of his dear Aunt Petunia, but for decades she was never seen. Finally, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> #239</em> featured her in person. It's revealed that she is a young woman married to Ben's Uncle Jake. Another couple decades later, she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedInTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedInTheFridge">Stuffed in the Fridge</a>.
</li><li> In the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> comics, Mary Jane was only referred to and never fully seen, although one story did featured a brief cameo we could only see her body and not her face. It would be over two years before readers received their first full glimpse of her in the comics, and Peter (and the audience) is shocked to find out she is actually a very attractive young woman.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">Before he was revealed to be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a>, any time the Green Goblin wasn't wearing his mask, his back was either turned to the reader or his face was almost completely shrouded in shadows.
</li><li> Likewise with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">The Hobgoblin</a> who trod a lot of familiar ground in his debut.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> was this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathOfTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathOfTheFamily">Death of the Family</a></em> for a large part because mostly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialHorror">he had no face</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JanJansEnDeKinderen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JanJansEnDeKinderen">Jan, Jans en de Kinderen</a></em>: Gijs, Jan's older brother, who is always mentioned, but never seen.

(In one ancestor story, the current Phantom had died and his son arrived at the Skull Cave to take up the role; he's shown completely, face and all, for several frames. Presumably the curse doesn't take full effect before he dons the suit for the first time, or the comic's readership may have taken a drastic drop in numbers...)

It's this that helps Sam figure out who the killer of both men was.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character in <em>Edward, My Son</em> is never seen onscreen. Everything we know about him we hear from other people.

This leads to a lot of very meaningful shots of his camel and his camel-goad.
</li><li> Technically, this tactic was used before in the 1959 Charlton Heston film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur">Ben-Hur</a></em>. Jesus cameos in the film, giving water to Judah Ben-Hur and, later, when Ben Hur witnesses the crucifixion. Not once is Jesus' face shown. Many Christians, especially Roman Catholics, are uncomfortable with <em>any</em> depictions of Jesus' face in contemporary or even classic media, as it puts a potentially misleading visual "face" on Jesus. The director of <em>Ben-Hur</em> decided not to show Jesus' face in the film out of respect for this.
<ul><li> The same tactic was used in the original silent version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur">Ben-Hur</a></em>.

That was so they could represent big companies in general rather than a single person, although the film adaptation shows them fully.
</li><li> Sauron of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. This, despite his being the novel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">Ultimate Evil</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonistTitle">The title is even a direct reference to him</a> (the Lord of the Rings).
<ul><li> Pippin, Aragorn, and Denethor see him face-to-face through the Palantír. Denethor explains Sauron's hidden nature as being due to the notion that all wise persons of power use <em>others</em> to do their fighting for them; however the story indicates that this is the act of dictators (like Sauron, Denethor, Saurman etc), while <em>good</em> rulers fight actually lead their underlings into battle (like Gandalf, Aragorn, and Théoden did).
<ul><li> Denethor isn't being cowardly, though. Before he goes insane from the use of Palantír he essentially tells that if everything is lost and Gondor falls, he will be spared so that Sauron can personally gloat and mock him, and <em>then</em> he will have a chance to strike personally, revealing that he's been living and even sleeping in a chain mail with sword on his belt to prepare for that moment. That is the reason he won't endanger himself in lesser battles. "Historically," Denethor is recorded by Tolkien as personally leading many defenses of Osgiliath, and every bit Boromir's equal in the pure badass department.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat undermined in the movies where the Eye of Sauron shows up plenty of times, such that the audience assumes (erroneously) that Sauron <em>is</em> the Eye.
<ul><li> In fact, in the books it's made pretty clear (though on few occasions, readers may miss it) that Sauron has a physical body (though he's still missing the finger Isildur cut off). Gollum was tortured by Sauron personally, and Aragorn's challenge for him to "come forth" at the Black Gate is meant literally - Aragorn wanted to personally fight Sauron, and so presumably knew or at least thought he had a body. In <em>The Silmarillion</em>, we're told that The Eye existed <em>before</em> Sauron lost his body.
</li><li> The third film originally had a scene where a ghost-like Sauron would have confronted Aragorn face to face. It was cut so as not to distract from the events taking place on Mount Doom.
</li><li> This trope is very briefly averted in the extended edition of the third film; when Aragorn confronted him, Sauron's corporeal, armored form can be seen holding his own palantir.
</li></ul></li><li> If you look at the events of the Silmarillion, Sauron's refusal to fight is well-founded. Every time he has involved himself personally, (against Beren and Lúthien; against the Númenóreans; against Isildur at the end of the Second Age) he has been defeated. Does this make him a coward, or just the result of his "being evil"? You decide.
<ul><li> It's implied that Sauron keeps himself secret even from his most high-ranking servants. Some have suggested that only the Mouth of Sauron (the only one of Sauron's servants allowed to refer to his master by name) ever actually talks to him.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TakeshiKovacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TakeshiKovacs">Takeshi Kovacs</a></em>: <em>Altered Carbon</em> includes the often-referenced but never-present Elias Ryker. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It emerges that the central character, Takeshi Kovacs, is inhabiting Ryker's body or "sleeve" while Ryker himself is "on stack", imprisoned in a digital environment.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> Mrs. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em>. Some fans theorize she doesn't exist, partly because some scenes really stretch the feasibility of it (she's nowhere to be seen at the policeman's ball despite Lt. Columbo asserting she'd be there), and partly because it ties into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">theories about</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">how Columbo</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">solves his cases</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> Captain Mainwaring's wife Elizabeth from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy">Dad's Army</a></em>, who is apparently much scarier than the Nazis. We get the briefest of glimpses in one episode where the two are lying in bunks, with the captain on the bottom. Above him in the top bunk is an extraordinarily massive indentation, suggesting a mountain of a woman.
</li><li> <em>Dan &amp; Becs</em> is absolutely <em>made</em> of this trope. Although the only characters to appear onscreen are the titular ones recording their video diaries, between them they reference dozens of characters. Just for starters: their respective parents, Becs's sister, their various respective friends, their various respective friends' siblings, Becs's agent, Dan's various exes, the various people they meet when looking for work... the list goes on. And that's not even starting on the real-life people who are unseen characters within the show.
</li><li> The banker on game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DealOrNoDeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DealOrNoDeal">Deal or No Deal</a></em>. His body can be seen from the booth, but there is no lighting on him, making him practically a shadow.
<ul><li> In the UK version, he is simply the voice on the other end of the telephone.
</li></ul></li><li> The '50s sitcom <em>December Bride</em> had as one of its supporting characters next-door neighbor Pete Porter (Harry Morgan), who often spoke of his unseen wife Gladys. Morgan was popular enough to get his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterShow">After Show</a> called <em>Pete and Gladys</em>...in which the latter <em>did</em> appear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The creatures inside the Daleks fitted this trope for the first few years of the show's run, with only the occasional (and often contradictory) hint as to their true nature. A hand was seen in the first story, a "time-destructed" octopus in the fourth, and so on. This added considerably to their menace.
<ul><li> Justified in that the Daleks have altered themselves many times, sometimes through natural evolution and sometimes by deliberate choice. Somewhat ironically for a species so dedicated to racial purity (and often leading to wars between "almost" identical sub-species).
</li><li> It got so extreme that even the creators of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runner</a> apparently forgot/didn't know that there was something inside and referred to them as a race of robots in one serial.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">Queen Elizabeth II</a> makes fairly frequent non-appearances. It's partly a running joke, partly because they likely don't want to have someone playing her onscreen and it obviously not being her. Hence why in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E3SilverNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E3SilverNemesis">"Silver Nemesis"</a>, she's played by a lookalike shot from far away. (They'd originally wanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishRoyalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishRoyalFamily">Prince Edward</a> to play himself, but he graciously declined.)
</li><li> The Silence played this role during Series 5, with their presence only being alluded to by the term "Silence Will Fall" or some variation of it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They are later revealed to be the ones responsible for blowing up the Doctor's TARDIS in the penultimate episode of Series 5, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E12ThePandoricaOpens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E12ThePandoricaOpens">"The Pandorica Opens"</a>.</span>

His voice is frequently heard over intercom, but he doesn't appear on-screen until the end of the first season (in which he's been fired).
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>:
<ul><li> Maris. The creators had initially planned to show her, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">descriptions of her</a> made her so monstrous that after a few seasons, they couldn't think of a way to show her without underselling the character.
</li><li> Also the source of a hilarious subplot involving Niles getting a pet whippet that everyone agrees is basically a canine Maris — this is basically the closest the audience ever gets to seeing the woman.
<ul><li> Except that we did see a heavily bandaged-up Maris in a flashback in one episode set in a hospital, but it was brief and she was almost entirely covered up. Another episode showed us her silhouette against a shower curtain.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">Queen Elizabeth II</a> does make one appearance in an episode, in a dream sequence where Daphne is horrified to see her on the balcony enjoying a barbecue with Marty. She is played by an unconvincing impersonator, mind you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> has "Ugly Naked Guy" who is blessedly always off-camera. The only time "Ugly Naked Guy" appeared on-screen, he was shot from the back (and thankfully above the waist).
</li><li> Kimmy Gibbler's parents from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> are regularly mentioned by Kimmy, but is never shown onscreen.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em>, Dorothy's crossdressing brother Phil is frequently mentioned and joked about but never seen. Rose's husband Charlie is the only former husband of the girls never seen; Sophia and Blanche's husbands are seen in flashback, and Dorothy's ex-husband Stan is a recurring character.
</li></ul><ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em>, the character of Jenny Piccalo was an offscreen "bad girl" friend of Joanie until the eighth season. Once brought onscreen, her character became much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>.
</li><li> Linderman of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> was this for much of the show's run, often referenced with characters seen speaking to him over the phone, or middle men conveying his orders. This makes sense as he's very much the shadowy manipulator but it was actually because the show couldn't afford to have a big star like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MalcolmMcDowell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MalcolmMcDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a> appear in too many episodes.
<ul><li> This makes it even more strange to see a kind, grandfatherly character as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, while we have been assured that "Mr. Linderman" is a truly ruthless, merciless villain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a> anyone?
<ul><li> Except that he really is an evil manipulator, so he's closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The physical incarnation of this particular trope is undoubtedly Wilson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em>. If it wasn't the fence hiding his mouth, it was a tree branch, a grill, other people, a Santa beard, or even a yam!
</li></ul><ul><li> If the titular mother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> does make appearances, we never see her face. In "Girls vs. Suits", Ted sees her ankle. In "No Pressure", only the back of her covered head is shown. In "No Tomorrow", the yellow umbrella is covering half of her body and she is wearing jeans.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Until the Season 8 Finale, when we finally get to see her face.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Kim's "best friend" Tina on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KathAndKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KathAndKim">Kath and Kim</a></em> never seems to spend any time with Kim at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances">Keeping Up Appearances</a></em>, Violet <em>was</em> this for the earlier series. She eventually made her full-time appearance as a character later in the run.
<ul><li> Sheridan was this for the whole series.
</li></ul></li><li> Angela Valentine was a girl in Beaver's class at Grant Avenue Elementary School in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Leave It to Beaver</a></em>. She was mentioned in no fewer than 16 episodes throughout the series' run. Usually concerning her sixth toe or getting sick in class, having a real gold filling, the eating of library paste, winning a tool chest at the local theater, suggesting (and then winning) a class beauty contest, losing her bite plate on the playground, bringing a "baked Alaskan" to the cake sale, getting her extra toe cut off, calling Beaver a "dirty, rotten, smelly old apple," having a birthday party, getting sick in the back of the school bus and wearing a Jackie Kennedy wig to school. (She is shown very briefly in 2 episodes but only from behind and later running or walking by. No one seems to know who played the part.)
<ul><li> Also, Larry Mondello's father.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLibrarians2007" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLibrarians2007">The Librarians (2007)</a></em>: Frances' daughter Bernadette.

Later progresses to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice">The Voice</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of the main things keeping viewers in suspense from the very first episode onwards was the true nature and appearance of the "monster", an enigmatic creature with terrifying distinct roars and the capacity to uproot trees and brutally mutilate. For a long time, the camera refuses to get a shot of the monster and we were kept in suspense of what it was. That is, until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we got a <em>very</em> brief glimpse of it in the first season finale, and we finally begin to get a clear shot of it in the second season</span>.
<ul><li> By the end of the series, this turns out to be Subverted: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we saw the Monster repeatedly throughout the first season, except we didn't know it was the Monster because we didn't yet know it had the ability to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation">Dead Person Impersonation</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> There's also the mysterious <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jacob. After frequently being mentioned and painted as a powerful figure in seasons 3-5 but never appearing, we had no idea who he was (and if he was even real at all), until the human form of the monster dropped a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> revealing the existence and appearance of Jacob.</span>

</li><li> Peggy's mother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>. She is implied to be <em>amazingly</em> obese, so perhaps the idea is that the camera couldn't have fit her in? The only thing visible about her is the vibrations in the house she causes when she moves.
</li><li> Lars Lindstrom, Phyllis' husband on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></em>.

</li><li> As noted, Carlton the doorman in the spin off, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rhoda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rhoda">Rhoda</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>: Sparky, the radio operator at I-Corps who Radar or Klinger often speaks with, pretty much fits this trope... although he did make a single, brief appearance in the season 1 episode "Tuttle".
<ul><li> The characters' loved ones back in the States, obviously...although some of them did "appear" via home movie, including Henry's wife Larraine, Frank's wife Louise, B.J.'s wife Peg, and Radar's mother (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyFamilyResemblance">Gary Burghoff in drag</a>).
</li><li> B.J.'s wife Peg appears again in the surreal episode "Dreams", in a depressing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence">Nightmare Sequence</a> that is meant to show how much he misses her and how he believes the war has pulled him away from her. Naturally, everyone else is suffering a case of this throughout this particular episode.
</li><li> In the "Run for the Money" episode, Charles gets a tape recording from his sister Honoria, so we get to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice">hear her voice</a> (which includes a bad stutter).
</li><li> Colonel Potter's wife in the states, Mildred, does not appear in the main series (save as a photograph on his desk), but is a regular character (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">two different actresses</a>) in the short-lived spin-off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AfterMASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AfterMASH">AfterMASH</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Arthur Daley's wife in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Minder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Minder">Minder</a></em>, fearfully referred to as "'Er Indoors."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting">Moonlighting</a></em> characters often referred to the "Ensalmo Case", which sort of combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a>: The case was only mentioned in passing. There were no characters named Ensalmo, nor did the case ever come to a close. It's revealed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> that it was never solved.
</li><li> Nils' mother Elna in the first season of Norwegian sitcom <em>Mot I Brøstet</em>, only referred to and heard through one-sided phone calls for the first 7 episodes. The sequel series <em>Karl&amp;Co</em> did the same with Ulf's wife Magda, who stayed unrevealed throughout the entire series.
</li><li> Adele, Sherrif Metzger's wife in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></em> is often mentioned but never seen.
</li><li> During several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MySoCalledLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MySoCalledLife">My So-Called Life</a></em>, Rayanne Graff mentions a friend named "Tino" who never made a physical appearance throughout the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunners">unfortunately short run</a>.
</li><li> Cambot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>, apart from his brief appearances in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTuneRollCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTuneRollCall">Robot Roll Call</a>. Justified in that everything on the Satellite of Love is seen through his lens.
</li><li> Until the last season Morty Fine, Fran's father, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em>.

<ul><li> Oscars girlfriend Crazy Rhoda Zimmerman was never seen.

</li><li> When the One Away game is played on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em>, Drew has the contestant plead to the "Mighty Sound Effects Lady" to see if they got X numbers right on the board.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRedGreenShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRedGreenShow">The Red Green Show</a></em>:
<ul><li> Red's wife Berince was never seen (except in a Christmas special near the series end).
</li><li> Dalton's wife Ann Marie also went unseen for most of the show, but was later upgraded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice">The Voice</a>.
</li><li> Actually, the show was full of these people. There were a number of lodge members who were alwayso talked about but never seen, mainly Moose Thompson and Old Man Segewick.
</li><li> For that matter there were often <em>entire episodes</em> in which unseen characters would have significant roles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRoyleFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRoyleFamily">The Royle Family</a></em>, which rarely leaves the confines of one house, creates a whole community of characters only ever described by the core cast. Chiefly; Jim and Barbara's neighbour 'Leggings' Lorraine, the housebound Elsie (who lives in the same flats as 'Nana' Norma and whose eventual death provides the background to an episode in the third series) and Dave's best friends Tony Macca and Gary. Most memorable though is Tony's supposedly tarty - and well-endowed - younger sister, Beverley.
<ul><li> Some characters are talked about in several episodes before we do eventually get a glimpse of them, including Anthony's best friend Darren and girlfriend Emma (plus her parents). Dave's parents were also regularly mentioned but didn't appear onscreen until the 2008 Christmas special. In addition, crucial aspects of Norma's character are introduced in the very first episode, when she makes a phone call to the Royle household, but it's not until later in the series that we see and hear her.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamsonEnGert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamsonEnGert">Samson En Gert</a></em>: This show has a lot of characters that are always talked about, but never seen: Bobientje, Marlèneke, Fred Kroket
</li><li> The extent to which Burnside is/is not willing to reconcile with his ex-wife Belinda in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSandbaggers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSandbaggers">The Sandbaggers</a></em> is a plot point in several episodes.

<ul><li> there was a character in the first season or two (later phased out) who drove around in a limo giving out orders/assignments. The name of the character was Blue Leader."
</li><li> Amanda's boyfriend during the 1st half of Season 1 is Dean. His face is never shown.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> had several, most notably George's Boss George Steinbrenner, whose face is never seen, Kramer's never-seen friends Bob Sacamano and Lomez, and Jerry's cousin Jeffrey, about whom Uncle Leo talks constantly.
<ul><li> George Steinbrenner was then real part owner and managing partner of the Yankees when George supposedly worked for the team. Steinbrenner was in the news a lot, and everyone knew what he looked like. Rather than try and get the real Steinbrenner to play himself, or find an actor who looked uncannily like him, whom audiences would accept, the producers chose to use someone who just looked like Steinbrenner from the back.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em>, Janice's estranged son Harpo is mentioned repeatedly over the course of the show, but never seen.

The others hear her having raging (but indistinct) rows with her mother, and at one point she storms downs the stairs played by the producer's sister in a wig, but neither they nor we ever meet her or see her face.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SportsNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SportsNight">Sports Night</a></em>, Luther Sachs was the owner of Continental Corp, which owned Continental Sports Channel, which broadcast the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a>.

Sam, who's almost always in the basement, talks to Elizabeth through the laundary chute, and sometimes she drops something down it on his head. The one time she actually comes down into the basement, the power is out and it's pitch black in the basement so we still can't see her. We also never see <em>or</em> hear Sam's parents, though sometimes one of the team is heard talking to them on the way down the basement stairs.

The character is always referred to as male, but no party is specified, nor is it clear if it's the same Prime Minister from one reference to the next.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, Mulder often made calls to someone at the FBI named "Danny", requesting warrants, paperwork, or other small but difficult-to-retrieve items they needed in the field. Sometimes Scully called Danny, and once John Dogget did as well. However, audiences never got to see Danny. The closest Chris Carter ever got to a character description was once during an interview when he joked that Danny was a gnome that lived in Mulder's desk.

However, since 2014, she has been doing all she can to subvert this, initially posting some pictures on Twitter and moving on to scattershot livestream appearances. Eventually, during the 2015 holiday streams, she appeared on the main channel to sing karaoke live with her girlfriend and hosted a stream that included both extended camera segments and a permanent facecam as a donation reward.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> we have Francine's older stepsister Gwen whom she would periodically mention and Stan would remark on how attractive she is, she never made an onscreen appearance until the season 11 episode "Now And Gwen".
</li><li> Fire Lord Ozai from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> isn't shown for the first two seasons. Most of the time he was a shadow behind a curtain or too far to be seen in details, or only his back or legs are shown. When he finally does show up, he appears as a surprisingly handsome man. Subsequent appearances are used to demonstrate that, appearances aside, he is as monstrous and evil as they come.
</li><li> Due to bizarre rights issues (as well as a desire to focus on lesser-known heroes), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> were barred from appearing in the first few seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em>. They were partially seen in one episode, but didn't make proper appearances until the final season. Superman was also usually alluded to via nicknames like "Big Blue" rather than his actual name.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a></em>' manager Brian Epstein is shown from the coat collar down at the beginning of the cartoon "Thank You Girl".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead">Beavis And Butthead</a>'s moms — they occasionally mention them and sometimes call to them but they are never seen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a></em>, Mr. Peanutbutter often leaves mid-conversation to speak to a never-seen entity only known as Erica. Also, on Tom Jumbo-Grumbo's show, whenever a bad joke is written in Jumbo-Grumbo's script, he blames it all on "Randy", who is also never seen. Some fan theories say that Erica and Randy are the same person.
</li><li> One of the stranger examples of this was in the episode "I Oughta Be in Toons" of the Disney series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers">Bonkers</a></em>, in which Mickey Mouse is the focal point of the plot (he is kidnapped by an impostor who attempts to sign a large contract with a rival studio) but is never actually shown on screen (except for a brief silhouette toward the beginning) or mentioned by name, only heard from inside the cage in which he had been locked.
<ul><li> Disney had a weird, unwritten policy in the '90s that actually putting Mickey Mouse in cartoons would somehow dilute his iconic marketability. The logic was that if anything he was in was ever regarded as <em>bad</em>, it might hurt the whole company, so it was better to never actually do anything with the character at all. A similar policy was instituted for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>. This weird policy was thankfully dropped in the 2000s, probably because people began to question just what the hell he actually did besides pose for merchandise.
</li></ul></li><li> Gazpacho in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder">Chowder</a></em> often talks about his mom, but she never appears in the series.
</li><li> XANA from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>. As an artificial intelligence, he solely exists as a program inside supercomputers. Hence he never takes a visible form, but his influence is certainly felt, symbolized by the ever-present "Eye of XANA" logo. There is one point where XANA <em>does</em> appear physically, but takes on Jérémie's appearance, and another episode where he appears in Franz Hopper's form. It's debatable that XANA also appears in the form of a black shadow with the logo on it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken">Cow and Chicken</a></em> parodied this one — the (human) parents of the title characters didn't exist above their waist. This was only shown twice: in the pilot, and in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel">I Am Weasel</a></em> (its spinoff), "Who Rubbed Out Cow and Chicken?" However, their shadows turned up too, and photos of them were of their upside-down legs.
<ul><li> One episode played with this; Chicken, rummaging through the closet, pulls out what appear to be the upper halves of a man and a woman, possibly their parents. After a stunned second, Cow says it's from an old school project.
</li></ul></li><li> The General on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines">Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines</a></em> was never seen but heard over Dastardly's telephone. He pays a visit to the squadron in "Stop Which Pigeon?" but we still only hear him as opposed to see him. Subverted in two comic book stories (Gold Key, Hanna-Barbera Fun-In issues 4 and 7) where he is clearly seen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em>, Principal Buttsavitch was mentioned but never shown. In the "Doug Graduates" (part of the last episode before Disney took over the show, not counting the Christmas special), Doug and Roger actively searched for him so that they could get some words of reassurance, since they were nervous about graduating, but they never actually found him. Also, Skunky Beaumont was a character who was often mentioned but never seen. He appeared in <em>Disney's Doug</em>, and he is portrayed as practically an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> of Jeff Spicoli from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastTimesAtRidgemontHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastTimesAtRidgemontHigh">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</a></em>.
</li><li> Eddy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em> often spoke highly of his brother, who never appeared <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">finale</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow">movie</a>.</span>
<ul><li> Also adults in general they sometimes mention their parents and talk to them but we never see them except in one episode where we see Ed and Eddy's parents' hands drag them away over bad report cards, in the episodes where they're in school the teachers and faculty are also unseen.
<ul><li> Adults do finally appear during a bus scene in the movie finale, but they are only seen from the waists down and none of them actually speak.

</li><li> In the cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>, there is a character that Gerald refers as "Fuzzy Slippers" and who knows a lot about urban legends, the local guys and how to contact a superheroine, but Fuzzy Slippers is never seen.
<ul><li> There is also the boarding house resident Mr. Smith we never see him aside from his silhouette and hand and when they eat together he has Arnold send him his food through a dumbwaiter, one episode has the residents try to break into his apartment so they can see him but Arnold convinces them to respect his privacy after they see he has a photo of the residents whom he considers his family.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Claw from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em> is never shown except in an over-the-shoulder shot of him sitting in a high-backed chair which obscures everything except his gloved right fist (although his left arm has also been shown in some episodes). This was played on in the opening, which had Gadget run in and handcuff him... only to reveal that he's really handcuffed a glove attached to a chair with a bomb in it.
<ul><li> In 1992, Tiger Toys released an action figure line based on <em>Inspector Gadget</em> (despite the fact that the show hasn't had new episodes made since 1986, it was still popular thanks to reruns on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>). One of the figures was one of Dr. Claw himself, making it the first time his face would be shown in any form. In fact, this revelation was such a huge selling point for the figure, that Tiger covered its face with a sticker on the blister pack, forcing kids to buy the toy if they wanted to see how Dr. Claw looked like. Once unpackaged, the figure revealed Dr. Claw to be an elderly-looking man with wild white hair, a goatee and an angry expression. The only other time this version of Dr. Claw would appear again was in the 1993 <em>Inspector Gadget</em> video game for the Super NES by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HudsonSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HudsonSoft">Hudson Soft</a>, where he appears as the game's final boss. Later revival movies and shows completely ignored this face reveal and kept portraying Dr. Claw as a faceless antagonist.
</li><li> Dr. Claw would also been shown in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InspectorGadget">1999 live-action movie</a>, where he is played by actor Rupert Everett. However, his potrayal of the character was a far-cry from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> depicted in the show, being more of a smooth-talking suave businessman. The movie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> sequel, <em>Inspector Gadget 2</em>, made him an unseen character once again in an attempt to portray the character more like his cartoon counterpart.
</li></ul></li><li> Wade from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> in person; broken in a late Season 3 episode.

In a time travel episode we see her whole body but she is bent over while talking to someone in a car so her face is obscured.
</li><li> Starswirl the Bearded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, at least initially. He had been mentioned numerous times, was responsible for creating spells which fueled the plot of several episodes, Twilight dressed up as him for Nightmare Night, and he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> of an earlier generation character, but nothing about his appearance or personality was known for a while (which spawned a fan theory that he eventually became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Discord</a>). It was later averted when he was extensively depicted in the comics and shown in a flashback in season four's two-parter finale <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E25TwilightsKingdomPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E25TwilightsKingdomPart1">Twilight's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E26TwilightsKingdomPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E26TwilightsKingdomPart2">Kingdom</a></em> (albeit stylized), in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E11ThreesACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E11ThreesACrowd">Three's a Crowd</a></em> (also stylized), and finally in season seven's two-parter finale <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E25ShadowPlayPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E25ShadowPlayPart1">Shadow</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E26ShadowPlayPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E26ShadowPlayPart2">Play</a></em> (this time in flesh and even interacting with the main cast, with a backstory behind his absence).
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> specials, adults were never seen (and only heard as "Mwah-wah" sounds, making them also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">The Unintelligible</a>), although on at least one occasion the unseen teacher's hand was shown giving a paper to Peppermint Patty.
<ul><li> A few specials and one of the movies showed adults. The Little Red-Haired Girl occasionally put in an appearance, under various designs.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nightmare Prince's mother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PotsworthAndCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PotsworthAndCompany">Potsworth &amp; Company</a></em>.
</li><li> The User in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em>.

This is averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ReBootTheGuardianCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ReBootTheGuardianCode">ReBoot: The Guardian Code</a></em> where the user is seen onscreen.
</li><li> Rocko's next-door neighbor/unattainable unrequited crush Melba Toast on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em>. We only see an arm here or a leg there, and she is never seen at all, only mentioned, after the first season (rather cleverly, the comic book played off of the lack of information about Melba in one issue by having her be a successful model... of products which only require the hand or foot to be displayed).
</li><li> In the first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>, Chuckie's mom was presumed to be alive, and would be referenced periodically. It wasn't until the Mother's Day episode that she was finally seen, and the revelation came that she was dead.
<ul><li> In earlier episodes Grandpa Lou would often refer to his younger brother "Sparky" whom he had a lot of crazy stories about including one where he supposedly sucked on a bottle for "15 years", we never saw him.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> had the main characters temporarily joining a nefarious cult. The actual cult leader, known only as "The Leader", never shows his face, traveling among his disciples in a limousine with tinted windows and making himself visible only by sticking his right arm out the window and waving to his disciples with a white-gloved hand in a nod to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh">Rajneesh<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. We don't get to see the inside of the limo until more than halfway through the episode, when the white-gloved hand suddenly grabs Homer and yanks him inside - and the person wearing the gloves turns out to be Marge, who had escaped from the cult's compound earlier in the story. While it's obvious that Marge managed to overthrow The Leader and take his place to help the rest of her family escape, it is never shown exactly how she did this. Yet, it's also subverted because we do see the cult leader's face on big billboards and in the final scene he escapes.
</li><li> An odd example occurred in the final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a> were mentioned, which was intended as a nod to the team's then-upcoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">TV debut</a>. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulDini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulDini">Paul Dini</a> was unaware of the fact that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> was NOT part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a>, and thus the crossover that was alluded to never took place.
</li><li> Most of the characters' parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> were like this; if they were shown at all, it was from the waist down. The notable exceptions were Hamton's parents (seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>), Elmyra's entire family, Calamity Coyote's dad, and Plucky's dad.
</li><li> In older MGM cartoons such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>, humans are only shown from the legs down, with an occasional shaken finger for emphasis.
<ul><li> However, In the uncensored version of Saturday Night Puss (the version that does not feature June Foray's character), Mammy Two-Shoes is finally seen in-full for a split second as she runs home to stop Tom's raucous party.

<ul><li> This trope applies equally to anyone considered a prophet in Islam — thus, movies about figures considered prophets like Jesus(Isa) or Moses(Musa) are often banned in Islamic countries. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Muhammad</a> is probably the most notable. Depictions of Muhammad (typically in Western media) have often led to threats of or actual violence by certain Muslim groups.

</li><li> The Albrecht brothers, Karl and Theo, formerly some of the richest people in the world (Karl even being in the top 10), were nearly a complete mystery to the public before their deaths. What is commonly known about them is that they took over their mother's convenience store and created a business empire with a discount store chain.
</li><li> John Swartzwelder has written more episodes of the Simpsons than anyone else but lives a notoriously reclusive lifestyle. He is the only main Simpsons writer to not appear on any DVD commentary and is rarely photographed or makes public appearances.
</li><li> Until the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the Japanese Emperor was this to a certain extent. For most common Japanese citizens, they had to avert their eyes when the Emperor passed by, and even the High Command gave their reports to the Emperor with him screened from view. This did not preclude his being filmed and photographed, however.
</li><li> During his time in prison, the South African apartheid regime prevented any photographs of Nelson Mandela from being taken. Right up until he was released in 1990, the most recent pictures of him anyone had seen were from 1964. Most people, having only seen images of a middle-aged man, didn't recognise the elderly man in his 70s walking out of prison.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JDSalinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JDSalinger">J. D. Salinger</a> lived outside the public view from 1965 until his death in 2010.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GretaGarbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GretaGarbo">Greta Garbo</a> also refused all interviews and media attention after she left the movie industry in the 1940s until her death in 1990.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPynchon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThomasPynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a> is another well known recluse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Banksy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Banksy">Banksy</a> was an example of someone whose face was never seen...<a class="urllink" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/banksy-identity_n_4179303">until a photograph of him turned up<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. A former collaborator, Joel Unangst, confirmed that it was him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents">The Residents</a>: The identities of the band members are secret. During performances they cover their faces in masks and grotesque make-up. In 2017, a year before dying, Hardy Fox revealed himself as the co-producer.
</li><li> Inverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Turkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Turkey">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</a>, where it is seen as illegal to hide or blur his image. To the point where Russian internet company, Yandex, and their version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google">Street View</a> had to go back and unblur all the accidental blurring of his face.
