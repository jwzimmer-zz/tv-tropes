<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a> The Second Raid</em>, Sousuke admits he can't focus anymore and abandons the mission, leaving Mao behind. He eventually does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">come back to save the day</a>.
<ul><li> Though even more interestingly, from the novel's short story "Golden Days with Captain Amigo," it's implied that Sousuke, given a choice, actually <em>would</em> hightail it out of Mithril and retire and go off somewhere to live where he can leisurely fish. The idea appealed to him greatly, and he was shown to get excited at the very thought of the possibility. It makes one wonder <em>how</em> different the series would be if he and Kurz managed to become filthy rich, and both decided to quit while they're ahead and retire.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em>, Maya Kitajima decided to give up on being a professional actress after the death of her mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the role Masumi Hayami had in keeping her whereabouts from her</span>. As she was still under contract with Daito Entertainment, she agreed to do one final performance for them. The role was a minor one, but the scene in question was pivotal to the play's story. The scene caused her to rediscover her passion for acting, but she had no means of working as a professional again and the scandal had blacklisted her name. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">Maya chose to find a different way back into the world of professional acting.</a>
</li><li> In the <em>Mazinger</em> saga:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: In episode seven several mobs had expressed their displeasure at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> stomping on their houses and them by harassing and assailing the heroes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor">Prof. Yumi</a> had been hurt when a mob had thrown stones at him, Sayaka was so upset at her father hurt and protesters yelling at the gates of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase">Home Base</a> she was thinking of quitting, and Kouji also decided just doing it after a big fight with her. Their retirement lasted until another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Mechanical Beast</a> attacked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>: From all possible times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> did this during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>. Tetsuya had grown so jealous of Kouji, falsely believing everyone were going to replace him with Kouji and forget about him (for all his bluster, he <em>has</em> issues). Saying that his attitude came back to bite him was quite the understatement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Duke</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Fleed</a> was doing this at the beginning of the series.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Beyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Beyblade">Beyblade</a></em>, Kai takes a 10-Minute Retirement at the beginning of season two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, Amuro quits being a pilot for about two days after his superiors discuss forcing him to retire. Just to show them, he takes the Gundam with him and buries it in the desert until they need him again.
</li><li> Happens twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em>. First, Garrod tries to <em>sell</em> the Gundam after he's responsible for injuring a crewmate and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> (thanks to his inexperience in being part of an actual crew). He gets back in when his new friends are in danger. Later, Roybea quits the <em>Freeden</em> because they're taking sides in a war, which he disapproves of, but he ends up falling for a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the local resistance</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and she's shot dead in front of him</span>. He comes back in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> and has to be talked down from attacking the entire Federation army.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, Wufei goes through a phase in which he feels unfit to pilot his Gundam after Treize swiftly defeated him in a sword fight.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun">Trigun</a></em>, Vash the Stampede runs off after losing control of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> in the episode "Fifth Moon". Several months later (the next episode, "Goodbye For Now"), Wolfwood finds him hiding under an assumed name and talks him back into his old life.
<ul><li> And then he does it again after (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legato forces Vash to kill him</span>) in "Sin."
<ul><li> Yet the BSOD is somewhat justified, as he's been living by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> pledge <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for over 100 years</span>. The sudden return to action is more of a jolt, honestly.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> Edward Elric is fairly broken up about what happened to Nina, but doesn't resign.
</li><li> He does have what amounts to a ten <em>second</em> retirement later on though. He turns in his pocket watch (the token of all state alchemists) to King Bradley, and then gives a long speech about how he won't work for the corrupt higher ups any longer or take part in their evil schemes. Bradley counters this speech by threatening his childhood friend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>, Winry, and Ed angrily takes the watch back and continues working.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a>, Ed once briefly resigned his position as a state alchemist. He went back not long afterwards, but the 10-Minute Retirement probably saved his life; he ran into Scar, a serial killer targeting state alchemists, and Scar would have killed him if Edward hadn't said he had retired.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear">Prétear</a></em>, Mannen announces that he is going to quit being a Leafe Knight after his actions led to the escape of the monster they were trying to kill. The problem is — the Knights are all born to protect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Leafe</a>, all have different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">powers</a>, so there are no replacements.

This trope is almost cliché in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a>.

<ul><li> One of the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches">Gimmick Matches</a> is the "Retirement Match," where the loser has to retire from wrestling. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a> in the run-up to a Retirement Match he had coming up - "Most wrestlers who lose retirement matches return six weeks later. I'm not going to do that." Foley lost the match (to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>), but was then invited back for a match at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a>. When he came back, he lampshaded again: "I said I wouldn't come back in six weeks, and I told the truth. I came back in four." Though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> match was his last one for a good long while. He waited four years before he got back in the ring and even then, only semi-regularly.
</li><li> In reality, this trope has been beaten to death in the wrestling business. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk">Terry Funk</a>, for example, has retired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsAreOffTheScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsAreOffTheScale">many</a> times.

</li><li> A similar angle is when a wrestler is "fired" only for them to come back in no time at all, usually never even leaving TV.

<ul><li> Teased at this in 1990 during his feud with Earthquake. To allow legit injuries to heal and to tend to movie-making projects, Hogan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyHart">Jimmy Hart</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnTenta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnTenta">John Tenta</a> (Earthquake) conceived an angle where Earthquake would sneak attack Hogan during an interview with Brother Love, causing serious injuries to his chest. The trope kicked in when Hogan was distraught over being caught off-guard by a man that had been threatening to kill him off, and that coupled with an earlier loss to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a> at Wrestlemania VI were enough for him to retire. The WWF's announcers pleaded for fans to send letters and cards requesting his return and to "heal" his fighting spirit, the response was (predictably) strong ... and by the start of August, Hogan had come out of his self-imposed "retirement" to gain revenge on Earthquake.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> played with this trope in a stroke of genius when Hogan pleaded retirement in a last ditch attempt to dodge facing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a> at <em>Bound for Glory</em> and putting his control of the company on the line. Sting, being clever now and knowing Hogan as well as he does, had a look at surveillance cameras and was able to get footage of Hogan and Bischoff laughing at the fans for actually buying into it. This finally broke Hogan off the deep end to the point he agreed to all of Sting's conditions right then and there.

</li><li> Ayako Hamada retired from pro wrestling in May of 2018 only to return in July of 2019. This case was justified, by the confines of this trope, as her retirement had been enforced after she was arrested in Tokyo for hallucinating while under the affects of snorted kakuseizei and sentenced to three years of probation.

Smith as a "part-timer" for unretiring in the middle of the season.
<ul><li> Favre pulled the same stunt during his last four off-seasons with the Packers. But because no "official" announcement was ever made by Favre himself, it didn't get nearly as much coverage outside of Wisconsin. This was partially due to the assumption that the writers who reported his retirement were just opportunistic local guys trying to get some cheap publicity... but also because jerking the Packers organization and his loyal fans around was thought to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace">well beneath a man of Brett Favre's character</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a>, indeed!

He quickly announces his own retirement, immediately followed by another announcement about his return.
</li><li> Jay Cutler's retirement after not being resigned by the Bears after the 2016 season was a more justifiable example than Favre. Cutler even had a commentating job lined up, but Miami's Ryan Tannehill went down for the year with an injury, so Cutler came out of retirement to work with head coach Adam Gase, who was Cutler's offensive coordinator for several years in Chicago.

After managing WWII and its aftermath (you may have heard of the Marshall Plan) from behind the scenes he tried to retire to his garden when the war ended. He was pulled out of retirement after <strong>one</strong> day to become ambassador to China.

As he put it to <em>Life</em> magazine in '92, he was tired of "being expected, or required, to do hit songs that I no longer can do with any integrity or credibility." This stuck longer than most: all the songs stayed retired until 1996, whereupon ""Heroes"" appeared as part of the Outside Summer Festivals Tour and set the stage for most of the rest to return to his repertoire. (In the interim he stuck with new material, both with Tin Machine and as a solo performer, and less-popular older songs that fit in with the new stuff thematically and/or musically.)
<ul><li> An unintentional example, perhaps a subversion, occurred in 1973, when he announced he had done "the last show well ever do." A lot of fans thought he was retiring, but what he actually meant was that he was retiring the Ziggy Stardust character.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belgium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belgium">Belgian</a> parliament passed a law legalizing abortion in early 1990. The King of the Belgians, Baudoin, had to sign it before it took effect. There was just one problem: the King was a devout Catholic, and any Catholic who facilitates even <em>one</em> abortion is automatically excommunicated. Legalizing the procedure for an entire <em>nation</em> is... frowned upon. On the other hand, Belgium was a constitutional monarchy where the Royal Assent had long become a formality, and the King attempting to unilaterally veto a law was... <em>even more</em> frowned upon. The King got around this dilemma by reaching an agreement with Prime Minister Wilfried Martens and <em>abdicating for a day</em>: he was declared temporarily unable to serve on 4 April, Martens' government as a whole took over as head of state and the cabinet members all signed the law, before Parliament declared him competent to serve again the next day. (Some uncharitable people would have you believe the whole procedure was emblematic of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Belgian federal politics</a>.)

</li><li> Jesse Jackson announced his withdrawal from activism in 2001, after it became known that he'd had an affair and fathered an illegitimate daughter. Shortly afterwards, he announced that he was returning. Pundit Jonah Goldberg quipped, "One man's 'retirement from public life' is another man's 'long weekend'."
</li><li> Paul Scholes retired from all football in May 2011 and almost immediately regretted it, returning seven months later and promptly being talked about for international contention again (he retired from international football in 2004 and was pretty much constantly badgered to change his mind until retiring from all play in 2013).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> announced his "retirement" from the road in a 1977 concert after a period of burnout. He returned to the road with a piano/percussion lineup with Ray Cooper in 1979, famously touring in Russia (he was the first Western act allowed to perform in Russia at the height of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>). He's since made empty threats to "retire" from recording and/or touring throughout his career, to the point a roadie reportedly made a mixtape of all of his "retirement" announcements (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">which made Elton laugh</a>).

Upon returning to acting, however, his luck was running out. He eked along from 1965 to 1980 taking whatever work he could get (like dinner theater), but in the end, he found it so embarrassing that he decided to throw in the towel and move on. Thing is, he announced his retirement in a goodbye ad in <em>Variety</em> - which got him noticed by casting directors. In the face of renewed offers for movies and television (including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">particularly successful one involving a future Star Trek captain and time travel</a>), he gladly went back to acting almost immediately after 'retiring'.

</li><li> Alan F. Horn was the head of Warner Bros. Entertainment from 1999-2011, and he was most famous for overseeing mega projects like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">Lord of the Rings</a></em> series, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> films, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em>. He was forced out of the company in 2011 by the Time Warner bosses and announced that he was "done" with Hollywood... but then a year later was named the head of the Walt Disney Studios, where he's overseeing mega projects like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> sequel trilogy, and the revived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a>.

However, despite his doctors' fears, he ultimately recovered and recorded <em>The System Has Failed</em> with a radically different lineup; it was originally intended to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloSideProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloSideProject">solo album</a> but the record label <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">demanded it released under the Megadeth moniker</a>. Dave and his revolving door of musicians have been releasing subsequent Megadeth albums ever since.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory">Fear Factory</a>'s "official" 2003 breakup was cut alarmingly short by a reformation with bassist Christian Olde Wolbers replacing former guitarist Dino Cazares and the release of <em>Archetype</em> in early 2004.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ">Jay-Z</a> is notorious for claiming he's going to "retire" and then not doing so, often making more music a very short time later. His first time "retiring" was back in 1996 after his first album debuted. He's had 10 albums since then, not counting collaborations and guest appearances.
</li><li> Mark Martin has become the epitome of this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a>. In 2004, he announced that 2005 would be his last year on the Sprint Cup tour. In the seven years that have passed since this first deadline, he's never raced fewer than 24 of the 36 races in a given season, and has actually raced more full-time seasons (four) than part-time (three). Initially, Mark had to extend his retirement tour into 2006 after his planned replacement in the 6 car, Carl Edwards, was called onto the Sprint Cup tour shortly after Martin's original announcement as an emergency replacement for just-released Jeff Burton, with his performance in the 99 leading to a full-time ride in that car for 2005 through to the present. Martin departed Roush Racing after 2006, when it was decided David Ragan was ready to take over the 6, but rather than fully retire, he moved to Ginn Racing, splitting time in the 01 with Regan Smith. When Ginn folded into DEI later that year, Martin moved there as well, and took over the 8 car in 2008, splitting time with Aric Almirola. Then, Hendrick Motorsports convinced Martin to take over the 5 car full time in 2009. Martin ended up having a very strong year in '09, winning five times and finishing runner-up to new teammate Jimmie Johnson, which led to Hendrick re-signing him for 2010 and '11 as well. 2012 saw Martin leave Hendrick, but once again, he only semi-retired, signing a two-year, 48 race deal with Michael Waltrip Racing and the 55 car. He signed with Stewart-Haas Racing in 2013, and raced as a substitute for the injured Tony Stewart that year. It ended up being his final year racing. While he was still under contract in 2014, and almost filled in for Stewart once again, he's now finally retired for good a decade after first announcing it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> announced in 1993 that he'd retire from touring and called his would-be final tour "No More Tours" (a play on his song "No More Tears"). He was back on the road in 1995 with "The Retirement Sucks Tour" and has been on the road more or less ever since.
<ul><li> Averted in 2018, when he announced that he would no longer be touring. He stressed that this was not a retirement, he'd still do shows here and there, he just wouldn't be going on a full tour anymore. And considering he's 69 as of 2018, who can blame him?
</li></ul></li><li> First Minister of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthernIreland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthernIreland">Northern Ireland</a> Peter Robinson pledged to step down in early 2010 after it came out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrsRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrsRobinson">his wife had been fooling about with a 19-year-old</a> and then taken out loans for the boy without reporting it to the proper authorities—and that Mr Robinson, the First Minister, knew about it. A few weeks thereafter, an official made it clear that even if wrongdoing was found he'd get no more than a reprimand, and he returned to his post.
</li><li> Longtime ABC college football announcer Keith Jackson retired in 1999, then was persuaded to return to the booth the following year. He retired again in 2006, and this time it stuck; he died in 2018 without ever returning to broadcasting.
</li><li> New York Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens announced his retirement in 2003, then came back the following year with the Houston Astros, ostensibly for "just one season". He stayed with in Houston through 2006, re-announced his retirement, then came back with the Yankees midway through the 2007 season. He retired yet again at the end of that year, this time for good. (At least, until 2012, when at the age of 50 he signed with an independent minor-league team in Sugar Land, Texas.)
<ul><li> Andy Pettitte retired in 2010, unretired in 2012, and re-retired in 2013.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">Tennis</a> player Martina Hingis retired and unretired multiple times over the course of her career due to being plagued by injuries (and accusations of drug-taking later on). Justine Henin also infamously retired out of the blue in 2008 (in spite of still being ranked No. 1 at that time), only to unretire a year later after Kim Clijsters made her own successful unretirement. She then retired for good two years later after being hindered by injuries.
</li><li> Trent Reznor disbanded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a> in 2009 after a farewell tour and a string of "final shows." He spent only a couple of years working on soundtracks and side projects before putting out a new NIN album in 2013. By contrast, there were five years between NIN's first and second albums, five more between their second and third and six years between their third and fourth.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Orbital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Orbital">Orbital</a> brothers went solo in 2004 after <em>The Blue Album</em> and a subsequent farewell tour, but reformed for a 20th anniversary reunion tour in 2009, followed by the release of <em>Don't Stop Me/The Gun is Good</em> in 2010 and <em>Wonky</em> in 2012. They split again in 2014, with Paul releasing a solo album under the name 8:58 the following year, only to reunite a second time in 2017 and release <em>Monsters Exist</em> in 2018.
</li><li> Adult film stars do this all the time.
</li><li> Andrew Sega and Reagan Jones put their synthpop act <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Iris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Iris">Iris</a> on indefinite hold after a falling-out following the supporting tour for 2010's <em>Blacklight</em>, but their spark was reignited in 2013 after Jones sent three song sketches to Sega, leading to the production of <em>Radiant</em>, released in Fall 2014.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder">New Order</a> disbanded in 2009, with Bernard Sumner saying that he no longer wished to make music under the name. Just two years later, however, Sumner reformed the group, with keyboardist Gillian Gilbert returning after a ten-year hiatus, and bassist Tom Chapman, from the side project Bad Lieutenant, replacing Peter Hook, who left in 2007.
</li><li> Sascha K. disbanded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KMFDM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KMFDM">KMFDM</a> in 1999 after the release of <em>Adios</em>, due to irreconcilable differences with Gunter Schulz and En Esch, and founded the side project MDFMK with Tim Skold and Lucia Cifarelli. After switching labels to Metropolis Records due to a disagreement with Universal, Sascha reformed KMFDM in 2002 with Skold, Cifarelli, Raymond Watts, and Bill Rieflin.
</li><li> By the mid-90s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardNimoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardNimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> kept saying he was going to retire, yet he kept coming back, most notably for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em>, until he passed away in 2015.
</li><li> Similar to Hideo Kojima, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a> has stated that ever <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> game after the original was made on the assumption that he would never make another one afterwards, and he has also voiced his displeasure with the "sequel process" of the industry and that it was his main motivation of leaving HAL Laboratory to form his own company. Of course, he has returned to the series twice over even with Sora Ltd., though he also states thinks <em>Smash 4</em> will be his final <em>Smash</em> game "for real".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieLeeCurtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a> has hinted at or even announced her retirement a few times, but continues to act in film and television. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChristmasWithTheKranks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChristmasWithTheKranks">Christmas with the Kranks</a></em> in 2004 was supposed to be her final film, but while she took a bit of a break, she came back with a supporting role in 2007 with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeverlyHillsChihuahua" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeverlyHillsChihuahua">Beverly Hills Chihuahua</a></em>, and has since had roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouAgain">You Again</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>, recurring roles on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewGirl">New Girl</a></em>, and also dabbled in voice acting with a role in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FromUpOnPoppyHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FromUpOnPoppyHill">From Up on Poppy Hill</a></em>. She's now playing a lead in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanMurphy">Ryan Murphy</a>'s slasher series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamQueens2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamQueens2015">Scream Queens (2015)</a></em>, which she has also suggested might be her final role. Given her past history, it's unlikely this will be the case.
<ul><li> She's also "retired" from horror and slasher films more than once. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII1981"> Halloween II (1981)</a></em> was supposed to be her last hurrah as a scream queen, but she returned in 1998 for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenH20TwentyYearsLater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenH20TwentyYearsLater">Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later</a></em> as a gift to the fans. She also appeared in 2002's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenResurrection">Halloween: Resurrection</a></em> under contractual obligations. She then distanced herself from horror once again until 2015, appearing as the lead in the slasher series <em>Scream Queens</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1983, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell">Soft Cell</a> frontman Marc Almond announced that he was quitting the music industry following an altercation between himself and a music journalist who had given a less than complimentary review to an album which Marc recorded as part of a side project. However, the announcement was retracted shortly after and, though Soft Cell disbanded the following year, Marc continued recording as a solo artist.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> attempted this in 1962 when the former Vice-President (who had just lost the race for Governor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California">California</a> to incumbent Governor Pat Brown<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6nuka');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6nuka" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6nuka');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(father of later California governor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JerryBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JerryBrown">Jerry Brown</a>)</span> two years after narrowly losing the Presidency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>) announced that "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%27s_November_1962_press_conference">you don't have Nixon to kick around any more, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>." Nixon didn't stay retired long, briefly floating his name as a compromise candidate for the Republican nomination for President in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroubledProduction/Other" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroubledProduction/Other">highly contentious</a> 1964 campaign before running for (and winning) the Presidency in 1968 to complete his political comeback.
</li><li> Swimming superstar Michael Phelps insisted in multiple interviews that the 2012 London Olympic Games would definitely be his last competition. It didn't stick, of course.
</li><li> In the wake of Argentina's defeat in the final of the 2016 Copa América Centenario<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7jvw0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7jvw0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7jvw0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a special one-off tournament organized jointly between the North American and South American association football confederations to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first Pan-American soccer tournament</span>the third major international final the <em>Albiceleste</em> had lost in three years (the others being the 2014 World Cup and 2015 Copa América)superstar Lionel Messi announced his retirement from international football. It didn't even last two months.
</li><li> In the same sport, US star Landon Donovan announced his retirement in 2014, returning in 2016 to help his former team, the LA Galaxy, through a late-season injury crisis. After that season, he announced his retirement again. That retirement didn't stick either, as he came back in 2018 to play for Mexican top-flight side León. After a few months, he was let go, and then played indoor soccer back in the States before retiring again in 2019, this time apparently for good. (He now owns and coaches a team in the US second level, the USL Championship.)
</li><li> This is common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EquestrianSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EquestrianSports">equestrian sport</a>, where riders are often physically able to compete into their 40s and 50s, so careers can be long and incorporate several breaks due to injury or other circumstances. As of 2019, legendary New Zealand eventer Sir Mark Todd was trying to retire again aged 63, but even 'retirement' for him means training a string of racehorses.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SimonBolivar">Simón Bolívar</a> had this both in the "forced to do it" and "really I want to retire, leave me alone" variety. His first couple of attempts to win independence for Norther South America (Colombia, Venezuela and so on) almost all started out promising enough only for the Spanish to come back with a vengeance and Bolivar escaping by the skin of his teeth into exile. Bolivar would then sit a round in exile as a "private citizen" and plot the next attempt. After he finally managed to make independence stick, he originally intended to pull a Cincinnatus and retire to his farm (freeing all his slaves in the process, mind you), but it was not to be - armies would always end up under his command and he would be appointed to more presidencies than he could resign from. Critics of course said this was all a deliberate ploy to be given absolute power (like Octavian/Augustus had done nearly two thousand years earlier), but Bolivar did not attempt to resign once or twice, but too often to count. It never stuck.
</li><li> At the end of the 2016 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> season, Brazilian driver Felipe Massa announced his retirement. However, Valtteri Bottas moved to Mercedes that year, leaving a seat open at Williams. Massa came back for one more season in 2017. After a short break in 2018, it was announced that he would race again in Formula E series for 3 years (possibly) before retiring for good.
</li><li> In 2015, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman">David Letterman</a> retired from hosting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateShow">The Late Show</a></em> after more than 30 years in television. But, in 2018, he started hosting a brand new talk show, <em>My Next Guest Needs No Introduction...</em> on Netflix.
</li><li> Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby, in her final tour (which was recorded for Netflix), announced that she was going to quit stand-up comedy due to the anger she was feeling in her daily life not translating well to the career. However, <em>because</em> of the anger and how she portrays it in the special, people responded positively to her message, which inspired her to continue her career because her message was resonating so well.
