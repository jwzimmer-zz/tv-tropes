</p><p>Evil winning includes: the universe becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring">boring</a>, society tearing itself apart because it's made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> creatures, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">The Heartless</a> have nothing left to feed on, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseWow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseWow">Apocalypse Wow</a>.
</p><p>If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact">Villains Act, Heroes React</a> is in place, Good may be portrayed as being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsImpotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsImpotent">intrinsically weaker</a></em> than the "unbalancing" forces of Evil, with counteraction to maintain Balance being the best outcome it can hope for. Another case is that the force of Evil is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> and <em>wants</em> to destroy the balance for that reason, but even then the trope may still be played straight by the force of Evil destroying both good <em>and</em> evil entirely, and thus forming a balance of zero.

Occasionally, this is used as justification as to why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> needs to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">sealed away instead of killed</a>, because killing him would create an inbalance resulting in a stronger evil stepping up to fill the void. By sealing away the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, they neutralize his threat (he can't cause death and destruction anymore) but he's still technically in the world (just imprisoned), so balance is maintained.
</p><p>Sometimes, this refers directly to the heroes and villains in the story, instead of Good and Evil as a whole. In this case, the villain doesn't need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsOutShopping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsOutShopping">be DOING evil at the time</a>, they're just evil, so good must balance them out. Likewise, the hero doesn't have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">perform acts of heroism all the time</a>; just being good provides balance for the villain's evil.

</p><p>There are several challenges to writing this trope believably. To start, it depends on how "Good", "Evil" and "Balance" are defined and recognized; for a clear example, let's look at sexual assault. Let's say a person has sex with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButLiquorIsQuicker">someone via intoxication</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualExtortion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualExtortion">Sexual Extortion</a> — if their society does not recognize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent">Questionable Consent</a> as a thing, let alone view it as "Evil", does it still need to be balanced? And how would you even recognize such a "Balance" and where does it draw the line? Even stepping further into more violent forms, does preserving the Balance mean that you have to, say, defend a violent, murderous rapist's right to murder and rape just a little bit, but not too much? In those cases, "Good" and "Evil" become something more similar to physical forces like "Hot" and "Cold" and don't have anything to do with morality at all. Such a balance also contrasts with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfUnavoidableVersusUnforgivable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfUnavoidableVersusUnforgivable">Sliding Scale of Unavoidable vs. Unforgivable</a>, which argues that there are some evils which cannot be tolerated. If all evil is necessary to maintain balance, then it by definition <em>must</em> be tolerated. If the world is at peace, then does that disadvantage the Evil side, and if Good and Evil are at war, then does that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">disadvantage the Good side</a>? Does a thousand years of peace need to be balanced by a thousand years of chaos and destruction? What if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOnlyHasToWinOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOnlyHasToWinOnce">said destruction (or any evil act) cannot be undone</a>?
</p><p>You can substitute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightDarknessJuxtaposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightDarknessJuxtaposition">Light and Darkness</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavenVersusHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavenVersusHell">Heaven and Hell</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">Order and Chaos</a>, or any Yin and Yang for Good and Evil with the added bonus of making more sense linguistically—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothOrderAndChaosAreDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothOrderAndChaosAreDangerous">a balance between Order and Chaos is better than either extreme</a>, not to mention the horrors that happen with too much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire">Light</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoForgotTheLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoForgotTheLights">Darkness</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Souls in the physical world and the spirit world need to balance out by being recycled. When people die in the physical world, their souls move to the Soul Society and vice versa. If a person becomes a Hollow they are trapped in their state, unable to move on until purified back into the cycle by a Shinigami's Zanpakutou. Only Quincies are capable of truly destroying a soul because the removal of a soul from existence destroys the balance of souls between worlds. As a result, the Shinigami tried to exterminate the Quincies to save the world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the Quincies stage a revenge extermination on the Shinigami, their first act is to kill so many Hollows that the Shinigami are forced kill 28,000 souls in Soul Society, which forces those souls to reincarnate in the World of the Living to create a new balance between the physical and spiritual worlds.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> runs on this heavily.

She made four worlds, each ruled and balanced by one Shinzoku ("godly race") lord and one Mazoku ("evil race") lord. Each group has its own set of generals and henchmen.

Thus far she's been unsuccessful, and given the nature of the series it'll probably remain that way. It's later revealed that what Hild does care about is the balance and the reason she antagonizes the goddesses is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their presence in the Morisato home causes an imbalance that she needs to rectify</span>.

Every wish made with the Dragon Balls produces an energy that is counter to the nature of the wish, i.e. good-natured wishes produce negative energy and vice versa. This energy was meant to dissipate between each use of the Dragon Balls, but due to the frequency of their use, there wasn't enough time for that to happen. This eventually led to the creation of seven dragons, born from the built-up energy. Because the majority of wishes were made by the heroes, the dragons were born from negative energy and therefore were evil, though one did have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> tendencies from the few wishes made by the villains.

The Red Lanterns, Orange Lanterns and Yellow Lanterns (who wield the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">anger</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">greed</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalFear">fear</a>, respectively) can all definitely be considered "evil", while the Blue Lanterns, the Indigo Tribe and the Star Sapphires (who wield the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpringsEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpringsEternal">hope</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">compassion</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">love</a>, respectively) can all be considered "good". But it's also pointless to try to wipe out the "evil" Lanterns, since they simply channel emotions exuded by living beings—which will <em>always</em> exist, regardless of how many Lanterns are defeated. And regardless of their noble intentions, the "good" Lanterns are also ineffectual in many ways: the Blue Lanterns lack the willpower to affect change, the Indigo Tribesmen are emotionally distant recluses, and the Star Sapphires lack the self-control necessary to act with clear judgment. That's why the titular Green Lanterns are so important: they lie at the center of the spectrum, and their central emotion (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">willpower</a>) simply gives them the courage and fortitude to fight for what's right. The green light of willpower is the only force in the universe that can give its users great power without clouding their sense of morality.

</li><li> A number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffytheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffytheVampireSlayer">Buffy</a></em> fics have pointed out that while the higher powers of evil in the BTVS world (i.e. Wolfram &amp; Hart and the Old Ones) are obsessed with creating an apocalypse and destroying/conquering everything the so-called forces of "good", like the Powers That Be, seemed to be more interested in maintaining a balance between the two, to the point of opposing their own champions if they are doing too good a job destroying evil. A common theme among such fics is that if either side wins, the Powers That Be lose either their power or their influence over the mortal world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/QueenOfAllOni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/QueenOfAllOni">Queen of All Oni</a></em>: In the old days, the forces of Light and Darkness, with Good and Evil attaching to them, fought constantly, with evil always being able to bounce back quickly from a defeat or death. To stop this, the Eight Immortals set in motion the Grand Design, a manipulation of causality that ensured that champions of good would always arise to defeat evil, and that defeated evils would stayed sealed and out of the game. All this was designed to hinge on the reincarnation cycle of the Ben Shui order's Chosen One, who existed to maintain the various seals and the balance as a whole. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, since someone murdered the last potential Chosen One before they could take the role, and Jade (the current potential Chosen One) having fallen to darkness for so long, the Design as a whole is decaying, apparently beyond any hope of repair.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheUltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheUltimateEvil">The Ultimate Evil</a></em>: In addition to the established examples of this trope shown in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">canon</a> (like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality">Tiger Talisman</a> and the world's balance), there is a new form of balance included: the concept of an "Other" (an abbreviation to "Other half of one's self").

The more information they give the new generation of Bearers, the more they also have to share with the villain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CodexEquus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CodexEquus">Codex Equus</a></em>, it is implied in lore that a balance between good and evil exists in Equus, and there are certain deities who are born to maintain that balance. Letting one side overpower the other tends to create disaster - too much Good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveBecomeComplacent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveBecomeComplacent">would cause Equus to stagnate</a> and become utterly unprepared to face future Evils, while too much Evil would essentially result in the destruction of everything, including itself.
<ul><li> The twin Deer gods, Belyolen and Temnobog, are living embodiments of this trope. They were supposed to be born as one person, but because Irminsul tried enforcing his twisted ideas of perfection by magically purging his then-unborn son of his darker flaws, he ended up with twin sons instead. Despite the other gods believing that Belyolen's natural compassion and radiance made him "superior" to the dark Temnobog, they're actually equals who embody Light and Dark, Good and Evil, respectively. They both share a unique elemental bond that causes power imbalances whenever one of them tries to gain an advantage, so they couldn't kill each other. They only get stronger when they work together because that is the brothers' purpose - to bring Balance to Deerkind. While Belyolen blesses his worshipers and protects them from evil, Temnobog works as the Bogolenya pantheon's chief punisher, using evil to test mortals and tormenting the souls of wicked people.
</li><li> As it turned out, the overabundance of Good within the Elternteil pantheon was what caused it to splinter into the Bogolenya and the Hoyklan pantheons, because there were no "Evil" deities to keep it in check. The only evil god among them at the time, Temnobog, was emotionally abused because his family and peers believed that his mere presence would "taint" their benevolence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">which caused Temnobog to genuinely become evil</a>. This ultimately caused the compassionate Belyolen to rebel, calling everyone out on their blatant hypocrisy and complacent arrogance out of disgust and leaving home to form his own pantheon, so he could protect Temnobog and give him the love and respect he believed his brother deserved.
</li><li> This trope is also the reason why King Strazha and his younger biological sister, Queen Vesna, were blessed by Temnobog and Belyolen, respectively - both Deer gods were impressed with their actions, and made the young rulers their divine champions to ensure that their kingdom, Bitaniya, prospers under the Balance of Good and Evil. While Strazha is the feared "Hoof" of Bitaniya, Vesna is the beloved "Heart" who counters her brother's harsh methods with her benevolence.
</li><li> As the Alicorn god of Ponykind, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Golden Scepter</a> is essentially this trope since he embodies both Ponykind's good and bad traits. It's because of this that Golden Scepter has to constantly regulate his own actions and behavior with a "balance check" where he must know Good to do Evil, while doing Good requires knowing Evil. Favoring one side over the other will either lead to him becoming an incompetent puppet for his subjects to manipulate or a divine tyrant that would be eventually overthrown, the latter which happened to him and nearly ended his life during the Imperium era. Ironically, despite being an ancient god, this trope makes him more "human" than a large majority of the Codexverse's gods, and learning about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodNeedsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodNeedsEvil">Good Needs Evil</a> philosophy from Belyolen and Temnobog during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">one of his adventures</a> was what allowed him to become a very successful ruler come the Fourth Age. It's also because he embodies Ponykind's dual morality that Belyolen and Temnobog have started respected and even befriended him, as in their eyes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">he represents the god and ruler they could have been had their father, Irminsul, not tried to erase the flaws of his then-unborn son</a>.

<ul><li> This is the main plot of the Russian film. The eponymous group are the forces of good who stop the forces of evil (The Day Watch, to be the title of the sequel) from becoming too strong.

Order and Chaos are the basic components of the world, tightly bound together to create matter. Mages who use only Order or Chaos release an equal amount of the other component into the world. As such, the more an Order-mage creates, the more Chaos will be available for a Chaos-mage to wield. This poses the largest problem for Order-mages as Ordered creations are enduring while Chaos is fleeting; there is almost always a surplus of the latter. Chaos and Order are not Good and Evil, as illustrated by heroes throughout the series who wield one or the other, or even, in rare cases, both in equal measure. Absolute Order is death, as living things need to change, evolve and grow (a form of Chaos) but also need structure (a form of Order) or they will collapse. Usually only the central character is really conscious of it and strives to maintain the Balance, while the wizards on either side try to have *more* Order or Chaos, which usually backfires. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Both Fairhaven and Recluce are destroyed, at different times, by Gray wizards</span>.

<ul><li> One part of the Druid's job description in the early editions of the game is "Keeper of the Balance", a reference to both the balance between Good and Evil, and the one between Law (Order) and Chaos. To facilitate this, Druids had to be Neutral in alignment in the original basic set. In the later editions, they only need to be <em>partially</em> neutral; the alignments are the nine combinations of [good, neutral, evil] and [law, neutral, chaos]. In the basic game, neutral was one of the three alignments, along with law and chaos.
</li><li> It's stated on occasion that the gods won't interfere directly much, because doing so will inspire opposing gods to step in and add their own influence.
</li><li> Concordant Killers are outsiders that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornOfHeavenAndHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornOfHeavenAndHell">part-celestial, part-fiend</a>, supposedly created by gods of Neutrality to preserve the cosmic balance. Their ability to overcome any non-True Neutral outsider's defenses with their attacks makes Concordant Killers master assassins, and they'll work for any patron, but collectively track their kills to ensure that they don't favor any one alignment over another.
</li><li> In the D&amp;D 4th edition core setting, the balance between good and evil is maintained by the primordials, a group of god-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">eldritch abominations</a> who are at war with the gods. The war's mostly cooled off, but could flare again at any moment. Because of this, the good gods and evil gods are loath to battle each other; the evil gods know that if they were to slay their good counterparts and take over the cosmos, they'd rule for about five minutes before the primordials swarmed them. Likewise, the good gods know the villain they slay today could be the ally that would have saved them from a primordial tomorrow. Not all the gods play by these rules, and some are even likely to come down on the side of the primordials when the fight starts up again, but for the most part the looming threat keeps the peace between them.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> campaign setting's backstory shows us why this whole balance business is necessary. After a hero wielding the eponymous weapon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">defeated and banished</a> the evil goddess Takhisis, things improved quickly, but with no real bad guys to fight, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Church of Paladine</a> began persecuting anyone who wasn't good <em>enough</em>. Then, their Pope-analog decided that to purge evil from the world completely, he needed to become a god. The gods' answer to this was to throw a mountain down on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyCity">Ishtar</a>, causing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering">Cataclysm</a>, sending Ishtar to the bottom of the sea and reshaping much of the world. The gods then disappeared from the world. In short, if there's no Evil, some of the Good <em>becomes</em> Evil to compensate. If there's too much Evil, then the Evil turns on itself and kills itself off. It's a kind of self-maintaining balance. There are also forces of Neutral that work to maintain that balance, most visibly the neutral gods of the pantheon and the red-robed wizards of the towers of high sorcery.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a></em> setting has the Circle of Eight, an order composed primarily of wizards and lead by Mordenkainen to maintain (Mordenkainen's vision of) the balance. Keeping Evil around is required to keep Good working together and on the ball, lest they start with the infighting as mortals are wont to do. No, not all good guys are on the same side on Oerth by default — they need someone on the outside pushing them together.

<ul><li> The Rilmani are living embodiments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a>, much like how Devils are the embodiments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> or Aasimon (angels) are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfGood">Made of Good</a>. The Rilmani are concerned with balance because "Good" and "Evil" (and Law and Chaos) aren't just points of view, but very real metaphysical forces that compose the multiverse. Too great an imbalance has serious cosmological implications. It would be like tinkering with the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction">fundamental forces<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in particle physics.
</li><li> One example of such cosmological implications can be found on the plane of Outland. It's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> plane said to be the "hub" of the Great Wheel of the multiverse, and as such borders all of the Outer Planes. In a great circle equidistant from Outland's center are a series of portal towns with links to a particular outer plane, which is obviously a great boon for merchants or adventurers looking to travel around the Great Wheel without a high-level spellcaster's help. The problem is that if the overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignment</a> of one of those town's populations reaches a certain tipping point, the town and everyone in it spontaneously vanishes from Outland to merge with its parent plane, which can be very unpleasant if said plane is one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Lower Planes</a>. As such, the merchants and others interested in keeping the portal towns on Outland try to work to make sure there's a bit of darkness in Ecstasy, some light in Hopeless, a bit of order in Xaos and some spontaneity to Automata.

<ul><li> In the game's mythology, the major source of conflict both in the game and throughout all of reality was the corruption of the force of balance known as the Wyrm. The Wyld (chaos) and the Weaver (order) would simultaneously work to conceive new things and give them form, respectively, and the Wyrm (entropy) would destroy those things whose time had passed in order to provide raw materials (and space) for new things to be created. Eventually, sick of having everything it made torn apart and destroyed, the Weaver entangled the Wyrm in its web, driving the Wyrm insane and turning it into the force of evil and corruption instead of balance and natural decay.
</li><li> The Kitsune (werefoxes) had appeared in a book before the release of <em>Hengeyokai</em>, in which they took on a considerably different role; they were cast as the agents of the Balance Wyrm, and were purported to take that responsibility very seriously. Aside from the short write-up in the back of an unrelated sourcebook, though, they never appeared in other material in that form before being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retconned</a> into the tricksters of the Beast Court (where the were-snakes filled the roles of Balance Wyrm's agents).

The human population believes that the angel Avacyn is the savior of humanity who has prevented them from being wiped out by the variety of monsters in their world. Only a few people know the truth that Avacyn's actual purpose is to maintain balance so that vampires don't exhaust their food supply.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> has a form of this in the backstory, where a war that spanned the galaxy between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors">the Great Old Ones</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">the Necrontyr</a> had escalated, then died down, then escalated again when the Necrontyr encountered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">the C'tan</a> and transformed themselves into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation">Necrons</a>. When the Great Old Ones pitted their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">psychic technology</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke">biological technology</a> against the Necrons' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology">new, incomprehensible hi-tech</a>...well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">the details are sketchy</a>, but what's certain is that the Great Old Ones lost and presumably went extinct, and the Necrons overthrew the C'tan and went into hibernation. Interestingly, when the war surged up again, it was just a pretense put forth by the Necron known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">the Silent King</a> in a bid to unify his race <em>just to</em> overthrow the C'tan.
<ul><li> When all was said and done, this war decimated the galaxy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceOrHyperspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceOrHyperspace">the Warp</a>, being a sink for the psychic energy of emotion and souls, turned from quiet and peaceful to becoming a violent, psychotic plane infested by daemons born from the its raw negative energy. And thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Chaos</a> was born.
<ul><li> Weirdly, Chaos also turned into Evil balancing Evil. Chaos has coalesced itself into an unknown number of greater entities, including the high pantheon of four Gods, who are all rivals and are locked in a constant war called the Great Game, that by its nature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">can never end</a>. If one god makes gains against another, he would lose eventually lose them due to retaliation or another god making headway against him. If one god makes substantial gains, the others would team up against him until a semblance of balance was reasserted. One side can't win, because victory would mean the Warp would stop churning with violence and thus the end of Chaos; one side can't lose because it would always have enough strength to reassert itself; no side would stop fighting due to surrender or agreement to peace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">because that's fundamentally against their nature</a>. It's said that if they turned their attention from one another they could easily conquer realspace, but it's only a very powerful mutual threat or the promise of drowning the galaxy into the Warp that can get them to stop fighting just long enough to team up.
</li><li> And then there's Tzeentch, who actively plot against <em>himself</em> in addition to the other three Chaos gods (and the Eldar gods, and the Necron gods, and the Emperor, and...): because he's the personification of hope, his final victory against the others would leave him with no one to plot against, and thus defeat his own purpose for existence. So, all his long-running and convoluted plans-within-plans require some of the others to fail in order to work.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Emperor</a>, who works to keep Chaos at bay from realspace, and humanity in particular. The Imperium has stayed stable, although not making any meaningful progress in any sense, for ten millennia. It's not a balance of Good and Evil by nature, but more by awful circumstances that hasn't changed in much meaningful ways for as long as the Imperium as we know it stood.

<ul><li> The necromancers of the franchise base their actions on the notion of a Balance. The novels attempt to (not always successfully) play with this. In one book, the villain is a necromancer who points out that all the necromancers do is fight evil, which doesn't adhere to the concept of a Balance. The hero of the book, another necromancer, continues to fight him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedEvil">but doesn't bother to explain why he's wrong.</a> In another book, the Balance is interestingly defined not as Good and Evil, but Good and the absence of Evil. It's explained that light and dark are not necessarily good and evil, and while the balance tipping to evil would mean torment, the absence of evil would lead to stagnation. One additional point to consider that the Balance is sometimes portrayed (though not described as) not as being between good and evil, but making sure that neither the angels or the demons of the series gain too much of a foothold in the world, as both are jerks.

The problem is that the elemental Empyreans are so powerful that when they are awake, their mere existence destabilizes the world; Innominat is needed to suppress their power and keep the world stable. Thus the world is locked in a vicious cycle; the elemental Empyreans work for centuries to help human civilization prosper, then Innominat is summoned to devour Malevolence and force the elemental Empyreans to sleep. Once all the Malevolence is gone (because it's produced by human emotions and Innominat has suppressed that), then Innominat returns to slumber and the elemental Empyreans awaken again. By the time of the game, Innominat has found a way to break this cycle and rule humanity forever by having a "farm" filled with trapped dragons, immortal monsters that will produce Malevolence for him to feed on.

She is neither benevolent nor evil, and will actively aid either one depending on which currently has more power or influence. Her theme song, "Equilibrium", demonstrates this as the lyrics tell the story of a girl who lost her father in a war and was then beaten by her grief-stricken mother.

Turaga Nuju tells the player the two forces work in tandem and that the world is in constant flux. The Makuta itself also says as much when it finally appears, arguing that no matter what the Toa do to stop him, he cannot be destroyed "for he is nothing". The game developers compared Makuta to people taking apart their Lego toys to make something else — a necessary act of destruction that allows for creation. And in the game, Makuta is indeed made up of discarded <em>Bionicle</em> pieces that coalesce into whatever it wills. This portrayal of Makuta was however abandoned outside of the game. Other media presented him as an egomaniac villain who was not a primal force of the universe, but was still powerful enough to cause whatever destruction he wanted.

However, the job was so great that he went rogue, with the ultimate goal of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">destroying the universe and remaking it</span> according to his own ideas of "balance."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>, the Mortis arc introduces The Ones who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">living embodiment of the force</a>. While the Daughter represents the Light Side, and the Son represents the Dark, the Father is the balance between both sides.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> introduces another force of balance—the Bendu, who lives on Atollon and describes himself as "the one in the middle" of the light and dark sides.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> Imaginationland trilogy, Imaginationland is divided between Good characters and Evil characters who were minding their own businesses on their separate territories. However, then a terrorist cell attacks Imaginationland to destroy collective imagination. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar">Their plan is to manipulate the Good and Evil characters into war and wipe each other out.</a></span> The story strays and it becomes a blatant Good vs. Evil battle with full support of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Good characters</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who win the war and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">even those who were killed are resurrected, including Strawberry Shortcake,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">against the terrorist's posthumous plans.</a></span> Neither the Good nor Evil characters were responsible for starting the war.
</li><li> In the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>, the Xiaolin Grand Master Dashi spread the Shen Gong Wu across the world after sealing Wuya away in a puzzle box so that they could maintain the balance between good and evil. When Jack Spicer released Wuya from the puzzle box, her presence caused the balance to shift, reactivating the Shen Gong Wu and triggering the conflict throughout the series.
