Used at least once for almost every LGBT character ever, but most often seen with lesbian or gay characters, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals">No Bisexuals</a> trope and trans characters still being rare as well (as are asexual, pansexual, etc. characters). In any case, while coming out certainly happens in real life, the coming out story trope has certain standard stereotypical notes that every telling of it hits, no matter who the characters involved are.
</p><p>Although there are only so many variations you can do with it, you can be assured that any LGBT cast member of a show will relate it to someone at one point, or have it shown one person in their life will wholeheartedly support them, while at least another will turn out to be homophobic (even if they gave no indication of ever being so in the past) and will hate them. When parents are involved, they will either furiously throw their own child out of the home for this revelation, or reveal that they suspected all along, but were content to wait for their child to feel comfortable enough to admit it. Also usually includes a hate crime somewhere in the story.

It also might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">payoff for a character who has long been giving hints</a>, in which case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset">few are surprised</a>.

If the characters are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay">ensemble of LGBT characters</a>, usually this plot is assigned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTwink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTwink">The Twink</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian">Lipstick Lesbian</a>. If not, then this will almost always be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop">Gay Aesop</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers">Sweet Blue Flowers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fumi has her coming out toward her best friend Akira at their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalHangout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LocalHangout">favorite hang-out spot</a>, when she tells her that she's dating a senior from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderSchool">all-girl high school</a>. Akira is a bit surprised at first, but soon decides to support her friend fully. Luckily, there are no homophobes in this series, and the emphasis is more on the relationship between Akira and Fumi in light of this development.
</li><li> Played with as well; In what appears to be a more stereotypical form of the trope, Yasuko invites Fumi to meet her family, and states to them during dinner that they're dating. The response from Yasuko's sister, however, is for her to repeatedly ask whether Yasuko's really in love with Fumi, before delivering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "So you're bisexual, Yasuko."</span> Fumi had no idea that Yasuko <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wasn't a lesbian</span>, and it leads to Yasuko <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> breaking up with Fumi over her unrequited feelings for her old teacher, pointing out that Fumi has her own unrequited love to get over as well.</span> Yasuko's family, it should be noted, were fine with it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em>, made by the same mangaka who makes <em>Sweet Blue Flowers</em>, has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Transgender</a> variant, mixed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory">Coming-of-Age Story</a>. Both Nitori and Takatsuki are not reluctant to tell people of their wishes to be seen as a girl and a boy, though Takatsuki is more worrisome. The beginning of the manga began with them two meeting in fifth grade, and soon after telling each other of their wishes. Both of them feel the need to start dressing as the opposite sex around that time, but their parents either don't notice or think it's a confusing phase. Takatsuki's anxiety <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">foreshadows her gender confusion as a teenager</span>. In contrast, Nitori's arc ends with the implications that she'll transition now that she's off to college.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveMyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveMyLife">Love My Life</a></em>. At the start of the story, Ichiko comes out to her father by introducing him to her girlfriend... only for <em>him</em> to reveal that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist">he's gay and Ichiko's mother was a lesbian, and that the two of them only got married because they wanted to have a family.</a> Notably, none of the story's gay characters ever come out to society in general.
</li><li> Marika from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai">Bokura no Hentai</a></em> is a trans girl who has been dressing up as a girl in secret for some time. After persuasion from her friend Satoshi and his family, along with fears of puberty, she comes out to her mom and begins living as a girl.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveMeForWhoIAm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveMeForWhoIAm">Love Me For Who I Am</a></em>:
<ul><li> A good chunk of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kotone</span>'s character arc is her coming to terms with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst">gayngst</a> and coming out of the closet. When taken to gay rights festival by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a> friends while still closeted, she ends up breaking down crying after seeing all the happy lesbian couples.
</li><li> There are also a few other, less obvious, Coming Out Stories: Mogumo learning about their non-binary identity and how to be openly enby, Suzu being in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship">Secret Relationship</a> with his boyfriend and learning to be more open, and Mei learning that it's okay to be seen a trans girl instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">Wholesome Crossdresser</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SteadyBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SteadyBeat">Steady Beat</a></em> is a well done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory">Coming-Out Story</a>; nobody comes out...yet, but the main character discovering that her sister is apparently a lesbian is the motivator for the plot. Her own reaction is more confused and upset than homophobic.
</li><li> Spoofed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a></em>. The character Wiccan is reluctantly trying to tell his parents he became a superhero, but they misunderstand and assume he's coming out with his boyfriend. They're supportive of his sexuality, but no word yet on his choice of profession since he didn't get a chance to say anything about it. Also Marvel planned on slowly hinting, then having a big reveal that Hulkling and Wiccan are gay and a couple, but readers figured it out long beforehand. Marvel then had it casually mentioned in one issue instead of making it a shocking reveal.
</li><li> Averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim">Scott Pilgrim</a></em>, where most gay characters are already out by the time they are introduced. While bi-curiosity abounds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(Ramona dated a girl for some time but eventually didn't really consider herself bisexual, Knives and Kim drunkenly made out but never mentioned it again)</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Stephen Stills</span> is the only one who comes out, and it's done off-screen around Volume 5 without fanfare.
</li><li> Alison Bechdel's autobiographical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FunHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FunHome">Fun Home</a></em> details her coming out as a lesbian, and while her mom writes a letter expressing disappointment (Alison herself noting "As disapproval goes, I suppose it was rather mild"), and she finds supportive people (her roommate responds "Oh cool! Can I tell my friends?") the main crux of it is how it spurred Alison to learn of her own father's closeted homosexuality. Her father, tragically, never has his coming-out. She also published her coming out story in comic form in 1993 in Gay Comics (Early Summer 1993, #19). You can <a class="urllink" href="http://www.oberlinlgbt.org/bechdel/bechdel-1.html">read it here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">furry comic</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Circles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Circles">Circles</a></em>, Marty is eventually forced to come out to his parents and godmother when they inadvertently force the issue during at visit to his boarding house. As it turns out, his parents had a wager where the mother thought he was gay while the father was holding out for him being bisexual so grandchildren could still be possible from him. As for the godmother, she is so obtuse that she doesn't understand the confession in the first place.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a> (Katherine "Kate" Kane) came out as gay and was kicked out of West Point under the "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell">Dont Ask Don't Tell" policy.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Her commanding officer had given her the chance to deny the whole thing and have it swept under the rug, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillNotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillNotTellALie">but Kate refused to lie and compromise her personal honor</a>. When she comes out to her father, he is awesome:

Ultimately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IhaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IhaveNoSon">her parents disowned her</a>, but she was able to find a modicum of acceptance from the cops she worked with. It's later implied that her parents — or her father at least — upon cooling down a bit have deeply regretted this disownment, but Renee is by this point understandably unwilling to have anything to do with them even if they are willing to mend fences.

</li><li> The whole point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Parrotfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Parrotfish">Parrotfish</a></em> by Ellen Wittlinger, only the main character Grady is coming out as transgender. Lacks most of the cliches associated with Coming Out Stories, in that Grady was almost in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset">Transparent Closet</a>, so it didn't surprise his family at all, and most people at school ignored him anyway.
</li><li> Occurs in <em>Absolutely Positively Not Gay</em> to the main character. He actually comes out multiple times in the book; once, he comes out to his best friend, is confused when she doesn't care, and then has a mini panic attack when she tells her parents. Her 6-year-old sibling comes into the room and asks, "Did he finally tell her he's gay?" His coming out to his parents is actually interestingly subverted. He comes out to each parent separately. Both are fine with it but tell him not to come out to the other just yet, as they don't think the other person will be as supportive.
</li><li> There are quite a few books of lesbian coming out stories, for example this one called <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Testimonies-Lesbian-Coming-Out-Stories--Updated-Revised/dp/1555835465/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1282162105&amp;sr=1-2">Testimonies: Lesbian Coming-Out Stories.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> There are also some books of gay men's coming out stories, for example <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Like-Us-Writers-Stories/dp/0380788357/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382726840&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=gay+men+coming+out">Boys Like Us: Gay Writers Tell Their Coming Out Stories.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

The main plot of the book is them trying to start a family with the embryos Zoe and her husband froze after IVF treatments. However, the book has all the cliches of this storyline, such as one character supporting her (her mom) and one character being homophobic out of nowhere (justified, because her husband had just converted to Christianity).

</li><li> Surprisingly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AutobiographyOfRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AutobiographyOfRed">Autobiography of Red</a></em>.

It culminates in his confessing that he's straight to the other man and worrying that he'd "be letting everyone down."
</li><li> Used straight in the Argentine series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Graduados" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Graduados">Graduados</a>. Several former classmates who are now in their forties have a reunion meeting, to see the others once more. Guillermo Almada invites everyone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">reveal a hidden secret</a>: when it was his turn, he revealed that he is gay, and has already been gay in their high schools days. Most of them understood and supported him. Vicky had her heart broken: she had a crush on him, she still had it, and now it's pointless. Pablo, the former school bully, reacts in a completely homophobic way, and insults Guillermo about this at each chance he gets since then.
</li><li> Appears as a major plot point in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DalzielAndPascoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DalzielAndPascoe">Dalziel and Pascoe</a></em> episode, <em>Child's Play</em>.

One two-parter episode had the story of Will's coming out. Another one had Jack and Will refer to a gay bookstore as a collection of numerous coming out tales, all more or less the same.

<ul><li> And Riley's in the ninth season.
<ul><li> Actually, his is a subversion. He finally admits he's gay but stays in the closet to everyone except Peter.
</li></ul></li><li> (Perhaps because) he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">transgender</a>, not gay, Adam came out to his family and began living as male some time before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent">transferring</a> to Degrassi.

When his parents visit town, however, his friends' attempts to act as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">beards</a> convince them that Max is dating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">a married woman, his best friend's ex and a Nazi</a>, so he comes out reluctantly and after two minutes of surprise they're totally fine with it.

The third season is all about Spencer being out and Proud, calling out her mother's homophobia, going to Pride, getting LGBT-friends and so on.</span> She never has any big "I am Gay"-scene, since pretty much everyone she knows figures it out on their own or by walking in on her and Ashley in compromising situations. The closest thing she has is when she was given the chance to deny it and chose not to.
<div class="indent"><strong>Chelsea:</strong> I think it is really great that you are planning this party for Ashley. <br/><strong>Spencer:</strong> Yeah well, she is my best friend. <br/><strong>Chelsea:</strong> [coyly] Isn't she more than just a friend? <br/><strong>Spencer:</strong> Uh... yeah...

<ul><li> Kevin, who is in his thirties, and his Uncle Saul. Saul had a particularly hard time with it, since he was an older man, though the family was very supportive of them both.
</li></ul></li><li> The most infamous example has to be from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ellen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ellen">Ellen</a></em>, where it was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>. In case you've been living under a rock, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllenDeGeneres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllenDeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a> came out as a lesbian, and then shortly afterwards her character Ellen Morgan did as well.

</li><li> Inverted as well in an old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> sketch:
<div class="indent"><strong>Son</strong>: Dad... I'm... I'm straight. <br/><strong>Father</strong>: What?! <br/><strong>Son</strong>: I said I'm straight, Dad.

I happen to have a, uh, a girlfriend. <br/><strong>Father</strong>: Stop it! I don't wanna hear about it! Where did I go wrong? I mean, I tried to give you a nice home. I sent you to YMCA summer camp. I should have played with you more when you were a baby!

</li><li> Also parodied in a sketch where a boy's parents have been telling the whole town that their (straight) son is gay. When the son finds out about it, the mom says, "This isn't how we wanted you to find out," and the dad says, "I feel like a great weight has been lifted!" When he insists he isn't gay, the dad starts yelling. "No gay son of mine is a not-gay!"
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in a different manner with another sketch by Chilean show <em>El Club de la Comedia</em>: One of a gay couple comes out as straight, nervous and tearful that his husband won't accept it... and then it turns out the husband's <em>not gay either</em>. They decide to forget the last few married years and just go to a disco and pick up a few girls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty">Ugly Betty</a></em>:
<ul><li> Marc comes out to his mother. The standard setup is subverted somewhat in that his colleagues already know he's gay and don't care, but his mother absolutely rejects him after he comes out (which Marc suspected would happen). No happy ending for him, at least not now.
</li><li> When Justin finally came out in the second to last episode, his family went in the extreme opposite direction, being supportive to the point of being embarrassing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoahsArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoahsArc">Noah's Arc</a></em>: Not a full story, but in the movie we get to see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wade and Brandon's (also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst">Gayngst</a>)</span> coming out.
</li><li> The standard American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> approach is to phase the gay character out shortly after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory">Coming-Out Story</a> has played out - particularly if the character in question is male.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a></em> famously did it with Bianca, a legacy character, daughter of Erica Kane (the soap's most important character) when Bianca was sixteen. They stuck by it and gave Bianca a few girlfriends and even a wife; too bad it took years to let her actually be affectionate with any of her love interest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns">As the World Turns</a></em> has recently proven to be a notable exception, not only running through the trope twice - first with a main character, then with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmouredClosetGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmouredClosetGay">prospective love interest</a> - but continuing to integrate the characters into the usual roundelay of kidnappings, murders, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientComa">convenient comas</a>, etc. Averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay">Reid</a>, who was out and comfortable about his sexuality, which didn't define his character. The reason why most people didn't know he was gay was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk">no one bothered to ask</a>, though much of the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">suspected</a> he was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em> did it with Lucas Jones, after trying to pair him up with not one but both of his female, adoptive first cousins. Sadly, Lucas has not been seen since his (adoptive) father <strike>was killed by the writers</strike> died during Sweeps Week.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">Lucas finally returned</a> in 2014, eight years after his last appearance. His first major storyline upon his return was meeting his newly discovered biological father and coming out to him.
</li></ul></li><li> British or international soaps seem to handle it with a bit more truth. Syed's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory">Coming-Out Story</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders">EastEnders</a></em> is quite painful.
<ul><li> Talking about painful. Tough guy Phil Mitchell just wanted his son Ben to be like him while Ben just wants his father's approval. Unfortunately, Ben is everything Phil isn't and Phil long suspected his son was gay. When Ben finally reveals he's gay, Phil puts his arms on Ben's shoulders, leaving the viewer unsure of whether he's going to hug or strangle him, before he breaks down in tears and runs off.
</li></ul></li><li> The famous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HollyOaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HollyOaks">HollyOaks</a></em> John Paul and Craig story involved both of them coming out, John Paul months before Craig, although Craig's was more dramatic than John Paul's. John Paul was created as a gay character, but Craig had been on the show a lot longer and was originally straight. They managed to avoid it being a mess by making it less of a coming out as gay story and more a coming out as in love with John Paul story.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Done in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a> fashion in the second season when Buffy's mother Joyce finds out about her being a slayer. She even asks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouTriedNotBeingAMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouTriedNotBeingAMonster">"Have you tried not being a Slayer?"</a> and "It's because you didn't have a strong father figure, isn't it?". In Season Three, Joyce continued this metaphor describing herself as "marching in the Slayer Pride Parade."
</li><li> Subverted with Willow in Season 4. She gets the support of her friends (particularly Buffy), but there isn't a homophobic reaction in sight—there is some shock at first among her friends, but they overcome it quickly. The only person who has any kind of negative reaction is Willow's ex-boyfriend, Oz, who was interested in getting back together with her (and whose return prompted Willow to come out to Buffy). He doesn't say a word about the fact that she's fallen in love with a girl; he's upset that he's lost his chance. More importantly, Willow coming out is the secondary plotline of the episode.
</li><li> Averted with Larry, who privately comes out to Xander, and later makes mention in later episodes that he had the school paper print a coming-out notice for him and that he's "so out I have my grandmother setting up dates".
</li><li> Interestingly the heterosexual relationship between Buffy and vampire Spike <em>does</em> follow this trope, with Tara as the supportive friend (she even uses the term "coming out") and Xander as the hostile one. In "Normal Again" Spike tells Buffy she should tell the others about them so they'll either support her, or drive her out so Spuffy can be together on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSide">Dark Side</a>. Contrary to Spike's hopes and Buffy's fears, when their relationship does come out into the open her friends, once they've overcome their initial shock, <em>are</em> non-judgemental about it, even Xander and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> Giles.

Geoffrey later has a horrible relapse, although he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">fine by the next episode</a></span>.
</li><li> In the last episode, it's established that none of his students are paying attention because it's the last day of school, and he and Jellineck take the opportunity to tell them about the "HOT, ASS-THUMPING SEX" they enjoy on a regular basis. Sure enough, no reaction.
</li></ul></li><li> Justin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTwink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTwink">The Twink</a> of the American version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk">Queer as Folk</a></em>, deals with coming out to his parents. Supportive parent? Check. Homophobic parent? Check. Hate crime? Check. Three for three.
</li><li> Several of the women on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLWord">The L Word</a></em> deal with coming out. In the case of the original characters it was either dealt with as the show progressed, or related in flashback (they even had a "coming out story" storytelling episode). Also happened with for several characters who were additions to the cast and started out as straight or closeted.
<ul><li> Subverted with Shane's coming out story, in the storytelling episode, where Shane <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> falls in love with a girl on the playground when she was a kid.</span> Not really a coming out story, though.
</li></ul></li><li> Both spoofed and subverted in <em>The Catherine Tate Show</em>. One series of skits featuring <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooWIoSwEsZo">a man named John coming out to his family.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This is set up to be a stereotypical encounter, since he lives in a seemingly lower-class neighborhood. However, his family is outright <em>delighted</em> to have a gay man in the family, hilariously over-supporting him and parading him around town to everyone they meet. And everyone he encounters treat his sexuality as a godsend (even <em>street punks</em>), giving him gifts, asking for advice, and generally making a much bigger deal out of it than poor John intended.
<ul><li> "I'm with the woofter" could pretty much be its own trope.
</li><li> Made all the more hilarious by the fact it's set in lower-class Belfast. It is... generally ... unusual for people from Belfast to be portrayed as anything other than stubborn terrorists. Which is part of the joke. The family <em>are</em> portrayed as stubborn terrorists (giving each other balaclavas and knuckle-dusters for Christmas), just really open-minded and supportive stubborn terrorists.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrailerParkBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrailerParkBoys">Trailer Park Boys</a></em> made use of this trope in a memorable fourth-season episode. In the first season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Randy and Mr. Lahey</a> obtained a compromising video of Ricky acting in one of J-Roc's porn films, which could ruin his relationship with Lucy. When Julian tries breaking into Lahey's trailer to steal the video, he comes across Randy and Lahey in a compromising "position" of their own, and agrees to keep quiet about their relationship in exchange for the tape. A few years later, their relationship comes out when Ricky's car goes out of control and crashes into Randy and Lahey's trailer. Lahey emerges dressed as the Lone Ranger, and when Julian rescues Randy from the wreckage, he finds that Randy is wearing a bumblebee costume. Everyone except Julian is confused about this, when Randy finally says that he and Mr. Lahey shouldn't be ashamed of who they are, and loudly announces to the trailer park that he and Lahey are gay. In later episodes, Randy and Lahey have no problem with displaying their relationship in public, and none of the other trailer park residents really bother them about it.
</li><li> Hilariously subverted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em> when Red befriends his football-crazy neighbors. Red comes to accept the neighbors' gay relationship, but his budding friendship turns into passionate hatred when he finds out the two men are Minnesota Vikings fans. As a diehard Green Bay Packers fan, Red is outraged and screams at the "freaks" to get out of his house.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> episode "All About My Brother" is Serena's brother Eric's. This being <em>Gossip Girl</em>, his outing wasn't complete without Gossip Girl-fueled rumors and scandal, mostly having to do with his closeted love interest, who was using Jenny as a beard.
</li><li> Played with in an episode of the British-Indian sketch show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodnessGraciousMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodnessGraciousMe">Goodness Gracious Me</a></em> - after his parents steadfastly ignore his increasingly blatant hints about how stereotypically gay he is, the son blurts out that he and his "friend" Simon are in love; "Simon?" tuts his mother, "you couldn't find a nice Indian boy?"
</li><li> Sanjay's hilarious coming out story on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds">Weeds</a></em> occurs midway through a hostage situation, in which both the man holding him hostage (U-Turn) and a fellow hostage (Conrad) become totally preoccupied with whether he's actually gay or just thinks he is. U-Turn waves a gun in his face and insists what he needs is Jesus, before ordering Sanjay to have sex with one of his (U-Turn's) hookers to make sure. The hooker opines that he is in fact gay. Lampshaded by the fact that he was (literally) hiding in a closet and his kidnapper yelled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">"Come out of the closet"!</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kurt comes out to Mercedes early on, who had no idea. Well... she knew, but then the cheerleaders convinced her he wasn't. He later comes out to his dad, but it turns out he knew all along: "I've known since you were three. All you wanted for your birthday was a pair of sensible heels."
</li><li> In Season 2, Santana comes out to herself as a lesbian, but hasn't officially told anyone but Holly and Brittany, though several other people probably know. Karofsky has yet to be out to anyone but Kurt. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By season 3, both have been unwillingly outed, and both suffer consequences as a result.</span>

The group is all fine with it - unfortunately for Emily, though, her mum and twin sister aren't so supportive.
<ul><li> In Katie's defense, it appears that it is not so much about Emily dating a woman as it is about her dating <em>anyone</em>, and thus separating herself from her. Check out their big reconciliation <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTk6F8YJEnQ">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (starts 4 minutes in).

</li></ul></li><li> Played surprisingly, um, straight in the otherwise crass Fox sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWarAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWarAtHome">The War at Home</a></em>, when former (unconfirmed) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetHomosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetHomosexual">Pet Homosexual</a> Dave ends up coming out to his best friend's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> father, who has been joking about him being gay behind his back:

Whew. Original show, that.
</li></ul></li><li> Hilariously parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleBritain">Little Britain</a></em> when Daffyd, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">only gay in the village</a>", comes out to his parent, wanting them to shun him. They basically shrug their shoulders and start talking about setting him up with his father's coworker.
</li><li> Done in three storylines on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours">Neighbours</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lana Crawford, a new student at Erinsborough High who made friends with Sky after a poor first impression. When Lana kissed Sky during a sleepover, Sky figured it out and gradually convinced her to come out (to herself as much as to Sky). Not long after she was publicly outed by Sky's cousin and it took a while for her to decide to stop denying the rumors.
</li><li> Donna Freedman had quite a subtle one when she came out as bisexual to her friend Bridget. They were discussing their 'first time' and Donna asked her friend if hers was with a guy or a girl
</li><li> A more recent example was Chris Pappas, who unlike Lana, eventually became a regular cast member. Chris was dating Summer at the time, but began to realize he was gay when he developed feelings for their friend Andrew. When their teacher Michael, as a class assignment, asked everyone to write down a secret or record a secret, Chris recorded it on his iPod. It was later confiscated and Chris mistakenly believed Michael had heard the recording. Michael figured it out from his reaction, and he later researched the subject on his home computer. Natasha found the sites in his internet history and figured out that one of her classmates had come out to him. She quickly started the rumor mill going. Nevertheless, Chris came out to Summer and Andrew and all were able to overcome the awkwardness between them.
</li></ul></li><li> Michael gets one in a later season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFamily">My Family</a></em>. Ben is shellshocked, but eventually comes to accept it. Susan has a harder time dealing with it, but mostly only because Michael chose to came out to Ben and not to her.

<div class="indent"><strong>Emily:</strong> Why did you think I would take Maya to the dance? <br/><strong>Hanna:</strong> What? <br/><strong>Emily:</strong> You thought I wanted her as my date. Why? <br/><strong>Hanna:</strong> A sent me a picture of you and Maya kissing. So, can I just ask  You took Toby to the dance, but then you took that picture with Maya? <br/><strong>Emily:</strong> [Pregnant pause] ... I think I know what I want. ... But if I say yes to Maya, everything would change. You know it would. <br/><strong>Hanna:</strong> Yeah, it would. You wouldnt have to pretend youre someone youre not. <br/><strong>Emily:</strong> But what if Im wrong?

</div></li><li> There was also Paige, a member of Emily's swim team and later girlfriend. When we first meet her in season one she's pretty much locked herself into the closet due to her father's rather negative views on homosexuality and when she starts dating Emily (by this time out of the closet and secure in her sexuality) she always wants their dates to be out of the way so that no one who knows her will see them together. Despite Emily's encouragement to come out, even going so far as to set her up with a support group, Paige backs out and they break up. Then when we meet Paige again in season 2 she reveals that she came out to her parents (apparently screaming and crying was involved) and she seems quite a bit happier.

It seems as though Kenny leads a perfect life, but Earl notices that Kenny is lonely and decides to help him find a girlfriend. When that doesn't work, they resort to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Streetwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Streetwalker">Patty the Daytime Hooker</a>, and when that fails, Earl and Randy question Kenny...and Randy finds Kenny's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash">Porn Stash</a>.

<ul><li> Calvin Owens is accidentally outed to his Omega Chi brothers by Ashleigh. After an episode of dirty looks from most of them (his big brother Evan is supportive), he de-pledges. It takes a few episodes (and Evan kicking out the more homophobic elements in Omega Chi) and a courtship with Kappa Tau for Calvin to re-pledge.
</li><li> It's also parodied with Calvin's on-again, off-again boyfriend Heath, who comes out to his brothers at Kappa Tau. They don't care; in fact, they were more worried he found out that Beaver had hit on his underage sister ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">She does not look 16</a>".)

When he finally came out to his parents, his father David accepted it. His mother Veronica, on the other hand, was very disapproving to the point that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she rather have the survival of her sons that were aborted</span> than have a gay son.

</li><li> The story arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FakingIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FakingIt">Faking It</a></em> is Amy's coming to terms with her own sexuality.

That and getting his abysmal grades up. His friend's reaction range from 'already knew it' or supportive to jerk ass (although that was somewhat more due to the particular character's 'everything's about me' attitude).
</li><li> Mickey Milkovich in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS">Shameless (US)</a></em> comes out in a spectacular speech towards the end of season 4 in front of his violent and homophobic father or risk losing his long-term boyfriend, Ian.

</li><li> Amanda says she thinks her story is "the same as [Volair's]" and rattles off a stereotypical version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory">Coming-Out Story</a>, to which Volair responds that he "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">just likes getting 5% more nookie</a>."
</li><li> In a flashback, Volair is outed to his peers (and himself) by an erection in the shower.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AnsemRetort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AnsemRetort">Ansem Retort</a></em>, Marluxia, who has been stereotypically gay for the entire series finally comes out of the closet in 'season' 5. None of the other cast members are surprised and even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> Zexion finds this reveal to be less interesting than watching Seinfeld reruns.
</li><li> Sara of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyAndAggie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyAndAggie">Penny and Aggie</a></em> undergoes a lengthy and heavily-foreshadowed coming out process, sometimes played for comedy and at other times for drama. Lisa, noticing Sara's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset">Transparent Closet</a> (she's visibly frustrated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">rival title characters</a> not acknowledging their supposed mutual attraction), touches her mock-seductively on the nose, freaking Sara out and leading her to settle the question by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TestKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TestKiss">kissing Marshall</a>. When she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSparks">feels nothing</a> as a result, she realizes she's gay. Subsequent storylines deal with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a> makeover, being slanderously outed to the entire school body as an alleged rapist, eventually finding acceptance (and, in one case, a girlfriend) amongst her friends, and coming out to her mother.
<ul><li> Penny, as well, has been (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting">very</a>) slowly coming to terms with her own bisexuality ever since a comment by a projecting Sara hit too close to home.
</li><li> As of late 2009, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aggie</span> is in the midst of her own coming out process, although whether she's gay or bisexual is not yet clear.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SaturdayMorningBreakfastCereal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SaturdayMorningBreakfastCereal">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal</a></em> features one strip where a woman discusses with a friend how to come out of the closet to her husband...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robosexual">and admit she is a robot.</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=1858#comic">Her friend's suggestion is a bit unorthodox<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

When he calls a staff meeting to come out, the basic reaction is "That's it? You called a meeting for that?". No-one treats him any differently and his sexuality is barely even mentioned afterwards.
</li><li> Hom from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WelcomeToRoom305" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WelcomeToRoom305">Welcome to Room #305</a></em> came out at the very start of the story but it get tossed around a lot on whether or not it's the truth or he's playing a joke. Eventually, it comes out that he is quite gay but hasn't come out to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sung Joong</span>.
</li><li> One major story element in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sunstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sunstone">Sunstone</a></em> is that neither Ally nor Lisa considered themselves to be gay or bi before meeting each other, and have to come to terms with their mutual attraction along with their roles in the D/s part of their relationship. Ally eventually admits it to Alan ("I'm... gay." "Like a rainbow unicorn.") and a future strip teases at how Lisa will eventually introduce her girlfriend to her family.
</li><li> Rae from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AlwaysHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AlwaysHuman">Always Human</a></em> comes out to her friend Sunati as asexual and aromantic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TrippingOverYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TrippingOverYou">Tripping Over You</a></em> is a slice-of-life story about two boys and their relationship in a British boarding school. Milo has been outed rather early by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastHetRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastHetRomance">the last girl he dumped</a> and is quite comfortable with being out meanwhile, and his family doesn't make much of a fuss about it; Liam on the other hand takes a long time to come out in small steps to his roommate, then to a few more of their school friends, and finally to his strict, conservative father Eli.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl">Tomboy and Girly Girl</a> Kat and Paz deal with their feelings for each other after the first girl is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay">Mistaken for Gay</a> (her known crushes have been for guys); after settling her feelings Kat then has to deal with coming out to her best friend Antimony. When the couple is spotted by said friend in a compromising position the friend runs away sending Kat into a panic. Turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she wasn't afraid of Kat being gay (an offhand comment about dating a hot enough woman <em>a year ago</em> was enough for her to accept the possibility that Kat might not be hetero-normative), but that her best (and at times only) friend might leave her.</span> Kat also comes out to an ancient spirit who warns her her friend might not be as open minded as he is; after coming out to Antimony, she worries their spirit pal might be too old-fashioned. The couple later go to a dance and no one seems to care.
</li><li> Lavali of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SandraOnTheRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SandraOnTheRocks">Sandra on the Rocks</a></em> comes out to her brother Alex after tearfully running into his arms for comfort because her girlfriend had just broken up with her. While her sexuality is news to the reader, the following two strips have Alex reveal that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyKnewAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyKnewAlready">he already knew she was gay and so did their parents</a>, since they had caught her in compromising positions with girls on multiple occasions. Up until that point she genuinely believed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a> she used to "explain" the situation each time had successfully kept them all in the dark.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Rain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Rain">RAIN</a></em>, every one of the main characters, with the exception of Gavin, has a coming-out scene - and often more than one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SimplySarah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SimplySarah">Simply Sarah</a></em>, the coming outs happen early into the comic. Sarah tells her mother first and her mum is supportive. Janey is reluctant to tell her more homophobic mother, but she ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedOutOfTheCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedOutOfTheCloset">Forced Out of the Closet</a> when she is caught kissing Sarah.

The "coming out" events that do occur range from slapstick to nightmarish.
</li><li> This is the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/OutWithDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/OutWithDad">Out With Dad</a></em>, with the twist that it's a coming out story for two people - Rose and Vanessa. Neither is out to everyone, but their families both know. Rose gets the supportive reaction from her friend Kenny and her dad, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">Vanessa's mom</a> is... less supportive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Near the end, Nathan tells Rose he's asexual as well, which is fine though she teases him by repeating one of his lines to her from her own coming out.</span>

He gets progressively more descriptive as he wants <em>somebody</em> to react poorly to justify his having been closeted for so long - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and he gets his wish when he mentions that this attraction is due to him being <em>bisexual</em>, not gay, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals">and a litany of "Pick a side!" comments are levelled at him</a></span>.

Of those which have occurred, probably the most significant was Mega Girl coming out as a gender changeling to her boyfriend, Stronghold, at the insistence of the school's headmistress at that. It goes better than she ever hope it might, as he readily accepted her and would stand up for her against homophobic bullies not long afterwards.

Nobody was the least bit surprised, but he later relates all of the people at his job supporting him and acting emotionally to his friends.

He tried to practice by having two of his castmates roleplay as his parents. His first trial run at coming out was met with a reaction of "Uh, DUHHHH!" from his pseudo-parents, which causes Xandir to chastise them for not taking the roleplaying exercise seriously enough. They take things a bit more seriously than he may have hoped, as his <em>second</em> trial run led to an insanely convoluted turn of events parodying an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">after-school special</a>, which killed half the cast (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">So what else is new?</a>) and made little to no sense. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Again, this isn't new</a>. In the end, when he comes out to his real parents, what are their reactions? "Uh, DUHHHH!" Also: when he came out to his girlfriend over the phone, she angrily requested he never save her again, as she is bound and being lowered into a snake pit. Makes Princess Clara look downright tolerant.
