Especially if they used to be mortals who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker">actively wanted to be immortal</a>. The rationale goes:

</li><li> Immortality is bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">in and of itself,</a> even if attained without using evil means. Perhaps it's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">meddling in God's domain</a>", which tends not to end well for the meddler. From a secular viewpoint, perhaps immortality is bad for society even if it's great for individuals. Some works suggest that immortality in itself is damaging to valuing other people's lives: if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayFlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayFlies">most people's lifespans seem to pass in the blink of an eye for you</a>, why care if they end slightly earlier?
</li><li> And, perhaps most obviously, immortality exempts one forever from the possibility of going to Hell. When death is no longer "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAreEqualInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAreEqualInDeath">the great equalizer</a>" and there's absolutely no way you can ever get a truly cosmic punishment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">why should you restrain yourself from doing whatever the hell you want</a>, right up to rape and outright murder?

</p><p>Also note that there are generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">many kinds of immortality</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">Biological immortality</a> (live "until killed", like Tolkien's elves) is usually natural, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">full immortality</a> rarely is (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">gods</a>). A person actively seeking the latter is almost always evil (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a> being a notable exception, although even there the same basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">Fantastic Aesop</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">"Mortal Man should not seek to rise above his station"</a> was enforced).

<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>. While the massacre aboard the <em>Advena Avis</em> suggests the "Immortality is bad" route - they even get immortality through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> - it eventually becomes clear that eternal life is exactly what it claims to be: Life, only (infinitely) longer, while the 'devil' they made a deal with for it is more of an amoral observer than a malevolent force.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BludgeoningAngelDokuroChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BludgeoningAngelDokuroChan">Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan</a></em>, the reason Dokuro has come to the hero is on account of this. According to her, the hero will in the future create a Lolicon paradise by inventing a device that freezes every girl's growth at 12, allowing girls to live forever as eternal Lolitas; since such immortality is God's domain, the hero must be killed or otherwise stopped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> plays it a different way. We don't know the actual origin of immortality in the setting, but for C.C. it qualifies in a different way since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she had her Code forced upon her by the woman she had come to view as a surrogate mother, who was insane and wanted to be free of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">curse of immortality</a>.</span> It's similarly implied later on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when C.C. considered foisting it off on Mao, and later Lelouch, but despite her supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">Ice Queen</a> nature, couldn't bring herself to do it. She might have gone through this before the show, but that part of her past was never covered.</span>
<ul><li> This is just the tip of the iceberg. Immortality is apparently gained in a somewhat immoral way (if you do it that way), through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taking the immortal's "Code".</span> Now, maybe in a good world, it was designed to be in a voluntary way, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charles proves it can be done through deception, without the victim's knowledge or acceptance - after all, V.V. probably wanted to live longer), so this aches to the Sith Rule of Two</span>. But to have immortality, you need Geass, and to get a Geass, a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">former</span> Geass-user, now Immoral Immortal himself/herself has to go to the trouble of giving you the Geass, and he/she will give it only to someone capable of using it to satisfy his needed, which may range to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> qualities needed (like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">C.C. needed the Geass to evolve in Lelouch, finally being able to take on immortality</span>. This may be further complicated if an immortal doesn't want to die, and makes <em>more than a Geass user</em>. The manga expands on this, stating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geass exists to bring chaos to the world, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">thus balance it</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CorpsePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CorpsePrincess">Corpse Princess</a></em> dealt with a doctor who was trying to make people immortal by injecting them with solutions of Shikabane cells in order to save his dying wife. Unfortunately, the quasi-Shikabane ended up dying horribly.
</li><li> Variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">from the point of view</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Shinigami</a>, it's no big deal to increase their own lifespans by killing humans, but for them to use someone's death to <em>increase</em> the life of a <em>human</em> is "forbidden and unnatural," and results in the Shinigami in question immediately dying and crumbling into dust. This may have something to do with the motivation most shinigami have to break that rule (love). Given that any death might potentially increase someone else's lifespan, this prohibition only applies to a Shinigami <em>intentionally</em> saving someone from their intended death.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, the driving point of many a villain was to collect the eponymous mystic orbs in order to summon the Dragon to grant their wish for immortality. While the immortality itself was not portrayed as evil, the fact that everyone searching for it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> that killed countless innocent people (even the eradication of entire civilizations) and the heroes never considered it (even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">former villains</a> lost interest in the idea) does carry the inevitable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">Fantastic Aesop</a> implications. Additionally, the single villain that successfully achieved immortality, Garlic Jr., was subsequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">shoved into a pocket dimension for eternity</a>.
</li><li> A variation takes place in the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">God has all of His animal friends enter an agreement to continuously reincarnate and stay together forever, so they can continue to have banquets and happy times. The cat is the only one to protest this, arguing that it's better to cherish the good memories they made while growing up and making new friends. None of the other animals wanted to hear this though, and as a result the cat was shunned in all of its reincarnated forms.</span> The state of the Sohma family by the time the story takes place shows that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the cat</span> was right, and everyone is only able to find peace when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the reincarnation cycle is broken for good</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, using a Philosopher's Stone to extend your life is portrayed as immoral. The process of creating the Philosopher's Stone <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">uses up human lives, <em>lots of them</em></span>.
<ul><li> Greed's ultimate goal is immortality, since, as he puts it, "They don't call me Greed for nothing. I want money. I want women, status, and power. I want everything this world's selling and eternity's topping the list!" It's both a means to achieving his other desires and an end in and of itself. While Al points out that Greed seems to <em>already</em> be immortal, Greed himself is aware that he has a finite (though large) number of resurrections available. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">What he really wants all that time was friends.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hohenheim</span> is granted immortality after he (unknowingly) helps <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Father</span> sacrifice <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire population of the nation of Xerxes</span> to create <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Father's body</span>.
</li><li> However, this is averted in the case of Ling and May, who are actively seeking the secrets to immortality, but are still presented as sympathetic characters. This is probably because they're not looking for it so they can use it themselves, but so they can give it to their emperor to help their clans. They've expressed worry that if the emperor knew it was possible to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sacrifice everyone in his country to extend his life</span> he <em>would</em>, meaning he is a potential example.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime version</a>, the main method of using the Philosopher's Stone to extend one's lifespan involved <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">stealing other people's bodies</a></span>. In fact, one of the major recurring themes in both the original series and the 2003 anime are the lengths people are willing to go through to achieve immortality.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Gunnm</a>: Last Order</em> has the citizens of the solar system essentially immortal through Phlebotinum - which means that uncontrolled reproduction is a massive crime and children are <em>lucky</em> to be treated as garbage.
</li><li> The Stone Masks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> can turn a human into an immortal vampire if they absorb enough blood/lifeforce. One character in particular (a former good guy even) was so desperate to avoid old age that he betrayed his allies so he could use their blood to activate one of the Masks. However, this immortality does not come with invincibility. Vampires can be killed for good by exposing them to sunlight or using the Ripple to turn the body's biological processes into a manifestation of the sun's energy.
<ul><li> The Stone Masks were originally created by a member of a vampiric species known as the Pillar Men who sought complete immortality and immunity to both the sun and the Ripple. His fellow Pillar Men realized he would be a danger to the whole world and tried to stop him, but he and a handful of his disciples eradicated his whole species. The only thing keeping him from perfect immortality was the Super Aja, a gemstone that perfectly concentrates sunlight. In the climax of the story arc where he is the antagonist, he gets the Super Aja and becomes a perfectly evolved life form that cannot die. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">Not that he doesn't get what's coming to him</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> As expected of a series that puts a lot of emphasis on the succession of the old generation by the new one, all cases of immortality in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> employs this trope. Orochimaru uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Grand Theft Me</a>, effectively killing someone every time he steals a new body. Kakuzu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stole his opponents' hearts to replace his old, failing ones</span> (though Kakuzu declines to think of it as immortality, being more of an <em>extended</em> lifespan than an indefinite one, and is likely more interested in the <em>power</em> that gives him than the immortality). Hidan's immortality is both very evil <em>and</em> very immortal, effectively being fueled by him killing people, though exactly how it works isn't explained in detail.
<ul><li> Sasori also considers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">transferring his heart into a puppet</span> a form of immortality. While he did not have to kill anyone to do it, it is partly a byproduct of his twisted views on human life (according to him, he can "make" people if he wants companionship by creating human puppets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">from the bodies of ninja</span>).
</li></ul></li><li> This could be thought of as one of the major themes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix">Phoenix</a></em> series. It's usually the antagonist of the volume that seeks the eponymous bird so that they can drink her blood and become immortal. The protagonists don't often agree with this, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">Who Wants to Live Forever?</a> Though it is worth stating that there are quite a bit of subversions as well, especially since the <em>protagonist</em> of one volume actually succeeds in become immortal.
</li><li> Keith White in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ProjectARMS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ProjectARMS">Project ARMS</a></em> wants to be an immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">god</a> and is willing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill everyone in America with a missile to do so. It ultimately is revealed that his plan would never work - the immortal alien lifeform Azrael would never help him destroy the planet because it had spent several billion years alone in space and wanted companionship</span>. The many clones of Huey Graham are also immortal to a degree (their conscious is backed on a computer, and thus can be reuploaded to any body), but all are shown to be emotionless. Their father ultimately decides that it is wrong to keep them that way and destroys their mental backup, shortly before they all die in an explosion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> portrays not so much the <em>pursuit</em> of immortality as universally bad, but the verification. Lina points out that the only way to be sure any method of immortality actually works is to apply it to somebody, then try to kill them by every means you can think of(Bleeding and asphyxiation don't work? How about[poison? Massive blunt trauma? Acid? Organ removal?). Sooner or later, you'll succeed, then it's back to the drawing board(and the next test subject). One entire kingdom fell into ruin after the king offered a massive reward to anyone who could grant him immortality. The resulting testing phases depopulated entire communities. While true immortality is implied to be impossible, two methods of achieving <em>partial</em> immortality do appear in the series: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">selling your soul to the Mazoku</a>, which is bad; or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">being cursed with ''Raugnut Rushavna''</a>, which is worse.
</li><li> This is one of the two reasons why the Humanization Ritual exists in the first place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes">3×3 Eyes</a></em>: according to Shiva during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Dream World arc</a>, the immortal Triclops who ages beyond a certain point slowly become more decadent, losing their morals and growing arrogant, distant and apathetic. He told a young Pai that he wanted to undergo the ritual because he felt he was losing his goodness like them. Indeed, the adult Sanzhiyan we see in his arc are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">laughing with contempt at the sight of lesser demons being executed and tortured.</a>

Palpatine. He has a bunch of clone bodies to put his soul into, coming as close as possible to the Sith dream of immortality, but the clones are shorter-lived every time. To that end, he decides to give Alderaan expatriates a home "in restitution for Tarkin's crimes" and drain their energies, and eventually the entire universe would face this fate. So Luke and a lost tribe of Jedi sabotage the process and Palpatine tries to take possession of Han and Leia's son (this being a desperate last-ditch Plan B when he's down to his last clone, since it would result in being trapped in a helpless child for years), leading to a good old-fashioned father-son team-up wherein Han kills Lord Sidious's body and Anakin (Leia named him.

<ul><li> Conversely, the eponymous Philosopher's Stone of the first book was held and used by Nicholas Flamel for centuries, with no suggestion that it was at all morally questionable. However, Flamel agreed to destroy the Stone to keep it out of Voldemort's hands (though it is also hinted that he and his wife were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">sick of immortality anyway</a>).
</li><li> Probably because the Flamels weren't so much "immortal" as "unaging". They could still have died through accident or deliberate violence, and there was always the option, which they take at the end, of ceasing to take the elixir that makes them not age. Voldemort's horcruxes mean that he will survive no matter what happens to him, as long as one is still intact. There is also the aforementioned "nauseating" procedure in making a horcrux, while the Stone seems to be a simple matter of harmless chemistry (or alchemy, given the setting).
<ul><li> It's implied, at least in the film, that Flamel would die in a <em>very</em> short time without the elixir. Dumbledore mentions that Flamel has enough elixir to put his affairs in order. This means that he wouldn't even survive a few months without the elixir.

</li></ul></li><li> The desire for immortality in itself isn't portrayed as immoral, since there are about fifteen immortals in the Belgariad (including Garion and various of his companions).

Each resurrection kills a living person however. It is possible to bind the spirit of one of these zombies back into its reanimated body, giving it a twisted kind of life. These beings, called <em>lazars</em>, are quite sapient and capable of repairing their own bodies to full strength and wield all the magical powers they did in life making them quite unkillable.

The standard method of life-extension is clearly immoral; it involves raising a clone to adulthood and then transplanting your brain into their body (killing them in the process).

Morgan</a>, cortical stack technology allows people to have their mind transferred to a new sleeve (body). A life insurance policy will have your stack downloaded to a new sleeve when you die. Doing it repeatedly will allow you to live forever. However, because of the expense most people can only afford to resleeve after working for their entire lives to save up for it, meaning you have to go through the pains of aging every time. In <em>Altered Carbon</em> it's explained that most people can only face going though the whole process a couple of times before giving up and accepting death, especially since it's worse the second time round because you already know what you have to look forward to. As a result, only those who are both very rich and have the right mental attitude can live for more than a couple of hundred years, and are nicknamed "Meths", short for Methuselahs. Meths tend to be amoral bastards:
<ol><li> because you have to be to reap enough success and wealth to fund repeated resleeving
</li><li> because you begin to view the lives of normal people to be short, miserable and therefore worthless in comparison.
</li><li> unless a Meth uses a cloned or artificial sleeve, it means they've bought the repossessed sleeve of a convict whose stack has been put on ice for the duration of their imprisonment and couldn't afford the storage costs. Once they're released, they have to put up with whatever wasted junkie body the government provides.

They're forced to hide out in the most secret of places and live a sort of half-life, constantly fearful of both justice and the coming time when they must steal another body or finally let old age catch up with them.

The focus of the novel is a 19th century <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who discovered an immortality formula, which unfortunately had to be taken regularly and required living human spinal cords as a key ingredient, turning the guy into a serial killer. However, even after the scientist developed a version of the formula which didn't require human bits, allowing him to stop killing, it's still explained by another character that the immortality formula is the most dangerous weapon ever developed; if the ingredients are rare and thus the potion expensive, it would lead to total social collapse as the poor would riot against the rich demanding equal access to it. If the ingredients are common and the potion easy to obtain, the human population would explode even more and the world would drown in billions of immortal losers, criminals, and other undesirables.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TideLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TideLords">Tide Lords</a></em>, the immortals are thousands of years old and <em>completely</em> unkillable. Even the nicest ones simply don't have any regard for human life, since from their perspective they were going to outlive them anyway.
</li><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov">Mikhail Akhmanov</a> and Christopher Nicholas Gilmore's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainFrenchOrTheQuestForParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainFrenchOrTheQuestForParadise">Captain French, or the Quest for Paradise</a></em>, where the titular protagonist lives in a universe where humanity has long ago discovered Cell Regeneration, a treatment that, once applied, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">stops aging dead in its tracks</a>. The protagonist is quick to point out that this doesn't stop people from dying, as, statistically speaking, most are likely to die in accidents, murders, wars, social upheavals, etc. At the same time, he himself is over 2000 years old, although due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDilation">Time Dilation</a> from his constant relativistic travels he is over 20,000 years old in planetbound time. The lack of aging doesn't make humans any more or less moral than they normally would be, if everybody else is just like them. Certain things are different, though, such as the concept of inheritance. There's an equal chance of a son dying before his father, so there's no expectation of your parents' possessions becoming yours anytime soon. Retirement is also out of the question, as the whole concept assumes you make enough money while you work to last you the rest of your life. If your life is potentially unending, you never make enough. Wars, man-made disasters, coups, etc., are still present. Overpopulation is present on many worlds, although it's resolved through child licenses and occasional colony ships to habitable worlds. The only people who grow old are criminals sentenced to aging and children of colonists on recently-settled worlds who haven't set up CR machines yet. A planet undergoes a period of religious fanaticism after a comet strike and a civilization collapses. Not only do they not consider immortality to be evil or immoral, they think it's God's gift to humanity and will not even deprive criminals of it (prefering to re-educate them through hard labor instead).

They record their memories on crystals that then get downloaded into new cloned bodies. As a society, they have done absolutely nothing for 3 million years, after conquering two other races and forcing them into servitude, along with the majority of their own race. When they discover humans rapidly expanding close to their hidden territory, and worse, that these young upstarts have weapons the Harammins can only dream of, they stage a surprise attack on human worlds, hoping to eliminate the threat in one fell swoop. The attack is repelled, revealing the Harammin hideout and resulting in the destruction of the Immortal Quota. Subverted with many humans who start using the mind-recording crystals to live on in virtual space after their deaths. Other examples exist, including cyborgs, virtualized minds, AIs, and mutants.

This, combined with the fact that Goa'uld memories are passed on in their DNA to future generations, is the cause of the species' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> nature. It's also why the rebel Tok'ra faction (descendants of the only known good Goa'uld, Egeria) refuse to use the sarcophagus, even at the cost of their own extinction. However, even the sarcophagus eventually fails, as it was in Yu's case. Conveniently, he was one of the most benevolent Goa'uld to become senile and close to death. It was not the issue with the host but with the symbiote.
</li><li> The immortality treatment offered by the title character of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> episode "Deathwalker" requires the death of some in order to make others immortal. Deathwalker hopes to cause the various races to degenerate into civil war as revenge for the destruction of her own people.
<ul><li> Ironically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her plans are foiled by the Vorlons, a race that has already reached true immortality, and apparently by less immoral means. (But then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">you never know for sure with those First Ones</a>.)</span>

Their leader explains it as the possibility of death made each second important, more so than it ever was before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted in season 3's "Time Is On My Side" with an immortal doctor who needs to replace his organs when they "wear out"; Sam steals his notebook, complete with the formula for how to become immortal. Turns out its <em>not</em> some dark magic ritual that involves drinking blood from a baby's skull, its just science — though "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">weird</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdScience">science</a>". The brothers eventually bury the notebook with the doctor, not wanting to have to prey on others to survive. It seems like they didn't stop to consider the positive implications of that kind of immortality paired with organ cloning technology...
</li><li> And subverted again in the season 5 episode "The Curious Case Of Dean Winchester", where the leads come across a witch who lengthens his life by playing Texas Hold'em with humans. At least 25 years of life is the buy-in: winning means you can regress to your younger self or not age for that amount of time, while losing means you age rapidly or die. There are no tricks involved, as the only ones who play the witch are those who search him out knowing full well what the game entails. Interestingly, the witch never cheats (he's been playing and winning so long, he doesn't feel the need to), tries to dissuade potential players whom he believes don't have a real shot at winning, and on one case, he folds a hand he's certain he'll win and voluntarily ends the game, just to give an aging opponent enough extra years of life for him to see his granddaughter's Bat Mitzvah. He's a pretty nice guy.

<ul><li> Yes and no. While it does partly stem from the idea that Immortals are somehow "abominations before God/nature" or some such drivel, there's also the very reasonable fear of what would happen if an Immortal actually does win the nebulous "Prize," and what kind of world-ruling power they may actually have. Especially any of the evil guest-star Immortals, Kern, Kanis, Kronos. . .

</li><li> The mysterious caller in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Forever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Forever">Forever</a></em> claims he has been around for over 2000 years and, over this time, has lost all compassion for humanity. He sees no problems with killing an innocent person just to get someone to notice him. In contrast, Henry cares a lot, although the caller claims it's because Henry is <em>only</em> 200 years old and hasn't yet become a cynic. Being a doctor probably helps, although Henry is currently working as a coroner.

What was done to her all those millennia ago is terrible (being unjustly punished for being raped), but it doesn't justify seducing attractive young men and then turning them to stone when they call her beautiful.

</li><li> In 4<sup>th</sup> edition, Liches get immortality through an evil ritual invoking Orcus, an evil demonic deity of the undead. However, more noble casters with enough effort can find an immortality ritual that forgoes calling upon the demonic forces to become Archliches. Generally, in 4th edition, most epic destinies can involve immortality through different means, almost all of which are good or neutral.
</li><li> 5E Liches eat souls to maintain their forms. Those that do not lose their bodies and revert to demiliches, floating skulls significantly weaker than full liches (unlike in previous editions where demiliches were advanced liches, who also ate souls and were floating heads but retained all spellcasting ability).
</li></ul></li><li> The Forgotten Realms also features magic that drains the life from others and adds it to your lifespan. Casting the spell <em>is</em> an inherently evil act, though careful users can avoid falling to Evil themselves through their choice of lifestyle and victims.
</li><li> <em>Eberron</em> also shifts undead from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> to <em>usually</em> evil. The most well-known vampire of the setting is the guy who ended the last 100 years of war, and he didn't even <em>want</em> immortality originally. Since the setting tends towards at least somewhat realistic politics he earns his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> alignment with his ruthless nature, but at least he's working towards relatively good ends.
</li><li> Immortality can also be cosmically illegal: creatures called Marut travel around the Planes, hunting down people who go too far to avoid dying when their time is up.
</li><li> Prior to 3E, Potions of Longevity were a regular part of every <em>D&amp;D</em> game edition. Each potion consumed could add a few decades to someone's lifespan, but had a small chance of causing their deferred age to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoImmortalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoImmortalInertia">instantly catch up with them</a> instead. So non-lichly longevity <em>was</em> available, without any moral baggage: it was just a gamble and didn't last long, relatively speaking.
</li><li> In BECMI D&amp;D, the <em>wish</em> spell could knock off 1d10 years of age, without any drawbacks. So once a magic-user hit the right power level, they had it made.

She uses children because it works best with them — they have more potential lifespan to drain.

The Old Ones and their servant races easily push the Nercontyr back to their home planet. In desperation the Necrons aligned themselves with the C'tan who not only want to eliminate the Old Ones, but also provide the Necrontyr mechanical bodies to make themselves immortal. The new power the Necrons have allowed them to purge the galaxy of almost all life, and the war lead to the extinction of the Old Ones. After the war the Necrons went into stasis and hope to awake when the Eldar Empire would fall, and they would take over the galaxy, instead they awoke in a galaxy where various races are fighting each other for supremacy, the Necrons strive to rebuild their old dynasties and eliminate all organic life in the galaxy. Though one Necron Lord actually wants to <em>preserve</em> organic life in the galaxy because he intends to use that biomass to give the Necrons flesh and blood bodies again.

She is revealed to be an ancient Elvhen Goddess or Evanuris, Mythal, who's Spirit survived and possessed a woman and that Spirit was, seemingly, passed down from mother to daughter. Flemeth also suggests that Morrigan was never in any danger and that she would have to accept the 'gift', again suggesting that Mythal is a Fade Spirit and matching the setting's terms of possession; the subject must consent. While Flemeth herself is mysterious and shady in her actions for most of the franchise; sending Morrigan with the Warden to collect the Old God's soul from the Archdemon, never being clear in her motives, threatening to take Morrigan's Son if he possesses the Old God soul, and other dubious choises, it seems most if not all of her actions are born out of a desire to preserve aspects of the magic in the world, and not out of genuine malice or ill-will. However, Inquisition does introduce another example...</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The two antagonists introduced in Inquisition do apply. The first is the game's Big Bad, Corypheous, who is one of the original Tevinter Magisters who breached the Golden City in the Fade (turning it black) and creating or releasing the Darkspawn upon the world... centuries ago. He is still alive as some kind of human-Darkspawn Hybrid like The Architect in Dragon Age: Awakening. He is freed from his Grey Warden prison during Dragon Age 2: Legacy and comes to believe that the word of the Maker and the Old Gods are nothing but lies.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Solas, also known as the Elvhen God, Fen'Harel. The Elvhen Gods are revealed to be no more than Elves who had extended their lives and power to impossible levels and considered most of the world and its people beneath them, keeping many as slaves. Solas became a Champion of the Elven people, freed slaves, and eventually sealed the Elven Gods, Evanuris, away by creating the Veil and separating the Fade and the mortal world. Solas went to sleep after this action drained him, woke up, and like Corypheus was horrified at the outcome of creating the Veil and began his quest to correct it, even if it meant that the world of Thedas would perish in the process. He tried to manipulate Coryphous into giving him more power, joined the Inquisitor to stop Corypheus when that didn't work, and then left for their own quest once Corypheus was defeated and Solas needed a new plan. He returns at the end of Inquisition's DLC, Trespasser, to explain some of his motives, save the Inquisitor from the Mark they had accidentally gotten from him at the start of Inquisition, and disappear off to complete his quest, setting himself up as the Big Bad for the eventually fourth game in the franchise.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> almost entirely averts this, most of the characters long-lived or even immortal in some way without any negative judgement towards them, however while it doesn't present immortality itself as a bad thing it can be bad if sought for selfish reasons:
<ul><li> Fujiwara no Mokou attained immortality by drinking the Hourai Elixir, which she obtained by killing the man who was on a mission from the Emperor to destroy it; she only wanted immortality in the first place to have an opportunity to enact revenge on Kaguya (who also drank the elixir and had recently returned to the moon, Mokou correctly fearing that a mortal human would be dead by the time she traveled to Earth again). When she finally did reunite with Kaguya the two spent the following <em>centuries</em> repeatedly killing each other. She is also notable for being the <em>only</em> member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">massive cast</a> to not be in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsAwesome">Living Forever Is Awesome</a> camp, the only human with any form of immortality and thus not fitting with either humans or youkai.
</li><li> Kaguya is this trope from the perspective of the other Lunarians who, though "naturally immortal", view the Hourai Elixir as being "impure" and banished Kaguya to Earth for its use (though not, interestingly, Eirin for creating it). This could be due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Lunarian immortality being the "never age or fall ill"</a> variety while Hourai immortality is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">"never ever die, ever"</a> variety.
</li><li> Remilia Scarlet is a bit of a grey area, as while she is a vampire who drinks blood from people to survive she always "leaves some on her plate" and doesn't actually kill anyone, so her bark is worse than her bite. On top of that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has it that Remilia will forever have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">physical appearance</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">of a child</a> because "creatures of her kind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalImmaturity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalImmaturity">forfeit their growth and maturity</a> in exchange for eternal life. In other words, she can live forever because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">never grows up</a>."
</li><li> <em>Ten Desires</em> introduces Miko and her followers, who followed Taoism solely to gain the immortality it provided and then exacerbated a religious war to ensure that everyone else in Japan would follow Buddhism, intending to use it to suppress the masses while they gained power through Taoism. Special mention goes to Seiga Kaku who was not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">the one who mentored</a> Miko and the others in the ways of Taoism but was also the one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">who adviced Miko to use Buddhism to pacify Japan</a> <em>on top</em> of also being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancer</a>.
</li><li> Learning to stop one's own aging is considered a natural if difficult goal for human mages. Alice Margatroid was fully human once (Patchouli Knowledge may have been as well). Their early characterization suggests that while it isn't precisely immoral, the sheer degree of obsessive study and focus required for a human to attain an indefinite lifespan this way (before dying of old age) may be itself unhealthy. As Marisa's trying for this herself, it remains to be seen if she'll be affected.
<ul><li> Marisa <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker">wants to become immortal</a>, but her options are limited because she refuses to indulge in any method that would fall under this trope. For example, she doesn't want to become a youkai magician like Alice because she wants to retain her humanity, and Hourai immortality is out because to get it, she'd have to "kill" a Hourai immortal like Kaguya or Mokou and eat their liver<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12fn0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12fn0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12fn0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Plus Hourai immortality is irreversible and Marisa wants the ability to give it up just in case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">she gets tired of it somewhere down the line</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em>Wild and Horned Hermit</em> though, where it's revealed that immortality <em>is</em> in fact a sin in the Touhou-verse, at least according to the Bureau of Right and Wrong. And since they're the ones in charge of sorting people out into Heaven or Hell or Whatever, they have the final say in these sorts of things. Specifically, Hell sends agents to hunt down and kill people who live too long, such as Seiga. Kasen muses on what this means for the naturally immortal youkai, but the question remains unanswered.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em> introduces Reaver, who sacrifices others to a triumverate of demons so that he can stay eternally young and beautiful.

The process involves giving up any possible empathy for other human beings.

</li><li> Immortals themselves (that is to say, a class of magical humanlike creatures who are naturally immortal), have another form of this trope, in that the older they get, the more unhinged and psychotic they become.

The Immortals are aware of this, and consciously decide to "die" every two hundred years or so in order to "reset" their personalities and avoid this fate. They retain some of their memories of past lives, but in the form of pure information, not as actual experiences they can remember. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pandora has been avoiding death for around six hundred years or so, and is very definitely insane by this point.

<ul><li> Some commentators, both religious and secular, argue that to "cure" aging would abolish a key part of the human experience. Perhaps the most notable exponent of this viewpoint is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Kass">Leon Kass<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, formerly of the President's Council on Bioethics.
<ul><li> While others, like <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, consider this to be us <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholming</a> Death. They think the quest to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">beat death</a> is the most <em>human</em> thing we could possibly do.
</li></ul></li><li> Presumably, if this were applied on a global scale, it would result in massive overpopulation (and thus, this trope is in full effect in Immanual Kant's system of moral philosophy, which says that you should not do something that would be bad if <em>everyone</em> did it). If only a few people were granted immortality, they would likely acquire disproportionate power and control over the course of their lives, and would never be removed from power by death. So, unless there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopulationControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopulationControl">Population Control</a>, completely effective contraception, and/or cheap, reliable space colonization becomes available, immortality could be very bad for the human race in general.
<ul><li> On an even larger scale, one could argue that immortality threatens all life on earth, via a lack of evolution. Eternally young but experienced creatures will almost always outcompete their own offspring. Thus, any immortal species will stop replacing its individuals with those from a newer generation. This stays true as the environment changes, while some of the young creatures will be slightly better adapted to it by chance, this advantage doesn't outweigh the massive gap in experience. This in turn means that those slightly better adapted individuals can't reproduce and produce (once more by chance) even better adapted ones. The gap between the environment the species has evolved in and the one it's currently living in will eventually become too big, and the immortal species goes extinct (barring magical means that let the animals survive literally anywhere). This could take as long as hundreds of millions of years though, in select cases, and it can be subverted altogether if the immortality is incomplete and enough immortal individuals still die from predator attacks or other causes. Still, this is one reason why we have the lifespan we have; evolution selects against populations with too long an average life. Then again not able to die is probably the ultimate adaptation.
</li><li> The one positive benefit of racial immortality is that it makes space exploration by traveling slower than the speed of light an attractive prospect without using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationShips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationShips">Generation Ships</a>. Living forever would work just fine, so long as humanity adopted an extreme expansionist policy.
</li></ul></li><li> For a given definition of immortality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">people who commit horrible crimes just to get featured on the news so they can live on in infamy forever would count.</a>
<ul><li> Including, not least of which (nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">most recently</a>) <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herostratus">Herostratus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Notably, even back then, the authorities tried to deny him his goal by trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">Unperson</a> him (they made it a crime to mention his name on pain of death). Unfortunately, their efforts were ultimately in vain.
</li><li> Law enforcement agencies and some media outlets have increasingly become aware of this and are starting to make conscious efforts to avoid it. For example, most outlets poignantly refused to air the name of the man responsible for committing a mass shooting at a church in a small town in Texas in late 2017.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethBathory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethBathory">Elizabeth Báthory</a></em> supposedly drank and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath">bathed</a> in the blood of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower">virgins,</a> thinking it would make her immortal.
