</p><p>Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">the practical reason for this trope</a> is that it is easier (and more realistic) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty">cast Morgan Freeman as God</a> than it is to figure out what God really looks like.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>: Multiple:
<ul><li> In <em>The End of Evangelion</em>, there are millions of supernatural Rei clones that, as a part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Instrumentality</a>, take the shape of a person's loved one or a close friend, and then hug them. It's a trap to make the humans lower their ATF and allow the clones to touch and remove their soul, reverting humanity into souls and LCL. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Or, if the person is too scared/doesn't believe that it really is their loved one, just goes ahead and turns them into LCL by force.</a>
</li><li> Aoba, however, experienced only a multitude of naked Reis, implying there was no-one he truly loved.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>, the demon summoned aboard the Advenna Avis has taken to adopting a human form (which can be recognized as one of the supporting Camorra gangsters, Ronnie Sukiart). His true form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">is never shown in the anime</a>, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels">Light Novels</a> imply that it's rather disturbing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>
<ul><li> This shows up in <em>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</em>, since the Data Overmind is of an existence completely alien to physical humanity, yet wants to discover what makes the title character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">able to do what she does</a>; it has constructed humanoid Agents who can observe and interact. These Agents are partially their own being, partially of the Overmind. How exactly individual Yuki is in comparison to the Overmind is a common theme in the series.
</li><li> However, definitely of this trope is Kuyou Suou, an agent of the competing faction the "Sky Canopy Domain". She has no individuality at all (at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">according to Kyon</a>); she's entirely a humanlike mouthpiece for the Domain. This doesn't quite make Kyon feel more comfortable, though, because Kuyou's horrible social skills (being unable to even <em>talk</em> coherently or look normal/visible) make the plan for them a failure in that respect.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, Alucard, due to the thousands of souls inside him causing a lack of a definite gender, can change his appearance at will. To quote the man himself, "Form means nothing to me."
</li><li> The President in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WishUponThePleiades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WishUponThePleiades">Wish Upon the Pleiades</a></em> does this, being actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">energy being</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">wolves</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em> spend most of their time as humans, even when they should be in wolf form (for example, when humans are nowhere to be seen, or when they ate a dead deer). Presumably this was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman">Most Animators Are Human</a> and it was just easier to have their human forms be on screen. This is most likely a device to reinforce the fact that the "human form" seen by the world and the viewer is really an illusion. Very often, when the plot doesn't force the viewer to see them in a specific way (as people in the presence of people, for example), the viewer sees them switch back and forth: often very quickly from cut to cut.
</li><li> Sebastian of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> is strongly implied to have no form he's truly comfortable with, not even his own demon form, and simply chooses this human form for the sake of Ciel. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">That, or Sebastian just likes the clothes.</a>
</li><li> In <em>The Visitor</em>, a one-shot manga by Kanno Miyamoto, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Shinigami</a> explains that when visiting humans, he takes a form that would be comforting to that person. When he checks a file and sees that the dying man is gay, he notes: "That explains why I appeared as a man." So in this version, the Shinigami apparently have no control over which form they initially take.
</li><li> Cerberus/Kero and Yue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a>/Cardcaptors</em>. At first, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize">sleep mode</a> as a stuffed animal and ordinary human, but even after recovering their true forms, they don't use them much. Probably because a large flying lion with some kind of helmet and a rather scary blueish angel would freak people out. The main cast, however, doesn't care. It serves a practical function as well, particularly in the case of Yue. Their true forms constantly emit magic (since both are the products of magic), which becomes dangerous if prolonged. This becomes a plot point in the "Sakura Cards" arc when a magic field prevents both of them from returning to their "borrowed forms" and Sakura has to come up with a solution.
</li><li> Technically, Envy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> would count. He is a shapeshifter, and... well, his true form isn't exactly beautiful. Although in his case, it's because he is envious of humans, rather than wanting them to be comfortable. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">Truth</a> takes this trope a step beyond: it wears YOUR body parts. So... a form you are <em>un</em>comfortable with?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">Youkai</a> of a particularly high level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine">can turn into a completely human form</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">It also makes it easier to wield a sword.</a>
</li><li> Shinigami in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> is in appearance a Lighter and Softer version of your classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper">Grim Reaper-type</a> being. He states at one point he took on this look (and associated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> persona) in order to recruit children to his school, as his true form kept scaring them away. Thus he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper">Don't Fear the Reaper</a>. When he loses said persona, it is an indication that he's either truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">angry</a> or simply tired of his staff mucking around.
<ul><li> Kid's human appearance could be seen as Shinigami deliberately invoking this trope, as it's a long time before Kid's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">nature</a> becomes apparent, and by the time it does, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> don't care, they just see him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">friend</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Holo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em> is a wolf deity, and over 500 years old, but takes the form of a young girl. She says that the human guise isn't uncomfortable, but her real reason is because she's afraid of frightening off Lawrence. This very nearly happens anyway, as Holo is forced to turn wolf to protect an injured Lawrence. Lawrence reacts badly to being approached by a giant wolf, which in turn only alienates Holo further. Lawrence comes to his senses quickly, though, and manages to salvage the relationship. From then on, Lawrence seems comfortable with both forms, having learned that Holo is the same regardless of appearance.
</li><li> It's predictable that demons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> are actually monstrous, but it's revealed at the same time that even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend">Belldandy</a> isn't as human as she normally appears. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">Keiichi decides he doesn't care.</a>
<ul><li> To be fair, he's only seen one demon's true form, which causes him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">nearly lose his mind seeing it</a>, and it did make him consider what Belldandy actually looked like. It also appears that gods and demons don't have too much control over how they look, considering that Skuld is stuck looking like a kid, much to her chagrin. Apparently the forms that gods and demons appear in to humans are a 3-dimensional translation of their true 10-dimensional bodies.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the reason why the Scab Coral created human form Coralians to interact with humanity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em>.
</li><li> The Lord of Nightmares from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> can pick any form she wants, being god and all. She prefers to appear as a slender blonde woman, though... at least, when she's not inside someone else's body.
<ul><li> This is also the standard skill for Gold Dragons (Filia, however, isn't very adept with it, with frequent tail-related <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure">Glamour Failures</a>). Among the Mazoku, however, only the truly powerful can convincingly take human forms; middle-level Mazoku like Kanzel and Mazenda tend to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Red Right Hands</a>.

Apparently, their true form would shatter reality. This doesn't stop Gekkou from talking down to them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan">Haiyore!

<ul><li> This may be a case of A Form <strong>They</strong> Are Comfortable With, since in <em>Nyarko-San</em> most of the aliens are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">big fans</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable">of human pop culture</a>, and flashbacks show that characters like Nyarko seem to use their human form as their default even in situations where they wouldn't have to, and even characters who don't care about humans (like Nyarko's older brother Nyar-O) take on human form when on Earth.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with Heartseed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KokoroConnect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KokoroConnect">Kokoro Connect</a></em>. He often takes over their teacher and club advisor, Ryuzen Goto, when he wants to speak to them. While Goto-sensei is indeed a laid back and nice guy, in Heartseed-mode, he appears rather creepy due to making the guy looked drugged out, and speaking to them with a monotone voice. It also doesn't help that when several of the characters attempt to attack him, he can casually block, counter, or evade their attacks.
</li><li> Izanami, ruler of the underworld in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamisamaKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamisamaKiss">Kamisama Kiss</a></em>, takes the form of Nanami's rival Kayako when she appears before her since Izanami's own form rotted away long ago.
</li><li> Orochimaru, a major antagonist from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, reveals to his former sensei, the Third Hokage, that he has been using a technique called <em>Living Corpse Reincarnation</em> to transfer his soul into a different body once every three years. As expected, the Third Hokage is horrified by this revelation when Orochimaru shows him the true face of his host's body which comes off as completely unfamiliar to him.
</li><li> Backfires on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePirateMito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePirateMito">Space Pirate Mito</a></em>, a small childlike alien who uses a high tech <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileSuitHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileSuitHuman">"Mail Suit"</a> (AKA the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">"mom suit"</a>) to look like an adult human woman. She tries to re-use the suit after accidentally revealing her true form to her half-human son Aoi hoping it will convince him to call her "Mom" again, but now that he knows the truth Aoi finds the suit even more disturbing than her true form.

</li><li> Whoever sees Izanami in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Noragami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Noragami">Noragami</a></em> sees her in the appearance of someone who they are most comfortable with. For Yato, it was Hiyori. For Ebisu, it was the old woman who owned his favourite restaurant.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GlitterForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GlitterForce">Glitter Force</a></em> featured the Cures visiting Märchenland for the first time. In order to not spook its citizens, Pop uses his magic to turn the girls into fairies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IAmAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IAmAHero">I Am a Hero</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the zombie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> chooses to present itself this way for those who enter it but are still aware that they exist as individuals</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCLProgressive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCLProgressive">FLCL Progressive</a></em> reveals that this is true of Haruko Haruhara, as she takes on a much more disturbing form to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> devour Jinyu</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, this is often the case with most Zoan users and even some Logia users where they often stay in their human forms, hybrid forms, or even full animal forms in very few cases. They always take their respective forms when fighting but these users are the ones that take their forms almost every day.
<ul><li> The best example is Tony Tony Chopper who is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi that allows him to become a reindeer/human hybrid. Chopper has many forms called Points that he often takes at different points such as Walk Point and Heavy Point but his default form is Brain Point where he stands on two feet and is a lot smarter. Chopper is a rare case of an animal becoming a human instead of the other way around.
</li><li> Marine Vice Admiral Dalmatian is always seen in his hybrid dalmatian form instead of his full human form.
</li><li> The Jailer Beasts of Impel Down are this as well. They're Awakened Zoan Devil Fruit users where they recover from damage much quicker than others. They're also always seen in their hybrid forms.
</li><li> Ceaser Clown is, so far, the only Logia example of this. Ceaser often stays in his gaseous form which does help considering he can't be hit normally and can fly/float around.
</li></ul></li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DidntISayToMakeMyAbilitiesAverageInTheNextLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DidntISayToMakeMyAbilitiesAverageInTheNextLife">Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?</a></em> plays with this for "Nano", the physical representation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedTechnology">nanomachines</a> that enact this fantasy world's pseudo-magic. When they originally appear to Mile, she complains that they look scary, like a swarm of metal bees. They change into a shimmering vaguely-humanoid metallic shape, which reminds Mile too much of the bad guy from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2</a>. She asks them to take a cute form, but they have trouble with the concept, and she ends up having them change forms over a hundred times (offscreen) before settling on something that looks like a cross between Pikachu and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Kerberos/Kero</a>.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Happens all the time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> series.
<ul><li> When done by Dream:
<ul><li> When appearing to his lover Nada, Morpheus himself takes on the form of a tall, African man covered in tribal markings. He did a very smooth statuesque thing with Augustus Caesar, and got mistaken for Apollo, about which he was rather snippy. Morpheus and the other Endless have a different appearance to each person that looks at them (the one we see seems to be the default British/American Caucasian version, though the art style shifts all the time because different artists came in for different chapters).
<div class="indent"><strong>Marco Polo:</strong> Are you always so pale? <br/><strong>Dream:</strong> That depends on who's watching.
</div></li><li> Dream also appears as a black cat to cats, black fox for foxes, and a blackened face inside a fire vortex to the Martian Manhunter. The conceit is that people see the Endless as being either like themselves or like what they expect.
</li><li> Dream seems to go back and forth with this: half the time he wears period clothing, but he sometimes shows up in the human world wearing ridiculous capes and things, which have drawn comments from humans who run into him. John Constantine complained about the Robe of Flames being embarrassing, so he put on a black trench coat. John then complained about no sense of humor.
</li><li> This trope was also explicitly mentioned by caliph Harun al-Rashid when he tries to summon Dream and demands that the lord of dreams shows himself to the caliph in a form Harun will be comfortable with.
</li></ul></li><li> When done by others:
<ul><li> During the <em>Season Of Mists</em> storyline, Lord Kilderkin of Order manifests himself as the supreme icon of order — an empty cardboard box.
</li><li> Likewise, the Chaos Lord called Shivering Jemmy of the Nightmare Brigade manifests as a three-year-old girl, complete with a balloon and a love of ice cream.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jemmy:</strong> Nobody <em>clever</em> bes boxes!
</div></li><li> Gilbert, a rotund and helpful middle-aged man, was a manifestation of Fiddler's Green, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">intelligent place</a> that inhabited the dream realm. Also, he looks and sounds very much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>.
</li><li> Cain And Abel also qualify. It's heavily implied in <em>A Parliament of Rooks</em> that they weren't the first <em>human</em> murderer and victim, but in fact the first murderer and victim in the entire history of the universe and their true forms are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">Starfish Aliens</a>. Also, they aren't really related to Eve, who may or may not have ever been a real person to begin with, let alone whether or not she was really human.
</li><li> Invoked when Delirium actually mistakes a goth-dressed (lesbian) human for her sister Death in the beginning of <em>Brief Lives</em>. (It's unlikely any of the other Endless would mistake a human for one of their own, but Delirium and reality are not always on speaking terms.)
</li><li> Lampshaded when Orpheus pays an unexpected visit to Death in <em>Fables And Reflections,</em> catching her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth">dressed down.</a> She changes her twentieth century apartment, complete with a teddy bear, a fish-bowl and discarded stockings, to something with lots of stone columns and eternal gloom, and her own T-shirt and jeans attire to a black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousPeriodDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousPeriodDress">Gorgeous Period Dress</a> and a veil.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em> comics God appeared to Elaine in the form of her loved ones at first, and when Elaine told him to be someone she didn't know chose to appear as an elderly British gentleman in a bowler hat. He appears content to stay in this form for the rest of the comic after that, something Lucifer comments upon.
</li><li> The "out of continuity but very much inspired" <em>Murder Mysteries</em> had God disguised as a strange wingless angel, which the protagonist comments had eyes that seemed to contain more than the others as one of the first hints to his real identity. Oddly enough, once revealed as being God himself, he is never shown in panel, despite no evidence of any transformation taking place.
</li><li> The entire <em>Sandman</em> universe could be said to be this in meta form, hence why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthIsTheCenterOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthIsTheCenterOfTheUniverse">Earth Is the Center of the Universe</a> and we never see any stories that interact with alien life.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">ShapeShifter</a> extraordinaire, avoids using his "true" Martian appearance to avoid frightening people.
</li><li> Miss Martian, similarly, goes for cute green-skinned humanoid because because her original form makes J'onn's Martian appearance look like a cute cuddly teddy bear in comparison.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> "higher plane of existence" beings look humanoid to us, but that's just our filter. Most of them "wear" temporary bodies when visiting the material universe, made to order for them by a being called Antropomorpho. Despite this trope, they're almost always shown in the same individual forms.
<ul><li> Galactus, however, doesn't have such a temporary body. Instead, his own form looks different to different viewers; for instance, a Skrull sees him as Skrull-like. (Galactus's original form as a mortal being in the universe preceding our own, however, was indeed humanoid.) One issue featured a scene where humans and dozens of aliens gazed upon him at once, the frame was filled with smaller images representing what each of them saw him as. Galactus's range isn't limited to the humanoid; Squirrel Girl's squirrel companion Tippy-Toe confirmed that Galactus looks like "a regular guy" — by her standards, that is; he's momentarily drawn as a five-hundred-foot-long squirrel.
</li><li> God him/her/it/none-of-the-above-self appears to the Fantastic Four as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>. Or <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>. It's not clear.
<ul><li> Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four and several other characters in Marvel, so to them, Jack Kirby IS God. And since he did the same for several characters over at DC, so perhaps over there he is also God.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em>Adam: The Legend of the Blue Marvel</em>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWatcher">The Watcher</a> turns into a black man in order to talk to the title character. Humorously, the Watcher only did so because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind">he misinterpreted Blue Marvel's joke</a> about finding a white man on the moon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a></em>
<ul><li> Inverted intentionally by his foe Shuma-Gorath, who invades dimensions in whatever form will terrify the inhabitants most. On Earth, he appears as a single glaring eyeball surrounded by tentacles.
</li><li> Played straight with the Vishanti, who take vaguely human or animal visages to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">terrifying their worshipers</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One time-travel adventure for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomStrong">Tom Strong</a> sees him encounter one his recurring enemies, The Pangean, who generally takes the form of a giant slime mold (who at this point, is roughly the size of a small country). Reasoning that Tom would rather speak to a biped, he splits off a part of his biomass, forming it into a shape resembling a green man wearing 17th century style clothing so that they can communicate more easily.
</li><li> Implied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheManOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheManOfTomorrow">Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?</a></em> as the reason for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatGazoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatGazoo">fifth-dimensional trickster</a> Mr. Mxyzptlk's usual form as a little man in a purple suit, when he mocks the characters for thinking that's what he actually looks like. Narrating the story years later, Lois Lane describes being confronted with his true, hyper-spatial form: "I can't describe what Mxyzptlk then became. He had height, width, depth... and a couple of other things". Within the comic, he's drawn as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">gigantic energy being</a>.
</li><li> Lampshaded and justified by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrossGen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrossGen">CrossGen</a> when Ilhan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Meridian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Meridian">Meridian</a></em> visits Ingra of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFirst">The First</a></em>.

</li><li> Variation: In <em>Proposition Player</em>, Bill the Angel of The Lord claims he uses that name because were he to speak his <em>real</em> name, the sky would rupture, the oceans turn to blood, a thousand virgins die, etc., etc. Given that he's a bully and leg-breaker for the forces of Heaven, it's not certain whether he's sincere or just being an egocentric jerk.
</li><li> In one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fantomas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fantomas">Fantômas</a></em>, the thief/hero tries to steal a unique duck-billed dog. It turned out to be an alien sent to Earth to study humanity, who <em>tried</em> to take the form of a dog to go unnoticed, but something went wrong with the process. At the end of the story it changes into an eagle instead, this time more successfully.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> continuity, the Kree aren't the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAliens">Humanoid Aliens</a> of the regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, but are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">Starfish Aliens</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers">Powers</a></em>, the aliens who direct the Millennium Corps appear to Walker in human forms, most commonly those of Zora and Retro Girl. A subversion in that Walker has made it clear that he is <em>not</em> comfortable with them taking on the shapes of his dead friends and lovers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em>; John's original dealing with his long-term enemy Nergal dealt with this.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, Xavin deliberately shapeshifts into the form of a human teenage boy when he first meets Karolina, believing that it's something that she'd be comfortable with. When she's shocked by his appearance, s/he figures that her parents prepped her for him/her arriving in his/her natural Skrull form (really, she's surprised at the fact that her parents promised her hand in marriage to him/her.) When Karolina reveals that she's a lesbian, Xavin takes the form of a human teenage woman, a form which s/he stays in most of the time when around Karolina. For the few times when Xavin thinks it's more helpful to be in a male form, Karolina does not interact romantically with him/her ("If you were a girl right now, I'd kiss you.")
<ul><li> Inverted during the "Dead End Kids" arc, where Xavin assumes a white male form for most of the team's stay in 1900s New York, as s/he assumes that she'll experience less problems that way. Karolina comes <em>this</em> close to dumping her over it.

Onyxia uses three separate forms over the course of the story: Katrana Prestor, a more draconic version of Katrana resembling Alexstrasza's humanoid form, and a blonde bombshell. The last is used around anyone who doesn't know her true identity.

<ul><li> The situational variant of this is used in the first movie. David Bowman travels through the Star Gate, which we presume is even more mind-blowing in the flesh, so to speak, and ends up... in a hotel room. Not only that: in the novel, Dave notices that it's a bad rendition of a hotel room. It might look okay on the surface, but he quickly finds out that he can't open any drawers, the books are painted on the bookcase and all food and drink containers, such as cereal box and beer cans, are filled with some spicy, blue stuff that smells like macaroons. It's as if someone was trying to imitate a hotel room without understanding it. He finally finds out why when he turns on the TV and sees the same room in an old soap opera on the screen. The aliens had based the room on what they had learned from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable">various earth broadcasts</a>. But then again, it is the result of the trope being played as straight as possible. It never was the idea that Dave should take residence in the room; its function was merely to calm him by placing him in a familiar environment, in order to prepare him for his transformation into the Star Child.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandTenTheYearWeMakeContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandTenTheYearWeMakeContact">2010: The Year We Make Contact</a></em>, Dave, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascended to a higher plane of existence</a> in <em>2001</em>, creates a holographic image of himself as a human in order to communicate with Dr. Heywood Floyd aboard the <em>Discovery</em>. The film version is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>, as he changes appearance randomly throughout the encounter; this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">explained in the novel</a> as Bowman having trouble remembering being human.
</li><li> The Monoliths themselves are often described as having a dimensional ratio of 1:4:9 (1, 2, and 3 multiplied by themselves). Dave Bowman heavily implies that the progression continues into dimensions that humans cannot perceive, and also that every Monolith encountered is actually the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">same</a></em> one, and that despite appearing from several feet to several miles in length, it has only one size, "as large as necessary".
</li></ul></li><li> It is revealed that the chairman of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdjustmentBureau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdjustmentBureau">The Adjustment Bureau</a></em> has met with every single living person at some point in their lives, each time with a different look and gender.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em>, it's the <em>humans</em> who take on the form of <em>aliens</em> in an attempt to begin diplomatic negotiations with them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">while they plan to destroy the planet</a>. Inverting this trope was the main thrust of Cameron's original script, in which the Na'vi are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">Starfish Aliens</a>. (Sully still falls in love with a Na'vi in his Avatar form.) The avatars are still different from the Na'vi, being Na'vi/human hybrids. They have smaller eyes and ten fingers and ten toes (the Na'vi have eight of each). Presumably, this is because a human wouldn't know how to function with only four fingers on each hand. Though they seem to have no problem getting used to the tail...
</li><li> Used up to a point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlessTheChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlessTheChild">Bless the Child</a></em>, where most of the demons and angels look like regular people until the climax of the movie.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty">Bruce Almighty</a></em> and its sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvanAlmighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvanAlmighty">Evan Almighty</a></em>, God first appears as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">janitor</a>, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MorganFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MorganFreeman">Morgan Freeman</a>.
</li><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contact">Contact</a></em> takes the form of Eleanore Arroway's dead father in order to be able to talk to her. The Caribbean beach upon which they hold said conversation is also an example of this trope. Everything she saw outside the capsule after entering the second wormhole was previously shown in the film, implying that she was in some kind of VR from that point until she was returned. The alien's "unfocused" form implies that it's a tall Gray Alien, similar to the one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></em>.
</li><li> In the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthStoodStill2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayTheEarthStoodStill2008">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a></em>, Klaatu says that his true form would "only frighten [humans]".
</li><li> This trope is the entire point of the Metatron's existence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em>.
<div class="indent">"Human beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstand the awesome power of God's true voice. Were you to hear it, your mind would cave in and your heart would explode within your chest. We went through five Adams before we figured that one out."
</div><ul><li> And this turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">important to the finale</a>.
</li><li> God also does this, spending most of the movie in the form of a middle-aged homeless man in a coma, and at the end appearing as Alanis Morissette.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope was weaponized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamcatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamcatcher">Dreamcatcher</a></em>. The true form of the aliens is a massive, tripodal creature that can devour humans; knowing that this form will instigate aggressive reactions, they project a telepathic image of the traditional Gray alien into human minds, making them appear weak and near-human.
</li><li> Gozer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">Ghostbusters (1984)</a></em> first takes the aspect of a female human, then an aspect of the Ghostbusters' choosing.
<div class="indent"><strong>Winston:</strong> I thought Gozer was a man. <br/><strong>Egon:</strong> It's whatever it wants to be.

The aliens can copy human form; naturally this only serves to freak out those humans they're trying to reassure about their peaceful intentions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrDestiny">Mr. Destiny</a></em>, Fate itself manifests to Jim Belushi as a bartender who looks a lot like Michael Caine.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OhGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OhGod">Oh, God!</a></em>, God specifically tells Jerry Landers that he could have appeared in any other form, but chose one that Jerry could understand. God does the same thing in the two sequels. And both times, he looked like George Burns. So did The Devil. Which stands to reason, since God specifically tells the protagonist, who just thought the Devil was trying to trick him, that Harry O. Tophet (H.O.T., get it?) always wants to look like and sound like him.
</li><li> The fairies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PansLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PansLabyrinth">Pan's Labyrinth</a></em> at first appear more like overgrown grasshoppers but when Ofelia shows them pictures of the fairies in her storybook, they transform into them to please her.
</li><li> The recent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">movie adaptation</a> has Hades, whose style resembles Mick Jagger's. When Percy, Annabeth and Grover are a little bit surprised by his appearance, he shows them his true form — a big, talking flame — and changes right back. His looks aren't discussed any further. The humanoid version is implied to be closer to his true form — the flaming-demon-shape was just a form he picked to make them uncomfortable.
</li><li> Similar to the example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamcatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamcatcher">Dreamcatcher</a></em>, the aliens in <em>Progeny</em> project the Gray form to make the abduction ordeal more comfortable for humans. Their real form, as revealed part-way through the movie, is horrific, non-humanoid, and vaguely reptilian.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Purgatory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Purgatory">Purgatory</a></em>, the Indian and coach driver are actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">angels</span>.
</li><li> Likely in an homage to this trope's use in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, the Thermians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest">Galaxy Quest</a></em> disguise themselves as humans when visiting Earth. Their native form looks more like a mollusk than a human. In one scene, the Thermians forget to put on their disguises when visiting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a>'s stars — causing the latter to be quite disturbed.... They also keep up the disguises when no humans are around, because their slavish devotion to the <em>Galaxy Quest</em> "historical documents" made them build the ship <em>exactly</em> as they saw it — i.e., with controls designed for human beings. In their true forms, they can't use their own ship!
</li><li> <em>Santo vs. la Invasion de los Marcianos</em> (<em>Santo vs. the Martian Invasion</em>): The Martians are human-shaped to start with, but decide to run themselves through a transformation machine to get more human bodies. This meant they wouldn't have access to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Ray</a> Third Eye while in human form ... but that's good, because now the scriptwriters don't have to try explaining why Santo doesn't get vaporized when he goes mano-a-mano with them. Being able to ditch the long blond wigs probably made life easier for the wrestlers playing Martians.
</li><li> The title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Starman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Starman">Starman</a></em> takes the form of Jenny Hayden's recently deceased husband for exactly this reason.

Most of the time, he appears to the Animorphs (and Elfangor, in the 80s) as an adult male, or a wrinkly elf-like creature (as seen on the cover of <em>The Ellimist Chronicles</em>). At the end of <em>The Andalite Chronicles</em>, Elfangor sees the Ellimist as he truly is: "An indescribable being of light and time and space."
</li><li> When the Ellimist appears to Tobias in <em>The Change</em>, he appears as a mixture of birds. "I saw it flying toward me. It was a bird of prey. A raptor. Some undefinable shape, part falcon, part eagle, part hawk. It had a snow-white belly and reddish-brown back and a tail that spread to show a dusky rainbow of colors." <br/>When Tobias comments that this wasn't how the Ellimist looked the last time the Animorphs saw him, the Ellimist says that he chose a shape Tobias would identify with.
</li><li> The Ellimist tends to prefer this even when it's not necessary; in his confrontation with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Crayak</a> at the end of <em>The Ellimist Chronicles</em>, he chooses to take the form of an ordinary Ketran (the species he originally belonged to).

Notably in "Buy Jupiter", where aliens who inhabited the coronas of stars (and thus existed at temperatures in the thousands of degrees) interacted with humans by projecting human forms to Earth.

<ul><li> Subverted by Aphrael. Although she is a goddess, she chooses to appear as a barefoot little girl — not so much for the comfort of the humans with whom she interacts, but for her <em>own</em>. She likes to be cuddled and kissed and treated like a little princess, so she adopts the form that is virtually guaranteed to win her such treatment. Her true form isn't that difficult to get around — a gorgeous, pale, nude young woman. Who glows. And flies. And is a source of magic. And can destroy you with a thought, if she feels like it. The only reason Sparhawk isn't comfortable with her true form is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleasePutSomeClothesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleasePutSomeClothesOn">her nudity goes against his gentlemanly propriety</a>.
<ul><li> Also, by the time he first sees her true form she's already assumed a new disguise form as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his daughter</span>, so naturally seeing her as a beautiful naked woman is a little off-putting.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em>The Tamuli</em> trilogy with Xanetia. The most skilled of the Delphae, when she ventures outside her city, she alters her natural light emission to make herself look like an ordinary Tamul. This is not so much for the comfort of the heroes who are by this point used to the idea but rather for the general public since the general reaction to seeing a Delphae (better known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhosphorEssence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhosphorEssence">Shining Ones</a>) is to run in terror.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld">Everworld</a></em>
<ul><li> Senna has her astrally-projected form take the form of a military-looking man when communicating with her followers, wisely suspecting they would find that more authoritative than a pretty sixteen-year-old girl. When she actually brings them to Everworld she eventually creates the illusion of herself as a pseudo-Valkyrie for the same reason.
</li><li> Dionysus also admits that the gods (at least the Olympians) do this, taking whatever form they feel suits their particular profession; he, for example, goes for a more "approachable" look since he enjoys mortal company. When Christopher questions why Artemis (goddess of virgins) would choose to look attractive, Dionysus replies that a pledge of eternal chastity wouldn't be worth as much if men didn't <em>want</em> to have sex with her.
<ul><li> Zeus is so overwhelming that seeing him will kill a mortal (referencing the Semele myth). He talks with mortals by first taking some other form (first an eagle, later a bull) and slowly easing himself into a more humanoid appearance. April notes that she has to look away as he does this, since looking for too long feels like staring into the sun.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flatland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flatland">Flatland</a>: A Romance of Three Dimensions</em>, features an interesting variation of this trope. As the Square passes through Lineland, the king of Lineland can only perceive the Square as another Line. When a Solid passes through the plane of Flatland, the Square can only perceive the Solid as another Shape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI">Garrett, P.I.</a></em>
<ul><li> In Glen Cook's book <em>Petty Pewter Gods</em>, it turns out that practically all of the gods of the various pantheons are actually refugees from another dimension that feed on faith. Their true form seems to look something like a giant glowing sea anemone — or at least, that's the form of something that tries to break free and into the real world.
</li><li> In <em>Cruel Zinc Melodies</em>, a mysterious presence <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that's really a miles-long sentient fungal mass</span> under the World Theater's construction-site sends a projected image of Eleanor to communicate with Garrett.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Ghostmaker</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an Eldar Farseer</span> requires the aid of Rawne's Ghosts to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">defend a lost webway gate</span>, but doesn't want the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eldar</span> presence to be known to them. So, he uses his psychic abilities to produce a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">sort-of Lotus Eater effect</a>, making them believe that they're on Tanith fighting alongside other Guardsmen against the forces of Chaos, when in reality, they're fighting through the ruin and the Guardsmen they're fighting alongside are actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dire Avengers</span>. The masquerade isn't very convincing and it's eventually broken by the Ghosts themselves.
</li><li> Played with in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeHaldeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeHaldeman">Joe Haldeman</a>'s short story "A Time to Live", when the protagonist is talking to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Alien</a>.
<div class="indent">I asked him why he didn't show me his true form. I am too old to be afraid of bogeymen. He did change into his true form and I asked that he change back into one of the others. I had to know which end to talk to.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></em>,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after being "killed" by Voldemort, Harry finds himself in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterlifeAntechamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterlifeAntechamber">Afterlife Antechamber</a> that looks like King's Cross Station. Dumbledore, who meets him there, is a bit surprised by the description, but says it's what he can cope with. When Harry asks if he has to go back, Dumbledore extends the metaphor: he could, if he wished, metaphorically catch a train. "Where would it take me?" "On."</span>
<ul><li> Another possible interpretation of that scene is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dumbledore himself is actually Death, in a form Harry would trust as advisor.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">angels</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em> have a true form which is apparently something like architecture, but humans and <em>panserbjørne</em> (and others) see them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a> because their mind just can't wrap itself around their true forms. Technically, the angels aren't even taking this form, the mind of the observer just interprets them as looking like angels. This even applies to witches, who have much more expanded minds than other races and were aware of things like parallel universes long before them.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus">Illuminatus!</a></em> trilogy, an entity presumed to be the Devil manifests at the climax of a memorable Black Mass. The defrocked priest (defrocked for detrousering altar boys) Padre Pederastia, screams <em>Come not in that form!</em> as the entity begins to appear. Bidden to come in a form we can be comfortable in seeing, the form in which you move and go about your business in the world, the entity complies. He adopts the form of evangelist Billy Graham.
</li><li> In Ilona Andrews' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KateDaniels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KateDaniels">Kate Daniels</a></em>' series, there's a shapeshifting infodealer named Saiman who uses his ability to physically become any man or woman he can imagine in his efforts at ferreting out information and for various social dealings. When he's doing his thirty-six-hundred-dollar-an-hour infodealing business (which, truth be told, he's worth the price because he gets results) in the comfort of his own home, he chooses to look like a pleasant, intellectual fellow approaching forty. The trope is subverting, too, as Saiman really doesn't like his own natural form <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">— a pure-white-skinned, ice-green-haired brutish looking absolute brick of a bruiser who's incidentally about eight and a half feet tall. See, Saiman owes his shapeshifting powers to his heritage. He is one-half ice giant, one-quarter human, and one-quarter god. Specifically, his grandfather is Loki. And he doesn't feel his muscles-like-rock exterior matches his genius interior.</span> So the various striking appearances he crafts — striking men and beautiful women, depending on what he feels is appropriate — are all an effort to make a form he himself is comfortable with.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnDiesAtTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnDiesAtTheEnd">John Dies at the End</a></em> by David Wong. When traveling to another dimension, the inhabitants there greet them completely in the nude for fear of appearing otherwise would disturb the visitors. They couldn't be more wrong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos">Journey to Chaos</a></em>: Gods in general are like this.
<ul><li> The innards of Noitearc, the Great Tree that Supports the worlds, are seen as tunnels of rainbow light by the mortals traveling them. This is because they can't comprehend its true nature.
</li><li> Right in the first chapter of the first book, Tasio's true form is stated to be something "far less pleasing" to behold than his default elven form.
</li><li> Reapers look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a> because that's what humans are familiar with. Being abstract creatures, they shift their physical manifestation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper">in order to appear more comforting</a> (rogue reapers do the same to inspire terror).
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a> spin-off novel, <em>Wetworks</em> by Dave Stone: An alien adopts the form of a certain famous cartoon character in an attempt to make the humans it deals with more comfortable; it doesn't really work, partly because seeing a cartoon character in the flesh is actually pretty discomforting, and partly because although the alien's shape has changed it neglected to do anything about the fact that it constantly emits a toxic gas.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKharkanasTrilogy">The Kharkanas Trilogy</a></em> Azathanai don't have one fixed physical form, as they can shapeshift at will.

When it gives lectures at the M.I.T. for a while, it is forced to assume a personality (an eloquent and apodictical preacher) so the humans can at least begin to accept it as an interlocutor, even though both sides are perfectly aware of the pretense.

<ul><li> The Arisians. Mentor, in particular, has manifested as a giant brain in a jar, a giant brain <em>not</em> in a jar, a hard-bitten detective, a university professor, and a seven-foot woman. Though, given how the Arisians work, this may be less "A Form You Are Comfortable With" and more "A Form That Will Elicit the Desired Reactions". In any event, they don't achieve this by taking physical forms but rather by projecting the desired forms as mental images to their audience. (It's revealed to Kimball Kinnison on what he believes is his second visit that it's the first time he, or in fact <em>any</em> human, has ever <em>actually</em> landed on the planet Arisia. Also, not only is Mentor's apparent form not his real form, but he's not even really an Arisian ... "he" is a mental fusion of four individual Arisians.)

The Arisians, knowing that even a second-level Lensman looking upon the true form of an Eddorian will go mad, "disguise" the Eddorian as a giant brain-thing and pass it off as a renegade Arisian. The <em>third</em>-level Lensmen who later encounter Eddorians presumably get the full experience, but they're also mentally equipped to handle it, having minds that (at least <em>in potentia</em>) surpass the Arisians' own.

They went to all this trouble because, as we find out towards the end, the Saudar were ugly as sin and would not have been accepted by any alien race they encountered; they needed the shapeshifters to act as their ambassadors.

If you think that sounds like a poor excuse to cut corners on the show's special effects, congratulations, you're smarter than the target demographic. (In the books, Visser Three does a human form that he uses on a few occasions, but <em>always</em> with a specific purpose; it's a tool like turning into a bird or a bear is for the Animorphs themselves, and he has more than one.

Once, Quark found a way of talking to them, and they got to use Sisko's form as well.

</li><li> The Changelings. Odo was essentially doing this every episode, which would actually make this the most frequent occurrence of this trope in the whole franchise. It was actually an instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> when he <em>stopped</em> being so compulsive about "A Form You Are Comfortable With" and became more interested in experiencing his own shapeshifter-hood, acquiring quarters and outfitting them with various objects to imitate, and "sleeping" anywhere he liked instead of in a bucket in his office. It was also provocative when he met Laas, another one of the hundred changeling babies sent to explore the galaxy, and one who, bitter at the Solids, had no interest in making them "comfortable". But like the Q example above, all of the other changelings appear in a form resembling Odo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">mostly-human-but-just-a-little-off appearance</a> despite being capable of perfectly mimicking any species in the galaxy (Odo, being young for a changling and having been separated from the people who could teach him, isn't quite that proficient).

The first time we meet them, they're taking on that form in order to be this to <em>Odo</em>, who has never met another of his own species. In their future dealings with the Alpha Quadrant, they recognize that the Alpha Quadrant's idea of what Changelings look like is based on Odo, so when they're openly presenting themselves as Changelings, rather than imitate any particular species, they take on the form that they know people will recognize as "Changeling".

Considering that the demon seals her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Faustian deals</a> with a kiss, this probably plays into her advantage.

Subverted in later episodes. The demons will appear in whatever body they've decided to possess, and they don't <em>always</em> pick a body just to seduce a human. Instead of a sexy lady or a young stud, Crowley (King of the Crossroads) possessed something along the lines of a well-heeled, middle-aged Englishman.
</li><li> Angels have to possess human "vessels" in order to interact with humans, because seeing an angel's true form will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">burn out a person's eyes</a> and its true voice causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">shattered glass and bleeding ears</a>.

She was a human, but became an angel again, which destroyed her human body. She decided that she liked that body, and "calls in some favors" to get it back.
</li><li> In season 5, when Lucifer is released but has not taken a human vessel yet, he appears to his first vessel Nick in the form of Nick's deceased wife to make the offer to become his willing channeler more persuasive.

While there, the garden at the center of Heaven will change its appearance according to what the viewer most expects it to look like, becoming the botanical gardens in Cleveland for Sam and Dean. Also, angels still appear human and wingless, which is even lampshaded by Zachariah:
<div class="indent"><strong>Zachariah:</strong> In Heaven I have six wings and four faces, one of which is a lion. You see this because you're... limited.
</div></li><li> Reapers also tend to appear in the form of a human to the recently deceased, such as Tessa appearing to Dean as an attractive young woman when her true form proved rather frightening to him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dean:</strong> You sure are a lot prettier than the last reaper I saw. <br/><strong>Tessa:</strong> You saw my true form and flipped out. It kinda hurts a girl's feelings.

Seeing the face of God is said to result in instantaneous death. Moses, a favored prophet, was treated to a view of the back of God; it left his face glowing. In fact, God is said to have no physical form, and it is considered blasphemous to ascribe one to him. Jesus, on the other hand, interacted with many people without people dying from his presence.
<ul><li> This may include "the angel of the Lord" in the Old Testament; some scholars interpret this as Jesus before his incarnation.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em>Tao te Ching</em> is an attempt to do this to the Tao, through a series of analogies.
</li><li> For the most part, the followers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology">Egyptian Mythology</a> understood that the various forms ascribed to their various gods weren't supposed to be how the gods actually were.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology">Hinduism</a>, this trope is sometimes performed through the use of avatars. Most famously, Vishnu occasionally manifests on earth to communicate to mortals in human form. In the Bhagavad-Gita, Vishnu speaks to prince Arjuna through his human avatar Lord Krishna. At one point, Arjuna asks if he can be allowed to see Krishna's true eternal divine form and the avatar agrees. He does first have to grant Arjura a divine sense however, since human eyes cannot see or comprehend the universal form of God.

<ul><li> Most Beholders are insane, convinced that they embody the perfection and any minuscule deviations from it should be exterminated, and thus (being an <em>extremely</em> flexible species) wage constant species-wide civil war. It's caused by their deity, "Great Mother" who also spawns different hive mothers in every clutch who in turn spawn different variant beholders. But how it's compatible with seeing Great Mother itself? Simple: every <em>individual</em> sees its own features (scaled up).
</li><li> More literally, the very intelligent large or magically mighty beings in <em>D&amp;D</em>, like dragons and deities, will often use their shape-changing abilities to become a human simply to make their human associates less freaked out (usually for the ulterior purpose of getting laid). It's where all the ridiculous half-whatever templates come from. Although sometimes it does cross over with forms the being finds comfortable — silver dragons stereotypically <em>really like</em> hanging out in humanoid form to the point they have been known to do it long-term with only other silver dragons around.

<ul><li> The Emperor did this as a matter of necessity, appearing as (very) large human wearing armour because his true form would also expose any viewers to his psychic presence, which even ten thousand years after his apparent death is powerful enough to burn out the eyes of anyone who makes even momentary psychic contact with him and is capable of maintaining a galactic navigation beacon. Sort of. He actually IS a giant man in stupendously ornate armor. Whether he grew into gianthood or performed genetic experimentation on himself is never stated. What he actually masks is his <em>psychic power</em>, not his body. Baseline humans that see him are dazzled by a blinding light about one notch down from a Beatific Vision.

On the other hand, Psychic <em>blanks</em> like his Sisters of Silence bodyguards see... just a man.
</li><li> Slaanesh, like the other Chaos Gods, can't really be said to have a true form due to being a product of the Warp (the collective psychic energy of all living things). What makes her/him/it a little different from the other gods is that as the god(dess) of desire, she/he/it shapes itself to the person's deepest desires.

Prior to that, he appeared as a golden scaled humanoid tyrannosaurus in honor of the Dragon Kings, who were his most ardent worshipers. He's also capable of assuming practically any form if he wants to make himself more (or less) comforting to another. His reason for assuming other forms is partially as an expression of respect and solidarity, partially for the sake of being comforting and partially because his true form (a humanoid figure of molten gold and obsidian studded with galaxies, with blazing eyes and countless arms) would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">burn out the senses of practically any being that viewed it</a>.

The official explanation for this is that they're afraid of you, but this hardly seems to hold for those who tell you that to talk to them, you need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">"ditch the crazy outfit"</a>.

<ul><li> All powerful dragons have the ability to take on a human(oid) form whenever they want. Some even adopt aliases and pass themselves off as (relatively) normal people to suit their purposes (be they good <em>or</em> evil). That said, the method of getting aliases and infiltrating mortal societies has become so well-known that savvy people can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWalkAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWalkAmongUs">spot a dragon-in-mortal-form from a mile away</a>. In response, some dragons have stopped bothering with perfect disguises and let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">some of their draconic featured remain visible</a>, thus increasingly subverting this trope. Most dragons prefer to take elven forms, as they believe humans to be inferior creatures. Even Korialstrasz/Krasus, who is pretty friendly to humans, takes the form of an elderly elven mage. Deathwing and his ilk only take human forms in order to infiltrate the human society. Other dragons occasionally appear as other races, such as goblins, but only when they're undercover. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerGenderConfusion">Chronormu/Chromie</a> seems to be the only dragon who preferentially adopts a gnome as their mortal form because it suits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">her</a> personality.
<ul><li> According to Alexstrasza, dragons tend to take humanoid forms when meeting each other because it's easier to have a meeting space large enough for several humanoids than one for several dragons.
</li></ul></li><li> The ethereals also invoke this trope. Beings of pure energy in their normal form, they take a more approachable guise when trading with mortal races.
</li><li> Implied with the goblin bank manager Glutonia. Alodi references her being an elf only for Meryl Felstorm to reply that she's a goblin, to which Alodi makes a remark about her changing forms every so often.

During the party's first meeting with Pung Ryong, the wind dragon, he comments "perhaps this form will be easier on your eyes" as his humanoid form appears.
</li><li> Mephasm, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> pit-fiend in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>, always takes the form of a purple-skinned half-elf when the player character sees him.

Being powerful psychic beings, they automatically give off a psychic aura that makes anyone looking at them see a divine, "good" creature from their own mythology instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">their true forms</a> (as an example, most humans see angels). Since the Morrigi are traders and diplomats by nature, this tends to smooth over diplomatic functions with other species quite nicely. Interestingly, this aura is primarily meant to attract females, similar to the tail feathers of male peacocks. Morrigi females look for a male with the most beautiful (i.e. strongest) aura, while Morrigi males look for a female who can resist their aura.

He freaks out and tries to kill them with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">big laser</a>, only to get himself killed. <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/w2/images2/thumb/d/d4/Purple_vok.jpg/300px-Purple_vok.jpg">Here is their true form.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> in general have this trope as their M.O.; thus the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a>, "Robots in Disguise." But in <em>Beast Wars</em> it works both ways. Not only do the Maximal and Predacon Beast Modes provide a way to blend in with their environment, but the forms also provide a "skin" that protects them from dangerous raw energon radiation, thus also making it a form <em>they're</em> comfortable with. At least through the first season, if they stayed in their robot forms for too long, their systems start overloading.

They are supposed to say that home is "in your hearth", but it was actually in another dimension they could access through a dimensional wormhole at the back of the Chinese food restaurant.

<ul><li> Some zoos have been known to feed animals using hand puppets that look like an adult of that species.
<ul><li> This is actually necessary for baby primates when humans are feeding them. The human wears a monkey suit to simulate the fur of the mom. This way the baby will accept the mother when returned to her.
</li><li> It's also necessary for avians. Birds that "imprint" on humans as infants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousAdoption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousAdoption">will think that humans are like them, or that they are like humans</a>. This can lead to difficulties if the bird in question is a part of a breeding program to keep the species from dying out. Ducks and geese are best known for this problem, and may actually end up not knowing how to fly since humans don't. This is referenced in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards">Guards! Guards!</a></em>, in which a human raised by dwarves is likened to a duck raised by chickens.
<ul><li> Worse, a hawk or owl who is imprinted on humans may not be able to hunt and would fly to humans it found once released in the wild, hoping for food. A raptor imprint can end up a permanent captivity resident.
</li><li> The most famous phenomenon this leads to is talking birds; for a parrot to be ready to learn to talk, it has to be separated from any other parrot, so that it imprints on its human owner and tries to imitate it.
</li></ul></li><li> Some Chinese zoos have had their zookeepers <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fXBRKWmICU">dress up like pandas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when taking care of baby pandas in the zoo. The logic behind this is that the baby pandas won't form human attachment so that they can be released into the wild later on.
</li></ul></li><li> Quantum mechanics can be a bit like this. One example is the quadrupolar echo pulse sequence in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The math works out perfectly, but trying to visualize it invariably winds up with the spin pointing 90 degrees from where the math says it should be and where experiment confirms that it actually is. The lesson here is that once you get deep enough, physics really <em>is</em> just math, and what you <em>think</em> of as "physics" is just a Form You Are Comfortable With.
</li><li> Computer interfaces. Raw binary data is near-impossible to process for humans, and the inner workings of software are not only difficult to understand, but aren't of interest to most users. User interface is an abstraction that presents only the data the user wants, and in an easily understood form at that. Even most programmers deal with high-level programming languages and platforms that abstract away many layers of complexity irrelevant to the task.
</li><li> A less extreme version of this trope would be "a form you will find more useful", and is practically ubiquitous with diagrams and route maps. If you're trying to find your way around a metro system, or build a complicated electrical circuit, a simplified not-to-scale representation using accepted symbols will be much more helpful than a completely accurate photorealistic image of the system. By extension, pretty much all metaphors, allegories or symbolism could be said to be aspects of this trope.
