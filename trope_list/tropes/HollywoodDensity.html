This results in such oddities as most metals, including gold, being treated as weighing the same as an equivalent volume of iron or steel, with the possible exceptions of aluminum (famous for weighing less) and lead (famous for weighing a lot). The only thing typically treated as denser than lead is matter from a neutron star, by orders of magnitude — there's apparently nothing in between.
</p><p>By the same token, anyone can lift as much of a "light" object, such as feathers, Styrofoam, or in the worst cases even <em>stacked flat paper</em>, as can be made practical to carry (though, interestingly, if the paper is in another form, this doesn't seem to apply as much, as characters will frequently acknowledge that stacks of books or newspapers are heavy.)

</p><p>Generally, the only exception to "people carrying around big gold ingots with ease" comes when the density of gold relative to other substances is itself a major plot point. Especially since gold is actually 70% more dense than lead. To say nothing of the fact that gold's status as a dense substance is rather well known; anyone who's ever worn a gold ring can tell that it's heavier than a silver one.

Keep in mind that sometimes reality can make something incredibly boring. (One of the most common house rules for most tabletop games is that gold is weightless, because having a weight penalty for your character's money <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">would detract from the fun of the game</a>.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Balloonacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Balloonacy">Balloonacy</a> is a subtrope dealing with wild over- and under-estimations of the lifting capacity of Helium, Hydrogen or hot air. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a> follows this trope, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriefcaseFullOfMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriefcaseFullOfMoney">Briefcase Full of Money</a> is closely related.

It's understandable that technology would go in this direction given that even in the original series weapons had become so powerful that armor was of limited use, and thus making the war machines fast and agile to dodge was a better form of protection. But <em>how</em> they made the mobile suits so light required <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> metals to be physically possible.

Of course, utterly ridiculous feats of strength are <em>very</em> common in the series.
<ul><li> In that same arc, however, Luffy got his hand stuck in a large ball of gold, its heaviness serving to anchor him where he is.

However, just a bit later Rosa uses the same bag as a blunt weapon with extreme effectiveness — consistency was just too much trouble, apparently. In the Visual Novel, the ingot is given an approximate weight of, I believe, around 11 kilograms; in addition, it's directly stated that what she carries is in a blanket which she later use as a weapon against the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> goatmen attacking her and Maria</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheFumaConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheFumaConspiracy">The Fuma Conspiracy</a></em>, Fujiko successfully smuggles a large shingle made of gold under her jacket and moves very quickly and agilely despite the presumed large weight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TomoChanIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TomoChanIsAGirl">Tomo-chan Is a Girl!</a></em>, Carol gives Tomo three gold bars as a birthday present. They're smaller than the usual house brick-sized bars you see in fiction (small enough that she can carry all three bundled in a handkerchief like a <em>bento</em> box), but she's still a fairly ordinary high schooler and she still carries the bundle in one hand. Amusingly, the weight issue is brought up when Carol mistakes Tomo's shock for disappointment and explains that she went with smaller bars because bigger ones would weigh too much.

When transforming into his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromeChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromeChampion">metal form</a>, his height becomes 226 cm, while his weight doubles to 228 kg. Assuming these numbers are correct, refers to him turning into metal instead of just gaining a metal coating, his human density is roughly equal to 1 kg/l, his metal form would have a density of 1.35 kg/l, or about half the density of aluminium. The kicker? The metal he transforms into is explicitly compared to osmium, the element with the highest density (22.6 kg/l, or exactly twice as dense as lead). If his metal form actually was osmium, Colossus would weigh 3826 kg. At other times it has been referred to as "omnium", a fictional metal that has no specified properties other than being really strong. (A few comics have suggested that Colossus is all or partly <em>hollow</em> in metal form, but that just raises new questions.)
</li><li> The titular superhero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision">The Vision</a></em> has the power to "control his density". This power is used often to become intangible, super-hard, and <em>heavy.</em> Changing density doesn't affect his volume, either. Presumably, the mass needed to increase or decrease his density comes/goes to another dimension; this is the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwave</a> for all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterBaggage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterBaggage">Shapeshifter Baggage</a> and similar issues in the Marvel Universe.
</li><li> Mass Master from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerPack">Power Pack</a></em> has the power to change his density, which <em>also</em> changes his volume. His mass remains the same. Becoming denser shrinks the Mass Master, and becoming less dense makes him a cloud larger than his original body.
</li><li> Doll Man, in DC's relaunched Doll Man and Phantom Lady miniseries, became tiny, because his density was increased, while keeping his mass the same - thus making the fact that he can throw punches that full sized people can actually feel plausible. Awesome, makes perfect sense. They also have scenes of Phantom Lady holding him in her hand, or on her shoulder. So the issue of his mass is ignored during those instances.

Given the density of silver, the cauldron should weigh more than Asterix does. Despite that, he is able to carry the full cauldron without the aid of the magic potion. When the cauldron and its contents fall off a cliff and lands on Captain Redbeard, the captain is somehow uninjured.

In the WW2 era, the price of gold was fixed at $35 per troy ounce, so $16 million worth would weigh 15.67 U.S. short tons and have a volume of 26 cubic feet. It has been calculated that the writers grossly misrepresented the size and weight of that much gold given how much is visible in the movie and the means they use to carry it away.

Harry swims through a growing avalanche of them when he should actually be pretty quickly crushed, or should at least break a lot of bones and be rendered immobile.

That much gold would make a cube about 3.5 feet in each direction — about the size of a small refrigerator — but they make a bar nearly as long as a train car, several feet wide, and a few feet high — at least 300 tons worth, at a rough estimate.
<ul><li> To top that off, the protagonist crashes the train into a bay and then is able to float the gold container away with nothing more than a dozen party-sized balloons.

When Indy looks at it, he actually removes sand from the bag to approximate its weight and later events even suggest that he guessed too low. While it's never explicitly stated that the idol is <em>solid</em> gold even a hollow gold object that size would be much too heavy to be toted around as easily as it is.

Unless composed entirely of puny .22's, the ammo alone would weigh closed to 100 pounds with the weapons themselves adding an equal amount. While this is nothing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> character couldn't handle, the bag he puts it all in sits high up on his back as if it were filled with clothes.

Assuming it's all in C-notes to minimize the number of bills, that much money would weigh roughly a ton and a half. Unless the team was all into heavy-duty bodybuilding, there's no way they could have moved that much weight in one trip as was shown in the finale. Despite all the careful planning involved in the heist, the question of how to lift 300 pound duffel bags and carry them out of the casino without giving away that the bags are a lot heavier coming out than going in isn't mentioned.

<ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>, Kenneth has an idea for a game show in which contestants guess which suitcase being carried by models is filled with gold. The show was discontinued for being too easy, as one had only to look for the model who had trouble holding up the suitcase. This perhaps qualifies as both a lampshade <em>and</em> a straight example of this trope; even a small briefcase will have a volume of some 1,000 cubic inches, so one <em>full</em> of gold would weigh over 700 pounds. By comparison, the current deadlift record is just over 1,000 pounds, so you'd need to be a seriously ripped professional strongman to even move that briefcase.
</li><li> At the other end of the scale, one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> has the team investigating a casino heist, supposedly of ten million dollars in cash. Grissom realizes the money would weigh around two hundred pounds — far too much for one man (seen in security footage) to practically carry. (It isn't stated, but it would also be unfeasibly bulky). The 200 pounds (actually closer to 220) presumes it's all in $100 banknotes. A more normal mix of currency would about double this. A million US dollars in mixed currency fills a large suitcase, and one would probably have to pay over-weight charges to fly with it. $250,000 (in $100 bills) fits carefully into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a>-style aluminum attache case. Note, however, that having it all in $100s is not actually an unreasonable assumption for a casino heist, as the casino presumably sorts the cash, and a smart thief with limited resources would probably want to take his/her whole heist in the form of $100s if possible.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>, a character uses alchemy to create a big lump of solid gold, which the characters lift and carry as easily as if it was polystyrene.
</li><li> A DVD commentary on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> pointed out this trope to highlight actors John Schnieder's acting abilities. In a scene where Jonathan Kent and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Clark Kent</a> are moving bales of hay, Jonathan is visibly having a hard time carrying the prop hay. The production staff had forgotten real hay bales do weigh a lot and Schnieder, who had had some farm experience, decided to portray this right. The actor playing Clark Kent had no such experience, but given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">who he is</a>, it actually helped to make the two characters believable.

The video of her statement has her comment on picking up the head and being surprised at how much it weighed. A detective who'd worked the case commented that's one of the reasons they were confident the confession was valid: unless you'd actually picked up a detached head, it's not the sort of thing someone would think about.

Sharpe is assigned to escort a party carrying a box that, to allay suspicion, they claim is full of old papers and documents. However, they lift the box around with ease invoking this trope.

When they wake up, they crash the truck trying to get back to town, and hike back to town instead, carrying backpacks full of dozens of gold ingots each.

Hank laughs it off as a joke. Subverted even further by the bag making an appropriately loud thud when it lands in Hank's trunk.
</li><li> In season 4, when the amount of money that Walt brings in proves too much to launder through the car wash, Skyler tries to hide several hundred thousand dollars in cash by sticking the bills in vacuum bags between little-used clothes and hanging the bags in the closet. The bags weigh so much they break the closet's hang rod, so she stores the vacuum bags (clothes and all) under the floorboards instead.

Gold bricks such as those found in a major gold repository weigh about 25 pounds, give or take, so hitting somebody with one would stand a good chance of knocking them out. However, the same factor means that most people would not be able to grip, lift and swing said brick one-handed. At least not while reaching behind oneself while bent over backwards.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> had the villain acquiring $108,000 in one dollar bills, treating them with a contact poison, and then distributing them (Some dropped, some left in charity donation containers, some spent...) all over town as an act of terrorism. The money is shown to be coming out of a duffel bag, which would be accurate for the volume needed, but at no point does it look like the bag weighs about as much as the person carrying it (108,000 bills would weigh roughly 200 pounds).

<ul><li> Classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> rated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> by their total mass. Which is fine as far as it goes, but the fluff assigned height and width values to several of the more iconic chassis that would leave them with a low enough density to float on water, such as the 100 tons, 18 metre Atlas.
<ul><li> This gets hilarious when various 'Mechs are depicted with other units or infantry for scale. For instance, the relatively diminutive Wasp is twenty tons and explicitly stated as six meters tall in one book, while the aforementioned Atlas is described as sixteen meters tall and one hundred tons. If both were scaled to similar heights, the Wasp would be over 3.75 times denser than the Atlas.
</li><li> It gets worse with DropShips. A large Dropship weighs ten thousand tons, and is protected by 30 tons of armor. Considering it's a hundred meter sphere, it comes to the ship being about fifteen times as dense as air, and the armor being <em>paper thin</em>.
</li><li> Additionally, some mechs have pencil-thin feet that would sink through even paved surfaces.
</li><li> On the other side of the scale, the Star League-era Rotunda scout car, which is disguised as a luxury sports car and armed with a Large Laser, is listed with a weight of <em>twenty tons</em>. Light for a combat vehicle, but about ten times the weight of a typical sports car.
</li></ul></li><li> First Edition <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</a></em> went too far in the <em>opposite</em> direction than usual: all coins were assumed to weigh a whopping 1/10 of a pound each. This would make one gold piece bigger and heavier than almost any gold coin known to exist in real world history. Back then, the logistics of getting your treasure <em>out</em> of the dungeon were very much intended — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">if not always spelled out as such</a> — to be part of the challenge. Later editions ignored or downplayed this aspect.
</li><li> Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> acknowledges that gold is ill-suited to adventuring gear, <em>Ultimate Equipment</em> states that weapons and armor made of solid gold weigh 50% more than normal. That number would more accurately be 2.4 times heavier.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Many games featuring weight limits for what a character can carry measure everything in the same unit. This can become a problem when the unit was designed with some common adventuring item (such as an arrow or dagger) weighing "1 unit," in which case items that should be much lighter (jewels, scrolls?) end up weighing the exact same amount as "base" items. A common workaround is to give such items a weight of zero, which can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">lead to massive hoarding</a> if any of them are common and useful.
<ul><li> In lieu of such possible hoarding, certain games may opt for body slots for items of negligible weight, meaning only a certain number of these items may be worn at a time.
</li><li> And since it keeps coming up, many of these games give you a strict limit to how much equipment you can carry, say, 100 lbs. And then lets you carry around, on your person, hundreds of thousands of units (typically coins) of gold which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalletOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalletOfHolding">don't factor into encumbrance</a> <em>at all</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most fantasy CRPGs (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>, etc.) track encumbrance on items, but money is weightless, so it's permissible to walk around with five million gold coins without a sweat.
</li><li> The info in the Pokédex in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> frequently applies this to living things, giving weights that are often ridiculously heavy or light: Wailord is 14.5 m long, yet only weights about 400 kg.
<ul><li> Apparently some Pokémon are <em>less dense than hydrogen.</em>
</li><li> The whale family are at least called "float whale Pokémon," as Wailord is likely based on a blimp and its original form, Wailmer, seems to be based on a beach ball. However, how they manage to dive is the real question.
</li><li> Also, sometimes in the anime, people are shown carrying Pokémon whose Pokédex entry gives them a considerable weight with more ease than the average parent holding a baby for extended periods. Ash's Larvitar is probably the most infamous example since the average Larvitar weighs 158.7 lbs (72.0 kg, i.e. something you would expect from an average adult), but because it's only 2 feet tall (just slightly more than a newborn baby), the animators assumed 10-year old Ash Ketchum would have no problem carrying it around.
</li><li> This is one of the reasons for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> theory that the ten-year-old player character in the games is the one writing the Pokédex entries. He/she is just making up numbers that sound right to them and wildly over- and underestimating everything in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tibia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tibia">Tibia</a></em> treats gold as a stackable (up to 100 per slot) object. 100 of them equal a platinum coin and 100 of those equals a Crystal coin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>
<ul><li> Throughout most of the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheapGoldCoins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheapGoldCoins">gold coins</a> do not have a weight. Thanks to all of the series plentiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">Money for Nothing</a>, it isn't unusual to see players running around with <em>tens of thousands</em> of gold coins, yet not be slowed in the slightest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em> provides an exception to the above gold coin example. Gold coins do have weight (400 gold = 1kg), however, this is still in line with the trope, being far less than 400 similarly sized gold coins would weigh in real life. You can also deposit gold in various regional banks, who will give you a nondescript "letter of credit" which only weigh 0.25kg. Banks do have an "administrative charge" equal to 1% of the amount you are requesting. It may feel harsh to lose 1000 gold, but it is well worth it to gave a 0.25kg piece of paper worth 100,000 gold (which would weigh 250kg in actual gold).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>, everything has a rather realistic weight to it, however, your character can still lift an insane amount without being slowed down. Humorously, this means often times it's more practical to steal/loot cheaper stuff (like clothes) than heavy weapons and armor because its value:weight ratio is higher and thus you can walk away with more of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> All ingots of metal weigh the same (1 unit). This includes gold, which would obviously be much denser than an iron or steel ingot of the same dimensions.
</li><li> The crafting system leads to some amusing math as well. For example, a 3-pound bear pelt yields 4 pounds of leather.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Many games with a storage system will often overlook that the amount of items and weight of some of them will either not fit in the specified container used, or would end up being so weighty and bulky the character couldn't move around as effectively as they are shown to. Of note, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em> comes to mind with its backpack inventory system, fitting an RPG, two rifles, and an assortment of pistol sized weapons, along with medical supplies, rations, and any critter you caught, while not weighing Big Boss down. They only become weighty when equipped on his person.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, the player can carry nearly 45,000 metric tons, and a 12-meter cube can be broken down and placed into a &lt;1 m chest.
</li><li> Also is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, with the Attache case. Never mind an RPG weighs a lot, or that a fully loaded case would probably be too heavy to lift. And how does the Merchant hide that in his coat?
</li><li> Don't forget Link in...well, every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">Zelda</a></em> game ever. But especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>, where he can swing his giant hammer almost as well as his sword, and the Iron Boots only make him sink if he's wearing them — not while he has them stored inside his other boots (or wherever it is that they go).
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend of Zelda I</a></em> Link carries around with him, on top of the usual armour of shield, sword, bombs, arrows, etc, an entire raft and a ladder big enough to bridge small streams and gaps with.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em> assigned weight to coins, as well as having money come in different denominations (copper, silver, gold and platinum). Along with the way fall damage was calculated, it meant it was entirely possible to commit unintentional suicide by grabbing a couple thousand platinum from the bank - and abruptly taking 20k damage from the "drop" when you stepped off the threshold of the bank's front door.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery">Adom</a></em> also assigns weight to gold pieces. It's quite possible to get crushed under the weight the gold you are carrying if your magic fails you. With normal in-game methods you can accumulate hundreds of kilos of gold. Abusing a bug you can get hundred thousand kilos.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedDrakesFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedDrakesFortune">Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</a></em>, Nate realizes the golden statue they're looking for was brought to the island when he looks at some old freight logs and notices something weighing "about 500 pounds". A cube of gold that weighed 500 pounds would have about 8.94 inches (22.7 cm) to a side. The statue they find looks like it should weight several <em>tons</em> at least. But then, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the statue isn't solid</span>.
</li><li> Not sure if it's a subversion or what, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaII">Mafia II</a></em>, one level has you giving the Chinese Mafia money in exchange for heroin. One of the head guy's bodyguards hefts the briefcase then tips it out, stating the denomination of the bills, their weight and how much that weight equals in money.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> expansion <em>The Pitt</em> you are sent on a quest to collect 10 steel ingots out of a possible 100. Each steel ingot weighs 1 pound. If you collect them all before turning in the quest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">their weight won't count against your carry limit</a>. If you collect some, complete the quest, and then go back for the rest, the remaining ingots will each weigh their full amount.
</li><li> The first expansion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, <em>Dead Money</em>, subverts this at the end when the player finds a vault with 37 gold bars. Each bar is worth 10,439 caps, a ridiculously large amount, but each bar also weighs 35 pounds. You're under a strict time limit to escape with whatever you can carry, and if you carry more than your encumbrance limit, you move far too slowly to make it out. If a player wanted to take all the barsa total of 382,913 caps, enough that you'd basically never need money agains/he would be carrying 1,295 pounds. The highest possible carry weight a player could have (i.e. max Strength and various Perks) is 375 pounds, so a player could only carry 10 of the bars at most without being over-encumbered, and they'd have to drop everything they were already carrying. To make this all sillier, no vendor in the game ever has more than 8,000 caps. It's impossible to sell even a single bar for its total value. Some have speculated that this is meant to tie into a theme of letting greed go, as the inability to even find enough caps in the whole wasteland to make gathering all those bars worth it kind of makes the bars...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Dead Money</a> (the natural progression is to take out some in trade, but even then it is difficult to find a vendor with that much to spare).
<ul><li> It's entirely possible to leave the vault with every single bar through clever use of the game world, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">by loading the gold into a dead body, decapitating it and carrying the head manually,</a> or getting your companions to carry some of the gold before time runs out. Even without exploits, it's possible to take a shortcut by sneaking past a very alert NPC, avoiding the timed-run and giving the player plenty of time to escape with all the bars, as the player character can still walk at a waddling pace even if they're carrying over half a ton of gold. A perk called "Long Haul" also enables the PC to fast-travel while over-encumbered, and <em>Old World Blues</em> introduces a device that the player can use to instantly teleport themselves to the Sink, where a merchant waits with a respawning +14,000 caps.
</li><li> <em>New Vegas</em> also features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">whitewash</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">"Hardcore Mode"</a> - where (among other things) ammo has weight. At first, it doesn't make much of a difference when individual bullets weigh 1/15 to 1/10 of a pound - but when players start acquiring automatic weapons that eat bullets like candy, or come across rocket launchers whose individual rockets weigh two pounds apiece, it really starts to cut down on what you can carry compared to normal mode. (Though even in hardcore, there are many completely weightless items - including gunpowder and shell casings.) This is made more annoying by many junk items used for crafting being exactly 1 pound, an apparent default value, even if it makes no sense. Somehow a scalpel, forceps, and a <em>single tin can</em> all weigh a whole pound each.
</li><li> Both <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em> have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a> component called a fission battery. They're the size and shape of 9-volt batteries, yet weigh <em>10 pounds</em> in <em>Fallout 3</em> and 6 pounds in <em>New Vegas</em>. A portable fission battery would be denser than a regular battery, since nuclear fuel and shielding are both heavy, but a 10 pound object that size would be ten times the density of <em>pure uranium.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em> fan novel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGEpisode">"Witches and Woodlands."</a> Those who wager their weight in gold in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Mammon's</a> trial and lose are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turned into gold statues</a> to pay the debt. George protests that the density of gold means that the statues would weigh more than the living victims. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Beatrice</a> hastily handwaves it by saying that the statues are hollow before muttering, "Damn, I hate science! Always messing with my magic."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Payday2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Payday2">Payday 2</a></em>: characters can throw bags of gold effortlessly, making it faster to constantly throw a bag of gold forward then pick it up as opposed to simply carrying it. (The developers noticed this as well, and with tongue-in-cheek referred to their game as a "bag throwing simulator.")
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> series, based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, likewise rates its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> by metric tonnage. The issue of silly tonnages and densities is exacerbated by the mechs being largely to-scale with each other and the environment unlike the often out-of-scale sourcebook art from <em>Battletech</em>. The Atlas in <em>Mechwarrior 4</em> is taller than a 6 story building and its feet are as large as a small tank, but it's only 100 tons, twice the weight of a M1 Abrams. Later games are slightly better in this regard. Amusingly, in <em>Mechwarrior Living Legends</em>, mechs will spontaneously <em>become buoyant</em> if they are ragdolled from leg damage while underwater; just about every mech would naturally be about as dense as Styrofoam or plywood.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a></em>, Bernard gets $876,600 in quarters from a vending machine. That much change would weigh just under 20 tons. And Bernard lacks sufficient upper-body strength to pick up a bowling ball.

When Fry (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBall">of all people</a>) asks "Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?", the Robot Devil admits that it's mostly for show. Nevertheless, Leela picks the fiddle up and attempts to play it moments later, and it seems to be an ordinary fiddle. The fiddle later proves to be so heavy that that they have to drop it before flying out of Robot Hell.
</li><li> There was also an episode where they go to a planet where the gravity is extremely heavy (as the professor says "You'd be crushed by the weight of your own hair"). Pillows weigh hundreds of pounds and raindrops can knock someone down. The crew tried lifting all the pillows at once and the dolly they were using fell apart almost instantly, as did Zapp Brannigan's girdle.

Including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuy">Big Guy</a> Armon's golden arm. Now, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuy">Big Guy</a> it's not such a strain that he can make use of an arm made of gold, but their twelve-year-old friend Presley can lift it as easily as if it was made of cardboard.
<ul><li> In <em>Who's who</em> however when Rath and Armon have their minds switched, Rath is unable to properly use Armon's golden arm as even with Armon's muscles and size, he isn't used to carrying such a large weight.

<ul><li> At some old gold mines in Canada, one gag played on new miners (and visitors) was to tell them that if they could lift a brick of gold off the table with one hand gripping it from the top, they could have it. The joke worked because of the density (something about the size of an ordinary brick weighs about thirty kilograms), shape of the brick, and smoothness of the metal, making it impossible to get a grip strong enough to lift it. This was demonstrated in that exact fashion on an episode of the Canadian documentary series <em>Ed's Up,</em> which stars <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies">Barenaked Ladies</a>' Ed Robertson. While he was working at a facility that produces gold bricks, the employees told him if he could pick up the gold brick (the size of an ordinary brick) and carry it out without assistance, it was his to keep. The best he could was turn it on its side, after a great deal of effort. There was a slight lip on the brick after it had been stamped on the top, which he thought might help, but it was of no avail.
</li><li> There is a story about an 18th century nobleman trying to pick up a platinum ingot about 10 cm across. He then complained gluing the metal to the table wasn't funny.
</li><li> Anyone who ever found some iron pyrite, picked it up easily, and still thought it was gold instead of fool's gold has fallen victim to this trope.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3r5ew');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3r5ew" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3r5ew');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The specific gravity of pyrite is about 5; the specific gravity of gold is 19.3. This means that a chunk of gold weighs about four times more than a chunk of pyrite the same size.</span>
</li><li> One classic trick used in lectures on muscle physiology is to fill two identical small containers, one with lightweight material and the other with lead. The lightweight container is set on display, and a student volunteer called up to lift it one-handed. After a few demonstrations of arm movements with the lighter container, the instructor switches it out for the heavy one behind the volunteer's back. When the volunteer is asked to lift it again, it either slips through their grasp or sets them off-balance, because the weight is suddenly <em>much</em> heavier and their muscles' grip and/or stance were calibrated for the lighter burden.
</li><li> An Australian kidnapping case involved the ransom being dropped at the end of a jetty, where the kidnapper planned to swim in and collect it under the nose of police who would be looking for a boat. However he underestimated the weight of the ransom and had to hold onto a jetty pylon to catch his breath before he'd gone too far, where he was spotted by a plainclothes police officer staking out the jetty.
