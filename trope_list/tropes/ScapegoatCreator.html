<ul><li> For arguably the <em>worst</em> example of this, look no further than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCouple">husband and wife team</a> of director Mitsuo Fukuda and head scriptwriter Chiaki Morosawa. They are responsible for some of the problems that afflicted the series; rather infamously, late in the show's run, an animator blogged about Morosawa's perpetual tardiness with the scripts, which turned out to come from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">her bad health</a>, which forced them to add lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a>. However, the fandom tends to exaggerate this wildly, and gladly parrots off a number of unflattering and <strong>never</strong> confirmed rumors on request, out of pure hatred for both of them ("Fukuda hates America because of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and based off Blue Cosmos and ZAFT over them"; "Cagalli got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification">demoted to extra</a> because Morosawa hates her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaomiShindo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaomiShindo">voice actress</a> personally"). All this is on top of the accusation that Kira Yamato and Lacus Clyne are their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatars</a>, used to explain why they win and look good doing so (The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RieTanaka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RieTanaka">Rie Tanaka</a> said that Lacus is a difficult role for her in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animevice.com/news/nyaf08-interview-with-rie-tanaka/78/">an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> certainly didn't help matters.) Some have even gone so far as to whine about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Morosawa's perpetual illness</a> and blame her for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> that's delayed the rumored <em>SEED</em> conclusion movie for over five years - to the creepy point of <em>hoping she dies of it as "punishment" for "ruining" the series!</em>
<ul><li> There are also rumors about other "fans" <strong>deliberately mistranslating canon material</strong> to make Fukuda and Morosawa look worse than they actually are or were; i.e., some "invented" how Fukuda insulted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenichiSuzumura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenichiSuzumura">Kenichi Suzumura</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaayaSakamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaayaSakamoto">Maaya Sakamoto</a> through Twitter when they got married when in reality he merely said he was surprised that their relationship had reached that point.) It's not helped by the infamous "Morosawa interview" that circulated around <strong>was</strong> proved to be completely fake.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Morosawa DID fall victim to her illness</a> in early 2016, <a class="urllink" href="http://khandri.tumblr.com/post/85172578225/things-i-wish-the-gundam-fandom-would-stop-doing">some fans started poking fun at her demise<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">All because the SEED series didn't develop the way they wanted!</a></strong>
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of Fukuda, he's blamed for everything wrong with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Cross Ange</a></em>, despite only being the creative producer and mecha director. Actually came to a head with the broadcast of Episode 22, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">two characters who were supposedly killed off in the previous episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">reappear with little to no explanation</a>; it also doesn't help that one of them looks suspiciously similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Kira Yamato</a> (see example above.)</span> No one ever suggests blaming the director or writer for any of the show's problems.
</li><li> Chiaki Kon is responsible for most of the problems that plagued the anime adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em> (so much so that the original writer had to step on board and supervise the second season of the former). But that doesn't stop the fans of the Sound Novels for portraying her in the most negative light possible and some even put the blame also on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioDEEN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioDEEN">Studio DEEN</a> as well, never mind the studio <em>only</em> produces the anime of the 2 adaptations.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> fans hold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo">Tite Kubo</a> responsible for the anime fillers (and for the anime in general, including openings/endings), despite the fact that he has nothing to do with the anime aside of sometimes designing characters for fillers. Probably because he's said he's "more involved" with the anime than normal mangakas. But that doesn't mean he has to be much more involved. (In fact, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> of the fourth movie had him asking to have his name removed from the movie credits, as his ideas were ultimately disregarded and he felt he wasn't involved <em>enough</em> in it.)
</li><li> For that matter, similar to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> example, manga authors are often credited with/blamed for anything that happens to the animated version of their work. Yes, some like Kubo actually <em>do</em> have involvement with the anime, but sometimes, they're often blamed for parts of the anime that they don't have any control over, <em>especially</em> fillers and pacing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShojiKawamori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShojiKawamori">Shoji Kawamori</a> is a very strange example: around the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em> was airing, quotes and interviews popped up that annoyed fans so much it started the meme "Kawamori trolled my fandom!" Then it turned out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeverSaidThat">he never actually said any of those things</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?p=2585414#post2585414">because they were fiction made up by a disgruntled member of the fandom.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This doesn't stop people from treating Kawamori like mocking the fandom is his one true love.
</li><li> Several shipping moments in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> anime earn a lot of complaints towards Hiro Mashima. Many of them were anime only, or minor, but greatly played up by the anime. One of the biggest ones even came right after the anime staff proved that they weren't consulting with Mashima for every little change they made either.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07hs6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07hs6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07hs6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They changed a spiky-haired silhouette seen in the crowd to a cloaked girl in order to keep consistent with a reveal of who a figure that several characters had been sensing was, only for it to turn out within a few weeks later in the manga that they had been detecting two different people, and it was a man that had been spotted in the crowd.</span>
</li><li> It's not uncommon for mangaka to be criticized for story elements/ideas/etc. that were actually the editor or publisher's idea (or vice-versa)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> has been getting a <em>lot</em> of blame fired at her for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em> not living up to fandom's expectations. The truth of the matter is, Naoko doesn't have nearly as much control as people think she does.
</li><li> <em>Several</em> people in charge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC">Blood-C</a></em> got smacked with this:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP">CLAMP</a> gets usually blamed by <em>Blood</em> franchise fans for tainting the series's plot with their characteristically controversial writing shenanigans. It got worse when it was leaked that Junichi Fujisaku, one of the pioneers of the saga, worked in <em>Blood C</em> only to direct the fight scenes, thus allegedly limiting his chances of getting the series right. Then it turned out in an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2011-09-01/blood-c-tsutomu-mizushima-and-junichi-fujisaku/2">ANN interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that, while he certainly wasn't in charge of the screenplay, the series's story was outlined by himself before CLAMP, and more specifically, the controversial reinventing of the show was <em>his</em> own idea. It's very telling that Junichi Fujisaku is again in charge of the screenplay of the 2015 stage play and 2017 live-action movie while CLAMP are only credited as original co-creators.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: For shipping fans who disliked the canon pairing of Naruto/Hinata, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioPierrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioPierrot">Studio Pierrot</a> has become the lightning rod of their hate, in great part because previously several of the staff from the studio had publicly declared themselves as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsFavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsFavorite">Hinata fans</a> and they were the ones who originally came up with the idea of making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie">The Last: Naruto the Movie</a></em> (which details the story of how Naruto and Hinata became a couple), as such they blame them for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">forcing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum">their preferred pairing</a> into the author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasashiKishimoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasashiKishimoto">Masashi Kishimoto</a>.

<ul><li> While Richard Garfield is largely exempt (he even had a card made of him with the art portraying him as Jesus) from the RAGE of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">Unpleasable Fanbase</a>, the current head designer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> Mark Rosewater is often blamed for breaking the game's balance.
<ul><li> This is especially funny because he's only the lead <em>designer</em>, not the lead of <em>development</em>. While design tries to get in the general area, it's really development's job to hone the balance to just right.
<ul><li> He catches blame for <em>anything</em> players dislike about the game, whether it involves card design or not! Price of packs goes up? Blame Rosewater. Bad piece of artwork? Blame Rosewater.

<ul><li> Ron Marz reportedly received death threats from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> fans upset about the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmeraldTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmeraldTwilight">Emerald Twilight</a></em> storyline (which had the hero going through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave">massacring most of the secondary characters</a> and then being killed off). This was especially unfair since Marz had the plot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">imposed on him by more senior writers</a>. Marz himself has since gone on the record saying it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">something he did for pay</a>, and was rather glad when much of Emerald Twilight was retconned. Also, it was Kevin Dooley who came up with the original concept for <em>Emerald Twilight</em>.
<ul><li> It was more than just Dooley. <em>Several</em> DC bigwigs contributed to the <em>Emerald Twilight</em> we got after they nixed Gerard Jones' original version<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1dwye');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1dwye" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1dwye');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(which, in a funny bit of irony, was due to the fact that Jones' version "brought up continuity that 'no one would get', ie the Zamarons", which would later become one of the Green Lantern books' greatest strength)</span>. In fact, Paul Levitz, Mike Carlin, Archie Goodwin, and even Denny O'Neil helped Dooley write the outline that Marz was forced to fully write. In fact, infamously in the letters section in <em>Green Lantern Vol 3 #50</em>, a blurb was written that even O'Neil, who had famously written great stories with Hal &amp; the Corps, said that Hal Jordan was "too hard to write" and was "either too nice or a jerk, leaving no lasting impression", while another (from Dooley) stated that Hal was essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter">Flat Character</a> and that things were going to be okay since "nobody was talking about [this] book or even cared about its central character to any great extent".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDiDio">Dan DiDio</a>, DC Comics editor-in-chief, gets <em>huge</em> amounts of flack for any unpopular turn any DC title takes. While the man has made more than his share of editorial blunders, he gets the blame for just about everything, regardless of whether it was his idea, another exec's, or the writer's, or whether it was something that happened before he came to DC. His antagonistic statements to fans don't help.
<ul><li> And now that he's been bumped up to co-publisher, it's likely he'll get a lot more Mis Blame (Bob Harras is now DC's editor-in-chief and Bobbie Chase is the executive editor while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a> is Chief Creative Officer).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DwayneMcDuffie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DwayneMcDuffie">Dwayne McDuffie</a> during his run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em>. Fans would blame McDuffie for every change that happened in the series, such as John Stewart's inclusion over fan favorite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Hal Jordan</a>. In response to these complaints, McDuffie started a question and answer thread on message boards, where he would answer fans' questions. It was here that he revealed a lot of roster changes were the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Editorial Interference</a>. Though, after all his comments were <a class="urllink" href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=21073">compiled<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, DC Staff were not happy and he was promptly taken off the title.

This tends to overshadow his contributions which were once widely appreciated by the fandom and had an impact on the book, which ended in 2017 after Sega of America ended their partnership with Archie and soon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">jumped ship to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IDWPublishing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IDWPublishing">IDW Publishing</a>.

In particular, Akiva Goldsman is responsible for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns">blizzard of puns</a> spouted by Mr. Freeze, despite claiming to be a lifelong Batman fan who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">particularly enjoyed the original 1989 film</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> fans blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> for everything they don't like about the franchise, except for everything after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>'s acquisition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Lucasfilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a>. There are many ways this shakes out, all of them misdirected:
<ul><li> Lucas is often blamed for story elements he had no say in. Part of this derives from him characterizing the film series as part of a grand story and taking credit for <em>everything</em> in the films, including the things people didn't like (<em>e.g.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">midichlorians</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">sand-hating</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Jar-Jar</a>). However, the same cannot be said for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a>, which he never really thought of as canon and in which he had almost no input (with a few notable exceptions like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire">Shadows of the Empire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em>). Basically, he was just the guy signing the checks. Lucas' tendency to defend his "grand vision" would bite him again in the rear end when he took credit for everything in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> was happy to let Lucas take the fall for everything people didn't like about it (excepting the infamous "nuking the fridge" scene, which Spielberg has admitted was his idea).
</li><li> Lucas is also blamed generally for killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood">New Hollywood</a> era of films driven totally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuteurLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuteurLicense">Auteur License</a>, leading the way for the theaters to be dominated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummerBlockbuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummerBlockbuster">Summer Blockbuster</a>. However, Lucas was very much a part of New Hollywood, was friends and collaborators with such auteurs as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMilius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMilius">John Milius</a>, and exerted as much control over <em>Star Wars</em> as he could.
</li><li> Kathleen Kennedy, for her part, is just a producer and doesn't really have any input into the storyline of the films. Fans blamed her for writing decisions that really should have been pinned on people like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams">J. J. Abrams</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LawrenceKasdan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LawrenceKasdan">Lawrence Kasdan</a>, and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RianJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RianJohnson">Rian Johnson</a>. In fact, some fans have turned their disdain for Lucas on its head and blame Kennedy for ruining Lucas' grand vision. A particularly strange accusation is that Kennedy forced the series to become more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">outwardly feminist</a> and/or left-leaning when it had been that way since 1977.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2sg3t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2sg3t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2sg3t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fact, according to J.W. Rinzler's <em>The Making of </em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a><em></em>, Lucas was so worried about not having enough female roles that he seriously considered making Luke a female protagonist.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardLester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardLester">Richard Lester</a>, director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII">Superman II</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIII">Superman III</a></em>, gets blamed for injecting too much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">camp</a> into the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> film series, when the blame should go to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executives</a> (are you sensing a pattern here?), in particular producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind, who insisted on the slapstick in the hopes of aping the 1960s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em> series. In fact, they brought on Lester in part because the previous director Richard Donner refused to comply with their demands. Why they insisted on this when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie">the original film</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">Doing It for the Art</a> approach made it a critical and box-office success is anyone's guess.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>, director of the 2010 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliceInWonderland2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliceInWonderland2010">Alice in Wonderland</a></em> film, gets blamed for the script deviating too much from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">the original</a> when he didn't actually write the script. That would be Linda Woolverton, who admitted in interviews that it was her goal to completely shake up the original story. In fact, Burton has never had a screenplay credit in <em>any</em> of his movies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrettRatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrettRatner">Brett Ratner</a>, director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenTheLastStand">X-Men: The Last Stand</a></em>, gets blamed for everything fans hated about the movie, when he joined the film at a relatively late stage of production and would have had relatively little creative input. Most of the legwork was done by Matthew Vaughn. Despite this, he gets a <em>lot</em> of hatred from fans for "ruining" the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries">X-Men Film Series</a></em>, just for that movie; the rest of the blame goes to former Fox president Tom Rothman. In later years it emerged that Ratner actually <em>did</em> cause numerous problems with the film's shoot — including causing the initial cinematographer to quit, and being openly homophobic towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllenPage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllenPage">Ellen Page</a> — just not the ones he's widely blamed for by fans.
</li><li> Catherine Hardwicke, director of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> film, gets blamed for the film not living up to the expectations of the rabid fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">the original book</a> when most of the film's problems were beyond her control. The lack of a budget was a particular issue, and in fact, her angling for a bigger budget got her fired from the sequel. The passing years have been kinder to Hardwicke, though, if only because the fans at least acknowledge that she was trying and didn't sign on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">just for the money</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> seems to get this a lot:
<ul><li> For directing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers Film Series</a></em>, he gets blamed for everything people didn't like about the films, when a lot of the blame should go to (take a guess) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the executives</a>, who were banking on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> series. It's particularly strange how the fans blame Bay for characters transforming into less iconic cars than they usually do when many car manufacturers didn't want their products to be featured in the films (something Hasbro had to deal with for their previous <em>Alternators</em> line where certain manufacturers not wanting their cars to be associated with "war toys" forced them to cancel or adjust planned designs). In the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">Revenge of the Fallen</a></em>, there was also a writer's strike which was completely beyond Bay's control and played a significant role in the end result. Blame for the poor writing in the second, third, and fourth films could also more properly be attributed to screenwriter Ehren Kruger.
</li><li> For being a partner in horror film studio Platinum Dunes (best known for remakes such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre2003">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th2009">Friday the 13th (2009)</a></em>), the blame for every movie they make is put on him, even though he had nothing to do with them creatively.
</li><li> For producing the 2014 reboot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2014">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em>, he gets blamed for everything in the film, even though he was just a producer and not a director (that was Jonathan Liebesman, although you'd be forgiven for missing that because Bay was billed a lot more in the promotional materials). Bay reportedly even vetoed ideas that would have likely made the film even worse-received, such as the turtles being extraterrestrials rather than mutants.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanPierreJeunet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanPierreJeunet">Jean-Pierre Jeunet</a> gets blamed for everything in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection">Alien: Resurrection</a></em> when he was brought in late into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> and ended up being thrown under the bus for the film's failure. The blame should mostly go to the studio or to screenwriter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> (who in turn blames the studio and the director). The experience caused Jeunet to swear off Hollywood, and he hasn't returned since.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFincher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFincher">David Fincher</a>, director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien3">Alien³</a></em>, gets blamed for the film, when he was brought in late to what was already a famously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> and just steered it to the finish line. Fincher had to contend with very zealous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">meddling executives</a> who tried to micromanage the production, forced him to continually rewrite the script at short notice, demanded a ton of reshoots, and even locked him out of the editing room during post-production. Fincher would later claim in an interview that if it were up to him, he would have restarted from scratch.

Some things he did have control over and were genuinely divisive and unpopular creative decisions. Others he did not, including the heavily criticized Thor subplot and the copious number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hooks</a> in the second movie — those were studio mandates. He also got some criticism for the lack of diversity in the lineup in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">first movie</a>, even though the team was decided on before he even signed on to direct.
</li><li> The Marvel executives get the blame for everything the fans don't like about the series as a whole, but the fans can't decide <em>which</em> executives should get the most blame. Some heap it all on the Marvel Creative Committee, consisting of Alan Fine, Dan Buckley, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada">Joe Quesada</a> (whom the fans already don't like much for their comic book decision-making). Others particularly dislike Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter, who made a ton of decisions to save money or angle for certain demographics — he was particularly criticized for his adherence to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto">Girl-Show Ghetto</a> (not very smart when DC's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017">Wonder Woman</a></em> became a critical and commercial success). Still, others point towards executive producer Kevin Feige, who is the chief architect and "face" of the whole franchise.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse">DC Extended Universe</a> has quite a few favorite scapegoats:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a> gets blamed for mishandling the DCEU and tarnishing the image of the franchise at its debuts given the mixed to negative reaction to the landmark films that he directed. His second movie in the franchise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em>, was particularly decried for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">very dark tone</a>, poor characterization and overstuffed plot. Snyder himself was responsible for several divisive elements in that movie like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout">Bruce Wayne's Knightmare sequence</a>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a>'s death</span>, which he added seemingly just for shock value. Other things weren't actually his fault, such as the original cut of the film missing 30 minutes (restored in the Ultimate Edition, which was better received). Furthermore, some thought he matched up poorly with screenwriter David S. Goyer, who worked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em> (although some DC fans thought he didn't respect the material either, and he didn't help matters with his infamous statements like calling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a> a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.themarysue.com/david-goyer-calls-she-hulk-sex-fantasy/">"giant green porn star"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginShaming">Virgin-Shaming</a> people who wanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> in the movies, and Jonathan Nolan is often credited as the true great writer of the <em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy). The films that followed his, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017">Wonder Woman (2017)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman2018">Aquaman (2018)</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shazam2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shazam2019">SHAZAM! (2019)</a></em> all got good-to-great critical reception (and <em>SHAZAM!</em> being the first DCEU film not to involve Snyder in any capacity). The jury is still out whether or not <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackSnydersJusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackSnydersJusticeLeague">Zack Snyder's Justice League</a></em> can change that perception.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>, who took over for Snyder mid-production on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017">Justice League</a></em>, gets more blame for everything wrong with <em>that</em> film than even Snyder. Part of it might be fans' sympathy toward Snyder (he left production after his daughter's death), and part of it was the lighter, zanier footage totally clashing in tone with Snyder's existing darker/more serious footage. Not everybody liked the gags and jokes he added either, particularly some about Wonder Woman (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunbagAirbag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunbagAirbag">Funbag Airbag</a> with Flash most notoriously, and how it was made without telling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GalGadot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GalGadot">Gal Gadot</a> about it) or the Russian family that's built up for apparently no reason since there's no real payoff to it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a> has emerged for this as many fans of the Snyder movies hold him responsible for spearheading the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> that bogged down both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016">Suicide Squad</a></em> and <em>Justice League</em> (and for scrapping Snyder's vision entirely while still cashing in on perfectly cast actors who were chosen by Snyder). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayFisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayFisher">Ray Fisher</a>'s claims of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostilityOnTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostilityOnTheSet">unprofessional</a> conduct towards the cast and crew by Johns, Jon Berg and Joss Whedon only added fuel to that fire.
</li></ul></li><li> Many fans of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">original Nickelodeon series</a> blame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan">M. Night Shyamalan</a> for everything bad related to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">The Last Airbender</a></em>, especially the controversial casting. However, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mnightfans.com/the-true-story-of-the-last-airbender-revealed/">testimonials online<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> indicate that many of the more unpopular decisions were really the product of executive interference, with Shyamalan taking full responsibility instead of admitting that he didn't have total creative control over the film. Other people have pointed out the fact that Hollywood has had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowFace">long history of systematically excluding Asian actors</a>, so it would be unfair to blame everything on Shyamalan.
</li><li> A strange case for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> franchise: A minority of fans gave every bit of praise to cinematographer Roger Deakins for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em> to the point where he's regarded as the auteur for that film, even though he never wrote the screenplay nor was he in charge of any directorial decisions. When Hoyte Van Hoytema stepped in for Deakins to shoot <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em> (which, like <em>Skyfall</em>, was also directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamMendes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamMendes">Sam Mendes</a> and written by John Logan), they doubled down on their reasonings and blamed the film's quality solely on Deakins' absence, while criticising Mendes direction for both <em>Spectre</em> and <em>Skyfall</em> to an extent. Some even blame the absence of film editor Stuart Baird, who edited <em>Casino Royale</em> and <em>Skyfall</em>. A troubled production that had nothing to do with either of them being absent on that film would say a lot about how the final product went. This would later happen again with Mendes' next film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NineteenSeventeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NineteenSeventeen">1917</a></em>; as Deakins was Mendes' cinematographer on that critically acclaimed film, his fans once again came out in force.
</li><li> After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream1996">first</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream2">two</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream">Scream</a></em> films were written by Kevin Williamson, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream3">the third</a> was written by Ehren Kruger, as Williamson was busy working on other projects at the time (specifically, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeachingMrsTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeachingMrsTingle">Teaching Mrs. Tingle</a></em> and the short-lived series <em>Wasteland</em>). His version of the film wound up diverging heavily from the outline that Williamson left him, and so many fans blame him for that film being a disappointment, ignoring the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine High School massacre</a>, and the resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll">backlash against violence in the media</a>, had forced the studio to throw out Williamson's outline (which had one of the killers from the first film surviving and orchestrating a new teenage murder spree from prison at the hands of a group of obsessive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie">Slasher Movie</a> fans) and have Kruger hastily rewrite it just a few weeks before production started. The scapegoating of Kruger really came out in force with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream4">the fourth film</a>, where some fans will blame anything they dislike about it on Kruger's rewrites even though Williamson wrote the bulk of the film. Notably, Kruger agrees with his critics to an extent, saying that not having worked with the actors on the first two films made it harder for him to remain true to their previous characterization.

For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">the numbers of the Grand Army of the Republic vs. the Trade Federation's droid army are 3 million and 4 QUADRILLION</a>, respectively. These are not Traviss' numbers, however; she was told to use them by the people in charge of canon for the Clone Wars era, and she did.
<ul><li> Perhaps as a form of irony, the former was one of the ones that first penned the clone numbers the latter is blamed for (see the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> novelization and junior novelization).
</li><li> In fact, the numbers of the droids are repeatedly questioned and written off as propaganda by several characters in her novels. And she at least tries to justify the low numbers of the Grand Army of the Republic.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Among overzealous of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> fans, Victoria Holmes gets blamed for everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">that they think is wrong with the series</a>. Insults range from calling her sexist, insulting almost every word that comes out of her mouth, and the most mindboggling of them all: Fans claiming that she steals all the credit from the other authors, despite the fact that they think she deserves to receive all the blame.
<ul><li> Their hatred of her is even more confusing since she is responsible for all the concepts and ideas behind the series, which the fans love, as well as the plotting and creating the characters.

In the new series, certain old school fans believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> personally planned his every sentence to defecate on their cornflakes (despite the fact there wouldn't <em>be</em> a new series without him).
<ul><li> The John Nathan-Turner example is particularly odd, as he was producer for a whole decade and there are nearly no fans who hate every single episode of that time. This tends to lead to slightly strained attempts to argue that Nathan-Turner had no involvement in the bits they like and was solely responsible for everything they hate. Usually, these claims boil down to something like "for the first couple of years he was finding his feet and had a lot of help, and for the last couple of years he'd given up and Andrew Cartmel did all the work." However, while a lot of this is skewed to pander to prejudices or unfairly cast blame / deny credit, there is arguably a kernel of truth here; by the late eighties Nathan-Turner had been doing the job for almost a decade and was eager to move on to other things, but for various reasons was kept in the role, meaning his overall level of enthusiasm was perhaps understandably not as high as it once was.
</li><li> Some of the 'blame JN-T / Colin Baker for everything' attitude stems from an interview Eric Saward gave to a fanzine in 1986, in which among other comments he basically called Nathan-Turner a complete incompetent and outright said that he thought Colin Baker was terrible in the role of the Doctor and should never have been cast. Plenty of fans were quick to use this as evidence that Nathan-Turner and Baker were deliberately ruining the show, apparently not stopping to consider that not only were Saward's actions incredibly unprofessional but that, as script editor, he had his own axes to grind and responsibilities for what was going on behind the scenes, both of which were curiously downplayed. Indeed, several fans have noted that the high-points of Nathan-Turner's era tend to be at the beginning and the end, when he was working with other script editors (Christopher H. Bidmead early on, Andrew Cartmel at the end), while a lot of the low-points tend to be found in the middle — when he was primarily working with Saward. It also doesn't help that many people have pointed to the scripts as the most notable weakness of the mid-80s, and that was the one thing Saward <em>was</em> in a position to fix.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3c0mq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3c0mq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3c0mq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though even then it's easy to feel for the man. His television experience before "The Visitation" was... nothing, just some radio drama. And his television experience before becoming the Script Editor, the main creative voice of the series, was "The Visitation". He was catapulted into creative direction of the series after writing a <em>single</em> serial, because Nathan-Turner wanted to avoid working with his predecessors' writers. One begins to suspect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple">The Peter Principle</a> was at work. Especially since many people think Saward showed a lot of promise as a DW writer that he never got to develop, as he never had an editor who could mentor him.</span>
</li><li> Naturally, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> took over, the official role of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> Chief Scapegoat passed to him. In addition to the old-school types who blamed Russell T. Davies for absolutely everything bad ever, they were joined by a certain subset of hardcore RTD fans who seem to feel that he destroyed everything that RTD worked for and planned every single thing he did to destroy the show and spite them personally, never mind that Moffat and RTD still fanboy over each other even after leaving the show.
</li></ul></li><li> A sizable portion of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> fandom hates and despises Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. They are referred to jointly as "Bermaga", and much of the fanbase rejoiced that those two weren't involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">the 2009 movie</a> in any way, shape or form. This has shifted a little over the years, with opinions towards Braga having improved considerably for the most part — his work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> always had a good reputation, and much of his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> work is now considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> — with most of the fan ire having moved towards Berman alone. It doesn't help Berman's case that, as the years go by, more people involved in the series have felt able to talk candidly about Berman without fear of undermining the show, revealing certain unsavoury personal aspects like homophobia and (per Terry Farrell) a fixation with female castmembers' breast size.
<ul><li> Some people hate Ira Steven Behr for taking a franchise about exploration and science fiction and turning it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">space soap opera</a>.
</li><li> Fred Freiberger inherited <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> for its 1968-1969 season. Yes, season three, which OPENED with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E1SpocksBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E1SpocksBrain">Spock's Brain</a>" and later gave us "Plato's Stepchildren". This was also the season in which their per-episode budget was cut by (approximately) sixty thousand dollars, several of the original writers had left, and the show was moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridayNightDeathSlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridayNightDeathSlot">Friday night at 10</a>. There was no fourth season. Freiberger was quoted in an interview in the mid-nineties that to the effect that he'd spent three years in a German POW camp during WWII, but that his time with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> was well into its third decade since many fans of the original series have continued to blame him for the show's cancellation.
</li><li> Gene Roddenberry himself has been spared this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">though his sudden passing may have something to do with that</a>. The two areas he had the most control of post-TOS were the first movie and the first season of <em>Next Generation</em>, both of which are reviled by most fans. Yet <em>Trek</em> fans seem to mostly forgive him for these (at least compared to what many <em>Star Wars</em> fans think of George Lucas).
</li></ul></li><li> Of both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, Joe Mallozi and Paul Mullie have fallen into this too, even so far as fans looking down on an episode <em>just because they wrote it</em>.
</li><li> Jim Mallon came in for a lot of this during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>'s run, getting a reputation as a tyrannical producer who had personal issues with just about every cast member, resulting in each of them being fired. It seems slightly more plausible when you consider that Mallon himself was the longest-running original cast member, not relinquishing the role of Gypsy until midway through the eighth season. But when you consider that people accused him of firing <em>Joel Hodgson</em>, it seems a little silly — Hodgson <em>created</em> the show, confessed shortly before his departure that he was getting a little bored with it, and agreed to come back for a cameo appearance in the final season.
<ul><li> Mallon earned a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">hatedom</a> to the point where, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CinematicTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CinematicTitanic">Cinematic Titanic</a></em> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> using most of the "fired" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">MST3K</a> cast members) released its first episode, it was reportedly released as a torrent under Mallon's name with a note to make it look like he was doing this as revenge against Joel.
</li><li> And Mallon has recently gotten heat for starting an MST3K website featuring Flash cartoons of the 'bots, voiced by a different group of actors.
</li><li> In recent interviews, Hodgson's been more candid in saying that he and Mallon had some major disagreements starting around season 4 (mainly because Mallon was pushing hard for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> and Hodgson wasn't interested), but still emphasizing that his quitting was entirely voluntary and a very difficult decision.
</li></ul></li><li> Doug Naylor gets bashed to no end for Series VII and VIII of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, which were written after the splitting-apart of his writing partnership with Rob Grant and were not as well-received as the previous six series. The lazy assumption is that Rob Grant was the source of all the best and most sophisticated humour and stories, while Doug Naylor was a lowbrow drooling deadweight leeching off Grant's success. Honestly, one has to assume they've never read Grant's <em>Red Dwarf</em> novel "Backwards", which contains more gross-out humour than all of Series VII and VIII combined.
<ul><li> A rather more charitable — if still probably somewhat simplistic — interpretation is that Grant was responsible for more of the 'comedy' aspect of the series whereas Naylor focused more on the 'science fiction'. It's notable that these seasons (and Series VII especially) tend to focus more on the science fiction concepts than the humour.
</li><li> Alternatively, it could just be that they work better as a team than apart; it's worth noting that Grant's post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> CV, while more varied and somewhat better received, hasn't exactly set the world on fire either.
</li><li> There were many factors working against Doug Naylor in Series VII and VIII, including last-minute budget cuts, the need to make the series more saleable in foreign markets, and the temporary departure of Rimmer actor Chris Barrie. Series X, produced on a low budget for cable network Dave, is generally agreed to be of a far higher quality.
</li></ul></li><li> Ryan Murphy, one of the three creators/writers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>. To be fair, he arguably screws up the worst and he appears to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator">Lying Creator</a> the most.
<ul><li> Not helping is the fact that if an artist turns down having a song on "Glee" for whatever reason, Murphy tends to...<a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/26/glee-creator-ryan-murphy-talks-masturbation-says-f-you-kings-of-leon_n_814114.html">overreact somewhat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> For fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>, everything that went wrong between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD">SPD</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersJungleFury">Jungle Fury</a></em> can be blamed on Executive Producer Bruce Kalish. It didn't help his case that, immediately after he left the show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">RPM</a></em> was made, which became an instant fan favorite.
<ul><li> Also not helping Kalish was an interview conducted early on into his taking over the reins of the show. He made himself the face of the season (in this case, <em>SPD</em>). <em>SPD</em> is generally considered a polarizing season, so the critics latched onto his earlier statement when expressing their displeasure. As he has admitted, Kalish also hurt himself by not watching <em>any</em> of the preceding twelve seasons when he took over (though that was reportedly later rectified) and being under the misconception that he was supposed to outright translate (rather than adapt) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>.
<ul><li> Kalish is slowly getting his due, though, thanks to the revelations of Disney's growing disillusionment with the franchise that led to the episode count and funding cuts and its near-cancellations, and the fact that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">cut and paste</a> tenure's looking more and more ambitious compared to the watered-down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotForShotRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotForShotRemake">translation</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em>. And Jonathan Tzachor was a base breaker in the first Saban Era...
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, got positively vilified by fans for the general shittiness of season 5, oddly enough, both for creating and for breaking up the Barney/Robin pairing. It went worse after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingAversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingAversion">the series finale aired</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> fans tend to loathe Brad Kern, who took over after Constance M Burge left between Seasons 2 and 3. He tends to be blamed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> of later seasons, despite him being responsible for the popular Cole/Phoebe pairing (which is what Burge left the show over in the first place). If you're a fan of the show, how much you loathe Brad Kern will depend on how big a fan you are of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannenDoherty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannenDoherty">Shannen Doherty</a>. Kern fired Doherty due to creative differences (she sided with Burge's vision for the show). Likewise, Alyssa Milano gets rather a lot of hate since the tension between her and Doherty was infamous. Ironically, Constance M Burge gets no hate whatsoever for being the one responsible for the near-universally despised Piper/Dan romance.
</li><li> J. J. Abrams got a lot of this from casual fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LOST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LOST">Lost</a></em> throughout the run of the series, despite only being involved for about half of its first season, and then again briefly to co-write the third season premiere. Damon Lindelof, who co-wrote the pilot with Abrams, went on to run the series with Carlton Cuse after Abrams left. Fans who were in the loop knew to blame Cuse and Lindelof for their frustrations with the series, but the news media often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">still referred to it as if it were Abrams' show</a>. (To be fair, Abrams was responsible for introducing a few of the show's earliest mysteries, and then leaving it to other writers to explain them.)
</li><li> Julian Fellowes has become this among the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em> fandom. Fans even hold him responsible for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Matthew's death, even though Dan Stevens was the one who left the show and it's generally agreed that there was no way to write Matthew out that <em>didn't</em> involve killing him</span>. Of course, they also blame him for plenty of things that <em>are</em> his fault, such as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">increasing focus on Lady Mary at the expense of other, arguably more interesting characters</a> and the fact that the soap opera quotient has been steadily rising over the past two series and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sybil's death, which - even though the actress was leaving - could have been easily avoided</span>.
</li><li> Julie Plec has gotten this since she took over as head writer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em>. Roughly half the fandom considers to be worse than a Serbian war criminal. She has been blamed for pairing Damon and Elena and accused of treating loved characters poorly (Bonnie comes to mind), and favoritism towards Damon. She has done herself no favors by making various remarks that she considers the onetime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> Damon to be a hero and believes that his needs come first. Some fans see her as being every bit as dangerous and deluded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer">Stephenie Meyer</a>.
<ul><li> And things have only gotten worse with <em>The Vampire Diaries</em>' spin-off, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOriginals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOriginals">The Originals</a></em>, which has quite the vocal Hatedom.
</li></ul></li><li> Josh Safran tends to get the "credit" for the decline of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>. During his time as showrunner, he broke up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperCouple">Chuck and Blair</a>, the couple that was the reason many fans watched the show in the first place and introduced the Dan/Blair ship instead. To his credit, he did manage to make Dan/Blair somewhat popular for a while but on the flip side, many other fans disliked the pairing to such a degree that ratings plummeted below one million per episode and never really recovered. He gained a lot of fan ire by openly admitting he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">saw Dan as a self-insert and wanted him to have the most popular female character as his love interest and for him to be the most popular character</a>, blatantly disregarding continuity in order to prop the Dan/Blair pairing and for accusing anyone who didn't prefer Dair to Chair of not being true fans of the show. In the process, he also managed to turn Blair from fan favourite to one of the least popular characters on the show. Once he was booted as showrunner a lot of efforts were taken to undo the damage but it was too late in the game and the show did about as poorly in its final season as it had during Safran's run. However, those who never shipped Chuck and Blair to begin with found it refreshing that Safran didn't make them the focal point of the series, many were pleased with the character development of Serena during his run (and, to a degree, Chuck's as well) and fans of Dan were pleased to see him getting more of the spotlight.
</li><li> According to the book <em>Brady Brady Brady</em>, since Sherwood Schwartz created <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">The Brady Bunch</a></em>, he gets blamed for lesser works he had no involvement in, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunchHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunchHour">The Brady Bunch Hour</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AVeryBradySequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AVeryBradySequel">A Very Brady Sequel</a></em>.
</li><li> If any TV show set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> fails and/or receives bad reviews (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist (2017)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inhumans">Inhumans</a></em>), everyone (even TV Tropes) will blame Ike Perlmutter. No matter the different behind-the-issues going on at Marvel Studios regarding their television branch, as far as the overzealous fans is concerned, everything is Perlmutter's fault.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> When director Alex Graves commented that including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lady Stoneheart</span> in the fourth season's finale would have been "a waste," fans blamed him for the decision in spite of the fact that he's an episode director, not a writer or showrunner, so the decision wasn't up to him.
</li><li> Following the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> and infamously underwhelming finale, it almost seems to be accepted as standard among fandom that everything good about the series was just the writers doing a copy-paste from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin">George R. R. Martin</a>'s books, and that everything bad about the series was purely the fault of creators and showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. While this is something of an over-simplification, since Benioff and Weiss made plenty of changes that fans and even Martin himself agreed were improvements, it's one that's difficult to rebut entirely, since the show's quality is widely agreed even among those who've never read the books to have gone downhill the more they deviated from them, and then totally disintegrated when they had to move beyond the books and come up with stories completely from scratch.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4u0io');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4u0io" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4u0io');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(On a similar note, some fans are fond of dragging up Benioff's being credited as co-writer on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a></em> as proof that he was a totally incompetent hack all along and should never have been allowed near the series. This ignores the massive amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> that <em>Origins: Wolverine</em> had to put up with, as well as the fact that Benioff was only one of two credited writers on that film)</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Good lord, Marc Guggenheim from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>. He is <em>the</em> go-to punching bag for everything bad happening in the series since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> that was Season 4, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">some rejoiced</a> when he left the series after Season 6 (although he returned for the final season). Never mind that Guggenheim had been in the series since the very beginning (as in, he <em>pitched</em> the series), long before the rot took place. The hatred mostly stemmed from his role as the spokesperson of the creative team, his tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator">lie</a> about plot developments in the series<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5dqp5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5dqp5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5dqp5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Notably the Black Canary's death and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Olicity</a> pairing debacle. To be fair, he admitted that the pairing wasn't handled well.</span> but also because he was the only one of the original showrunners not to depart after Season 3 (Greg Berlanti decided to concentrate on producing shows, while Andrew Kreisberg moved to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">Supergirl</a></em> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">seeing his career crash and burn after his sexual misconduct allegations were brought to light</a>). Since Season 4 was when the rot was felt in full force, the blame fell squarely on him and screenwriter Wendy Mericle, who was promoted as showrunner the same year. Thanks to this scapegoating, people tend to forget that the two still served as showrunners when the show rebounded the following season.

<ul><li> Greg Farshtey, the most prolific writer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em>. Certain fans blame him for the story's decline — they can't agree when it happened, only that it was his work. Some even falsely believe that he was a late addition to the writing team, but Greg has been there since day one; others think he was the series' head writer, but he was just one member of the Story Team. He gets complaints for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">shifting out the fantasy aspects</a>, but that decision had nothing to do with him. He's also often held responsible for enforcing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a> rule and making the story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>. While he did have a large say in the story, mostly in convincing LEGO to expand it beyond their intended single year, the direction of the main plot was always decided by the entire Story Team. Greg even commented that he was fiercely opposed to at least one story arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vakama's temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a></span>, and revealed he was the one most committed to the story and the devoted fanbase, whereas many other Lego employees thought it was disposable fluff that fans didn't care for. <br/>There is <em>some</em> merit to the complaints: alleged faults in the later years' characterizations, the writing style of the books and comics, and the entirety of the online serials were mostly Greg's doing, and he's made some controversial decisions and fan-inspired canonizations. One sour point was him not planning ahead when writing the serials (and recommending this as a writing tip to kids) and introducing major lore-changing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcons</a> on a whim. <br/>Post-2010, as more of the original franchise creators came forward to detail their contributions, the fandom's "hate" against Greg peaked and turned into a sort of joke. "Because Greg" became a stock phrase for whenever someone questions the franchise's absurdities or plot holes. Certain fans condemn the novels due to his writing while praising the comics that he <em>also</em> wrote. Others dislike many of his story ideas that clash with the fan-favorite <em>Mata Nui Online Game</em>. Despite all these, Greg still likes talking to fans and answering their questions even to this day, and a major part of the fandom still listens to his words.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>' Anthony Kiedis has got a hell of a lot of flak from fans for avoiding the band's first three albums and <em>One Hot Minute</em> live, as well as not playing the popular singles "Knock Me Down" and "Taste The Pain", meaning that the band's setlists were very static for a period. This is evidenced on the <em>Live In Hyde Park</em> album; exclusive songs notwithstanding, most of the songs are from the albums <em>Californication</em> and <em>By The Way</em>, with a couple from <em>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</em> and the Greatest Hits contribution "Fortune Faded". He seems to be aware of this, because on the <em>I'm With You</em> tour he brought back "Me And My Friends" and "Higher Ground" on a semi-regular basis, put the fan favorites "Sir Psycho Sexy" and "They're Red Hot" into the set more often and allowed Josh and the rest of the band to tease older songs that they hadn't played in years.
<ul><li> John Frusciante, to an extent has caught the flak for the band's focus on melodic balladry starting with <em>By The Way</em>. It's interesting to note, however, John's original plan for <em>By The Way</em> was to make it a punk-funk album and he was voted out by the rest of the band and Rick Rubin. <em>Stadium Arcadium</em> was partly so funky because he wanted it that way. John also catches the flak for not playing <em>One Hot Minute</em> songs live whilst in the band, but there are no real indications that he wouldn't have played them if Anthony had insisted on it.
</li><li> Jack Sherman has caught the flak for the band's first album when he actually took Hillel's place very well and taught Flea various funky techniques he didn't know before. It was the band's general lack of experience, poor choice of producer, label's lack of faith in them, and antipathy towards Sherman (due to him having the opposite of Hillel's personality) that made the album not work the way they had intended. However, he held the band together at a time when they could have broken up.
</li><li> Dave Navarro similarly gets the flak for <em>One Hot Minute</em>, but what is not realised by fans is that Anthony Kiedis was badly addicted to heroin in this period, and delayed the sessions by months, meaning that Navarro, Flea, and Chad ended up writing most of the music themselves unlike the usual jam sessions the band would have with Anthony. The music became heavier due to the fact all three band members liked heavier music, and Anthony's heroin use meant that the lyrics were darker too.

The change in musical style actually wasn't entirely on him; his bandmates also wanted to try experimenting with new musical styles, and a lot of their pop material came out after they had decided to start writing more as a group.

Usually it goes like this: if you hate John Chambers, you blame everything bad about Exalted on him and sing praises of Holden. If you don't like Holden, he gets blamed for ruining favorite topics. (That said, it is entirely possible to be sceptical about both of them, and about some of original Exalted developer Geoffrey Grabowski's decisions as well.)

<ul><li> Mike Mearls gets blamed for every decision that the fans do not like. For example, he is blamed for the 4th Edition of D&amp;D being "simplified" and allegedly focusing entirely on combat mechanics rather than roleplaying mechanics, thus making 4e "more like WoW" than D&amp;D. He's also blamed for eventually killing off 4e entirely at the behest of a "vocal minority" in favor of returning to the allegedly more cumbersome and "inaccessible" rules of previous versions and destroying the "uniqueness" of 4e. He just can't win.
</li><li> Monte Cook, his predecessor, is blamed for the "powercreep" and "Munchkining" of versions 3.x of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>.</em> Mearls stated in several design documents and blog posts that the game was designed to reward specific combinations of feats, classes, and skills, as well as setting up "traps" of sub-optimal combinations, in order to reward rule mastery. His statements about the superiority of wizards over all other classes have also earned him some blame from fans about the broken-ness of wizards in those versions.

Perhaps in response to this, rulebooks are now credited to "the Games Workshop design team" rather than a single author. Ironically, Ward himself is no longer employed at GW, with some speculation that he was made a scapegoat by his former bosses as well. He came back later, following a major shakeup in their management.

<ul><li> First played straight, but then surprisingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em>. Some uninformed reviewers blamed Team Ninja for most of the game's controversial bits when it first came out until team head Yosuke Hayashi explained that his hands were tied and series co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto was the one who insisted on, for example, the clunky control scheme. Samus' voice actress Jessica Martin got slammed for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise">Dull Surprise</a> delivery until it was revealed that Sakamoto directed her to read her lines that way. Furthermore, Martin became an active member of the fandom, even recording a Happy New Years message for the 2010/2011 New Years to the fans at the height of the backlash to her acting, and when Nintendo let <em>Metroid</em>'s 25th anniversary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenAnniversary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenAnniversary">pass without incident</a>, both she and Hayashi recorded personal congratulations messages for the series. As a result, fans started warming to Martin, and the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> focused its attention on Sakamoto.
<ul><li> ... where this trope began to be played straight. Some of <em>Other M</em>'s critics have tried to retroactively label any troubles or continuity errors in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> subseries as Sakamoto's attempts to "sabotage" the games for not fitting with his "vision" — but Sakamoto wasn't even involved in the <em>Prime</em> games, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios">Retro Studios</a> only contacted him once in a while. Some even accuse him of trying to kill the series as early as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em>, widely considered the crown jewel of the franchise, and try to de-emphasize his actual involvement in any other <em>Metroid</em> game for fear that it might paint his career and abilities in a positive light.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> fans blame Eiji Aonuma, the current main producer of the series, for every single thing that is supposedly wrong with the series nowadays. Of course, when they see something that goes right for them, then they praise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> for it. Classy, isn't it...?
</li><li> It seems like, if anything wrong happens with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a>'s fault. One of the worst cases, Ice Climbers being cut from the roster and the addition of Dark Pit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">3DS/Wii U</a></em>. People kept claiming that he was being biased for his own game series (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarus">Kid Icarus</a></em>), but Sakurai already admitted he couldn't put Ice Climbers in the game because of the 3DS hardware limitations, and Dark Pit is just a clone so it's much easier (and faster) to put in the game.
<ul><li> Many people seem to believe that Sakurai is a literal one-man team when he's often made it clear that there are other people involved in the development of <em>Smash Bros.</em> and that everything in the game has to be approved by the original teams of each series.
</li><li> Even further to point with Sakurai, people tend to always think that he does literally everything on his own for every game he has worked on, even his non-<em>Smash</em> games. There are people who will have you believe that he designed every single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a> character on his own, and did all the artwork for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em>. (The artist of this game's artwork is actually Hirooka Masaki, who previously worked on titles like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>.)
</li></ul></li><li> An arrant case is the hatred towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix">Square Enix</a> over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaCurseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaCurseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals</a></em>. The fact that Neverland <em>developed</em> the game seemed to go unheard of to most fans, who somehow believe the same team that worked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> were working on Lufia...
</li><li> Some fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> would have you believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> personally designs every single Pokémon and creates every single game. No mention of Game Freak, the company that <em>develops</em> the games. He helped produce the Generation I games and was a friend and mentor of the actual creator Satoshi Tajiri, a name that most people outside of the Pokémon fandom probably don't seem to recognize — all of which was back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.
<ul><li> On a similar note, with all of the complaints about the designs of the Pokémon and the humans themselves, you'd think Ken Sugimori was the only person on their art team. He's still on it, and he supervises the art, but the credits to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> reveal there have been at least 40 people who have done character design for the series. (This is inverted too—Sugimori will also get the credit for every compliment.)
</li><li> Nowadays, everything fans don't like about <em>Pokémon</em> tends to be put upon series director Junichi Masuda, to the point that he (and only he, mind, not any other Game Freak game directors, not the executives at TPCI, etc.) is frequently blamed for the decidedly controversial decision to not include every Pokémon in the main series games from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em> onward and accused of being a hack who is simply too lazy to include every Pokémon in the games anymore and willfully blind to what the fanbase wants out of the games.
</li></ul></li><li> Nintendo always gets yelled at for <em>not</em> having <em>[Insert Game here]</em> on the Wii's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a>, despite the fact that the submission is the original publishers' decision and permission. Nintendo merely licenses more games than it actually publishes and develops.
<ul><li> And not everyone seems to know that sometimes the publishers aren't actually still around. And sometimes, if they are, they may not <em>always</em> be second or third-party. (Sony and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare">Rare</a>, for example.)
</li><li> And back to Nintendo again, there are people who believe the company consists solely of Shigeru Miyamoto and nobody else. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a></em> (which ended up being regarded as the worst of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> series) certainly didn't help, either. A character could be written out of a game for completely legitimate reasons, and yet fans will assume the worst and call for his head.
</li></ul></li><li> If you want to be a game developer without having to deal with criticism, it's pretty much a safe bet that you should work for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> or get them to publish you. That way, any criticisms with your game will be treated like it was all <em>EA's</em> doing, even if their involvement in the game was limited to financial support and marketing at <em>best</em>. Sure, they've had their screw-ups, but they're not responsible for everything.
</li><li> Statesman, also known as Jack Emmert, former lead designer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, is pretty much the de facto hate target for anything anyone dislikes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">power changes</a>, necessary or not, game direction, AT design, you name it) until roughly Issue 13, even after Issue 7 when he stepped down to focus on other things. To this day, he <em>still</em> is reviled, and his habit of being blunt to the point of club didn't help things any.
<ul><li> This perception of him hasn't improved since he started work on another superhero MMO, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em>, which intends to compete with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>. Especially as many of the design details revealed so far indicate that he's ready to make many of the same mistakes all over again.
</li><li> Castle is rapidly becoming the new Hate Target for the playerbase, being the guy who works on (and consequently sometimes makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">downward changes</a> to) Powers.
</li><li> And now, the trope has come full circle — Matt Miller, AKA Positron, is now being blamed for everything bad about the game.
</li><li> MMORPG lead devs in general are likely to end up targets of this. It's perhaps for this reason that the lead developer of <em>Clichequest</em>, the fictional MMO in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheNoob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheNoob">The Noob</a></em>, is portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Reggie Fils-Aimé, the former president of Nintendo of America, tended to get a lot of (mostly) undeserved flack from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthbound">Earthbound</a></em> community, many of whom seem to have decided that he was the sole obstacle to an English release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>. Some fans also claimed that he was actively trying to prevent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastStory">The Last Story</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PandorasTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PandorasTower">Pandora's Tower</a></em> (the "Operation Rainfall" games) from reaching North America. Just look at the comments made on Nintendo World Report's news page about <em>The Last Story</em> being published by XSEED for a North American release... Some fans took it even further, and claim that it was all Reggie's fault that there weren't a lot of games released for the Wii in 2012, despite the fact that NOA <em>doesn't make the games.</em>
</li><li> Not one of the more high-profile examples, but there are those who blame any bad bit of level design in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a> II: Hell on Earth</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandyPetersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandyPetersen">Sandy Petersen</a>. He also worked on quite a bit of the original <em>Doom</em>, but that game is generally more highly revered than its sequel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> fans got angry at Yoshinori Ono when he revealed that not only would <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> be modeled more closely after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a></em>, but that the character roster wouldn't include any fighters from <em>SF III</em> due to the setting being a prequel. This was actually an executive mandate from Ono's supervisors, as they wanted to recapture the mainstream popularity and nostalgia of the earlier <em>SF II</em> games instead of focusing only on core players like the <em>SF III</em> trilogy. Ono eventually addressed the lack of <em>SF III</em> fighters by bringing a few of them back for <em>Super Street Fighter IV</em>.
<ul><li> Due to various fiascoes that popped up over the course of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken">Street Fighter X Tekken</a></em>'s development, it was not uncommon for fans to shovel the blame on top of Ono either. However, this mostly dissipated due to Ono's genuine zeal when it came to the titles he was working on as well as news that Ono was so overworked by Capcom that he collapsed of exhaustion and had to be rushed to the hospital (he has since recovered and is back on the job).
</li></ul></li><li> The title of scapegoat for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> seems to change every expansion. In the first few years, people generally blamed developers Jeff "Tigole" Kaplan and Alex "Furor" Afrasiabi for any and all of the game's shortcomings. In the Burning Crusade era, this title shifted to Tom "Kalgan" Chilton. Since the release of Wrath of the Lich King, however, players have been calling for Greg "Ghostcrawler" Street's head whenever they're particularly unhappy.
<ul><li> Though it has to be said that Furor and Tigole (famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a> raiders) actually *were* responsible for the shortcomings of the vanilla version because Blizzard (inexperienced with creating MMOs) put far too much faith in their judgment, thus creating an endgame that pandered solely to members of big raiding guilds and pigeonholed all existing classes into specific roles. Only with BC did all of this change.
</li><li> Ghostcrawler hate originated pretty much solely due to the now-famous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">To the ground!</a>" nerf of Retribution Paladins. Oddly enough, Ghostcrawler's existence has rather neatly bisected the community between those that dislike him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfing</a>/ruining their favourite class and those that appreciate that at least one member of the development team is supportive enough to at least publicly inform them that their favourite class will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfed</a>/ruined beforehand. That, and he is funny, which in itself is a dividing factor ("OMG be serious!"/"Hahah, cool.").
</li><li> Way back in WOW classic, Eyonix was the liaison between the shaman community and developers. Just after promising that shamans were to be reviewed and have some problems fixed, he was laid up in the hospital for weeks. Lacking his input, the developers didn't make the promised changes. He came back to the forums to face a metric ton of hostility, including a wish for him to be hit by a bus. This inspired a "Bus Shock" meme, based on the shaman's fire/frost/earth shock spells.
</li><li> Another example of misplaced blame was Tseric. Albeit he was little more than a glorified errand boy for the developers, he took lots of heat for controversial decisions he wasn't responsible for. It didn't help that he usually overplayed his own importance, made promises he couldn't keep, displayed an astonishing amount of ignorance about the classes he was supposed to represent and tried to be a snarky wisecracker towards (partially justified) complainers when it was completely uncalled for.
</li><li> A good portion of the fanbase will blame every misstep on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisMetzen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisMetzen">Chris Metzen</a>, the Vice President of Creative Development, even when it's obviously outside of his department, with the belief that he writes the entire game.
<ul><li> Dave "Fargo" Kosak, lead quest designer in <em>Cataclysm</em> and <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> and now as of <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> the Lead Narrative Designer (a new position, no one is quite sure what it entails yet), has replaced Metzen as the scapegoat for any storyline complaints. Not helping is that he is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">Ascended Fanboy</a> with all that entails.
</li></ul></li><li> Christie Golden who has written several of the tie-in novels is periodically blamed for disliked plots and characterizations. However, all of her plots and characterizations are determined by the Blizzard staff and provided in advance for her to write a story around.
</li></ul></li><li> And nowadays, almost everyone's pointing fingers at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision">Activision</a> for stuff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment">Blizzard</a></em> does. DPS Being "Dumbed down" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> by making Intellect function the <em>same way as Strength and Agility</em>, meaning Mages will actually <em>look</em> at it when determining their gear? Activision's fault! Never mind that even <em>before</em> the merge people were screaming for that.
<ul><li> Nevermind, either, that Activision-Blizzard is still essentially two distinct entities that are united on paper for record-keeping purposes. Neither group is in charge of the other, and both operate independently. The most that they share besides a letterhead is likely a pool of playtesters and artists.
</li><li> And likewise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em>'s "Always online". Look at all the comments and you'll see "It's Activision's fault." No, that was <em>Blizzard's</em> choice.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaNomura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaNomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a>:
<ul><li> Most people who voice disappointment at later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games tend to heap their scorn on Tetsuya Nomura, despite the fact that Nomura was only the character designer for most of these games and not the director. And even then, he wasn't the sole artist or even the art director for these games that he's credited with directing. They will even blame him for games he wasn't even involved in, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>. Nomura has a habit of making outrageous untrue statements in interviews which are likely meant as jokes and do not always come off as such, like his comments about his desire to turn <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIIVersus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIIVersus">Final Fantasy XIII Versus</a></em> into a musical or about how he had no idea he was the director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> until he saw the trailer. This sometimes extends to him claiming responsibility for a huge array of overall design decisions in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> series that were certainly nothing to do with him. He has said himself has said that he doesn't mind being the scapegoat because it protects the rest of the staff from the abuse, death threats, and people screaming at him in the street that they will never forgive him for killing Aerith.
<ul><li> Ironically enough, <em>FFVII</em> director Yoshinori Kitase admitted in an interview that he and writer Kazushige Nojima were originally planning to kill off most of the protagonists late in the game, but Nomura convinced them that it was a terrible idea because of how much it would upset the fans.
</li></ul></li><li> The same thing happens with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> series (though there he is at least the director), and some think he even does the art for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em>. Chew on <em>that</em> for a little while.
</li><li> This especially got bad for people saying <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> was a "Nomura game" when his involvement was drawing pictures of the characters. He did not direct it, he was not even the sole artist for the game... it even says so <strong>right there in the opening credits within the first ten minutes of gameplay</strong>. When you're talking about <em>XIII</em>, at <em>least</em> mention the game he's <em>actually</em> directing. (Eg. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em>...oops, not even <em>that</em> anymore, since he's stepped down and given the role to Hajime Tabata.)
</li><li> Nomura's seen as a pretty "bad" director because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> for so long. Actually, Disney <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">had some pretty strict rules as to how their characters could be portrayed</a> (leading to <em>Frozen</em> and <em>Tangled</em>'s plots being retellings of the movies, including shot-for-shot remakes of particular scenes), Pixar took several years to respond to the idea of their inclusion into <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> (Which Nomura <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">wanted to do as early as the first game</a>), and the fact that someone <em>higher</em> than Nomura made them scrap what they had done up to that point to swap to the Unreal Engine 4 mid-development.
</li><li> Much outrage about the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> is based around the idea that Nomura made it too "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>", despite the fact that the story decisions were made as a group with the scenario writer who wrote the part of the original game <em>Remake</em> is based on, the head writer on <em>VII</em>, and the director and co-writer on <em>VII</em>. The only person who was a major player on that part of the original who wasn't also on <em>Remake</em> is <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HironobuSakaguchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HironobuSakaguchi">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> and he gave <em>Remake</em> his blessing.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> community tends to blame all problems with the game on global online producer Sage Sundi due to him being the target of most interviews about the game. The truth is that the reason interviews are so uninformative is more due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> from the higher-ups. Sundi does know about the problems with the game and has tried to get them fixed but for the most part, the devs don't listen to him.
<ul><li> Similarly, everything wrong with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> is Hiromichi Tanaka's fault, despite who's really responsible for any of the game's many troubles between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executives</a>, the developers, and sheer misfortune being <em>very</em> muddy indeed. This is somewhat understandable given Tanaka volunteered to take responsibility for all of the game's problems (his fault or otherwise) when he stepped down as producer.. except he <em>still</em> sometimes gets loudly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">enthusiastically</a> blamed by the community for issues introduced <em>since Naoki Yoshida replaced him</em>. Yoshida also gets the blame for anything wrong in the game currently, even though the game is made by a team rather than just him.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRomero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRomero">John Romero</a> gets a lot of flak for his blunders with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana">Daikatana</a></em>. Many of them are justified, but a lot of the level design failures can instead be attributed to the head level designer (and Romero's girlfriend at the time), Stevie "Killcreek" Case.
<ul><li> Not to mention the people calling him some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">egoist</a> for the tag line "John Romero Is About to Make You His Bitch", even though that and the general exaggeration of his involvement/how much he did was more marketing than anything else.
</li><li> All of this culminating in a ridiculous event where ex-Romero fans rallied behind Ion Storm's marketing director for insulting him over the phone in an over the top way... even though the marketing director was <em>one of the people responsible for running Ion Storm into the ground and putting the game into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> You know <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2008">Prince of Persia (2008)</a></em>? If you're one of the fifty percent that didn't like it, odds are you blame or know people who blame Ben Mattes for this. For most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">true PoP fans</a> Ben Mattes has been a curse to the franchise ever since he came in with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheTwoThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheTwoThrones">Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones</a></em>, and built fan expectations for the 2008 game just so he could crush them with the actual product. The kicker? He's the producer!
</li><li> Yuji Naka may have been responsible for a number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic</a></em> quality issues during the Classic era, but he'll even get blamed for games he was clearly never involved in. A particularly egregious example of this is giving him flack for 2008's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> when Naka hadn't even been part of Sonic Team since 2005 (and had little to no involvement with any <em>Sonic</em> game since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em>).
<ul><li> Other Classic-era games Naka was never involved in: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic CD</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6j4ej');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6j4ej" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6j4ej');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Amusingly, Naoto Ohshima has said that this game (fondly remembered by fans) would have turned out even better had Naka been part of the development team</span>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogSpinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogSpinball">Sonic Spinball</a></em>, any of the 8-bit Master System/Game Gear titles, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3DFlickiesIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3DFlickiesIsland">Sonic 3D Blast</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicR">Sonic R</a></em>.
</li><li> Nowadays, the person most likely to get the blame for anything going wrong in the <em>Sonic</em> franchise is Takashi Iizuka, longtime producer for the series. However, his involvement in some of the series' worst games of Sonic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> was limited (in the credits for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic '06</a>, Iizuka's name only appears in the "Special Thanks" section).
<ul><li> If it's not Iizuka drawing the ire of <em>Sonic's</em> infamously unpleaseable fanbase, it's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dimps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dimps">Dimps</a>, the developers of all the portable <em>Sonic</em> titles since 2001. Common complaints tend to focus on the use/misuse of momentum and the overabundance of dash-pads (and cheap death). The fact that the <em>Rush</em> engine was the base for <em>Sonic 4</em> caused a large segment of the fandom to go <em>ballistic</em> even before the game was released.
</li></ul></li><li> A rather baffling case is that on rare occasion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCraigSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCraigSmith">Roger Craig Smith</a>, who's simply the voice of Sonic, will receive blame for Sonic games not living up to what the fans wanted. Much of this appears to be general rage that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">he isn't Sonic's previous voice actors</a>. Smith's immediate predecessor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonGriffith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonGriffith">Jason Griffith</a>, was a scapegoat back in the late-2000s for the same reasons.
</li></ul></li><li> Natsume is often blamed for every bad thing in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em> franchise. While their localizations do tend to have glitches the originals don't, features are sometimes taken out, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerise</a>, and their translations are far from perfect, they <em>do not</em> make the games. Marvelous does, and even then they began with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> (before it was in the hands of <em>Pack-In-Video</em> and later <em>Victor Interactive Software</em>; the latter which was eventually acquired by Marvelous).
</li><li> Ever since brought to infamy by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJNToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJNToys">LJN Toys</a> has been blamed for the (mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames">licensed</a>) games they published, even though most weren't made by them.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordKaT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordKaT">LordKaT</a> actually referenced this during one of his "Until We Win" segments, noting that one particularly bad game, although it had the LJN rainbow on the box, was actually developed by Rare.
</li><li> However, people can counter-argue that while LJN doesn't develop the games themselves, they are the ones who hire the developers and choose the budget and deadline, and it's their decision if the game is going to get published in this state or not.
</li></ul></li><li> If a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames">video game adaptation sucks</a>, gamers tend to blame either the game makers or the original IP holder. The game makers, may it be the publisher or developers, would be blamed for not caring about the property and instead uses the IP for simple brand recognition for selling as many units as possible. The IP holders would be blamed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">placing creative restraints to protect their brand image</a> or pressuring the game makers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed">rush out the product to promote upcoming events</a>.
</li><li> David Gaider is this to certain portions of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> fandom, mostly because he is the most well-known person involved with the franchise (having written the accompanying books and well as writing for the games). Despite the fact that he is a writer, he will often be blamed for programming mistakes and blamed for characters that he didn't write. When fans aren't blaming him for every fault in the story anyway.
<ul><li> A very specific case of this is when he is erroneously blamed for the lack of a dwarven romance option in the first three games.

</li><li> Much of this is because, until shortly after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, he was actually Lead Writer of the franchise, as well as his history of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Trolling Creator</a> on social media, particularly on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblr</a>.

Only time will tell if Weekes will continue to enjoy the fandom's goodwill, or if the notoriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">Unpleasable Fanbase</a> will have him replace Gaider in this trope's role too.

</li><li> The cancellation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a> 3</em> has caused absolutely no shortage of anger at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a>. Some of that anger, however, was misdirected at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiInafune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiInafune">Keiji Inafune</a>, creator of the franchise and leader of the <em>Legends 3</em> project (this being a game Inafune, himself, wanted to create for years): a major reason for the flack, according to his detractors, is that his leaving Capcom prompted them to cancel <em>Legends 3</em>.
<ul><li> Well, speaking of Inafune, the big failure of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightyNo9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightyNo9">Mighty No. 9</a></em> paved way for the disappointed fans to think that he's to blame in just about everything, even if some of it wasn't his idea (such as the disastrous "Cry like an anime fan in a prom night", that was really not his idea, but the trailer announcer's). However, Inafune admits and enforced the trope on himself, if the disappointed fans need something to blame, they should blame him. The franchise's positive reception in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightyGunvolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightyGunvolt">Mighty Gunvolt</a></em> series got the opposite reaction, with fans citing anything good from the original game that carried over to Beck's routes as entirely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IntiCreates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IntiCreates">Inti Creates</a>' ideas. Inafune instead is given credit for letting them use the game without any legal worries.
</li></ul></li><li> In the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, executive producer Casey Hudson and lead writer Mac Walters has been blamed for nearly every single of the fandom's issues with the game. This stems from a forum post by someone impersonating one of the writers and claiming that Walters &amp; Hudson were the ones behind the <em>very</em> controversial ending to the game, and didn't reveal their plans to the other writers until it was too late to change things.
<ul><li> They <em>do</em> share some of the fandom hate... with EA. Broadly speaking, there are two popular opinions: that it's entirely and solely the fault of EA's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executives</a>, or that it's entirely and solely the fault of the writers and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">Protection from Editors</a>. The two factions... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">don't get along</a>, especially because they tend to put whoever they aren't blaming on a pedestal, convinced that the game would be perfect if it weren't for those <em>other</em> guys. The DLC as well as the widely loathed endings were the most common things people blamed EA/Bioware for, though the actual responsibility (probably) falls on both parties — Casey Hudson would be to blame for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a>, and EA for the attempt to turn a very popular offline franchise into an online cash cow.
</li></ul></li><li> In the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK">SNK</a>, the illustrators and character designers Nona and Tatsuhiko "Falcoon" Kanaoka have caught <em>lots</em> of flack from people who don't like their artwork or question their decisions in regards to art and developments in the company's fighting games, specially the much-beloved <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em> series. In the case of Nona, the fans question his problems with the rest of the KOF staff in regards to his drawing style, which apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">led him to leave SNK</a> as he felt they were asking him to "simplify his style"; in the case of Falcoon, they have even been cruel enough to use the rumors about his homosexuality <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note762wr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note762wr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note762wr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(which, understandably, have neither been denied nor confirmed by him in interviews)</span> to pick apart his work as designer and producer.
</li><li> Notch, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> gets blamed for nearly any change that fandom hates. Notch had stepped down from the game back in November 2011 and had let Jeb take over, yet people will still praise or hate Notch for anything that changes in the game.
</li><li> David Goldfarb, one of the lead developers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em>, was routinely blamed for any changes made to the game that the fandom didn't like. They blamed the "downfall" of the game on David just because of his previous involvement with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a></em> games, and how David said he had some influence on the developers during the alpha stages of <em>PAYDAY 2</em>. However, most changes made to the game are decided by the development team as a whole rather than just one or two people.
<ul><li> After Goldfarb's departure from Overkill Software in July 2014, Marketing Director and Producer Almir Listo became the community's new target, due to his appearance in most update/behind the scenes videos, and his communication with the fanbase in general.

Ask who caused the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>: Tomm Hulett, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a>. To one half of the fanbase, Hulett, the man who took over as the director of the series after the original development team, Team Silent, disbanded following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4TheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4TheRoom">the fourth game</a>, was responsible for everything that went wrong with the series from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins">Silent Hill: 0rigins</a></em> onward, from questionable creative decisions to changes in gameplay mechanics to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a> that was the <em>Silent Hill HD Collection</em>. To the other, Hulett has been the only person keeping the series alive, and it was Konami that broke up Team Silent and passed the franchise off from studio to studio while destroying everything that made the original games great. The only thing they can agree upon is that the series went downhill after Team Silent broke up, and that <em>someone</em> is to blame. <br/><br/>The Hulett-bashing has, however, mostly gone dormant and shifted to a focus on Konami ever since the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHills">Silent Hills</a></em> debacle. Pretty much <em>everybody</em> agrees that that mess was Konami's fault, especially in the wake of their abandonment of most AAA game development in 2015-16 to focus on mobile gaming and slot machines. While Konami's fraught relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, the director of <em>Silent Hills</em>, tends to be portrayed as a one-way street a bit too often (Kojima had gone seriously overbudget on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>, putting him very much in Konami's bad graces), Konami's announcement of a <em>Silent Hill</em> slot machine just months after they canceled <em>Silent Hills</em> read like a deliberate insult towards the franchise and its fans.

Many have blamed publisher Froggo Games for <em>Karate</em>, as they're the company that released the most common version of the game in 1987, but in reality, they just re-released a far rarer Ultravision title from 1983, similarly to what they did for all of their other 2600 games. This lifts much of the blame and explains why the graphics were so bad for a "1987" release, though one could still blame Froggo for making such a bad game more common.

The most infamous example is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a> status of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half Life 3</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>, where Gabe is accused of intentionally delaying the game because people are making fun of his weight. In 2014, an indie developer accidentally had his title released on Steam as an Early Access title, even though it was finished. He became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">furious</a> and tweeted a death threat to Gabe Newell, which caused a lot of controversy and got Valve to take his game off Steam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata">and cut all future relations with him.</a>

It's not uncommon for players to paint "Geko" as a Federation-loving, DPS-only man who is ready to snub the Klingon and Romulan player bases at every opportunity and if someone dares challenge his way of thinking, he'll gladly find a way to harm the player base, usually with more grinds.

<ul><li> Yoshinori Ono was once again blamed for Capcom's side of the roster being seen as weak and mostly just rehashes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em>, even though he had nothing to do with the game. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/YoVideogames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/YoVideogames">Maximilian Dood</a>, part of the blame really deserves to go to Capcom Japan for not understanding the Western fanbase; for example, they keep including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Frank West</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando">Spencer</a> in the series because they think Americans are much fonder of the characters than they actually are, and for a very long time let the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> series fall by the wayside simply because they didn't think American and European fans liked it very much when it is and always has been one of their most popular franchises.
</li><li> Plenty of fans blame Capcom as a whole for the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a> isn't a top-tier character, saying it was just another example of them trying to screw over the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> franchise out of spite. Never mind the fact that X's partner Zero, who was already a top-tier character in <em>MvC3</em>, is <strong>even better</strong> in <em>Infinite</em> to the point of being considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> by some...
</li><li> Making his fourth appearance on the page, Marvel's Ike Perlmutter gets a lot of blame for the game being "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> vs. Capcom", with <em>Infinite</em> dropping the comic book aesthetic of <em>MvC3</em> in favor of a more realistic art style<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note83ejv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note83ejv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note83ejv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which, combined with Capcom's more anime-styled characters, produced some major examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a></span>, replacing the iconic background music with more generic "theatrical" tracks, and demanding that the entire Marvel side of the roster (with the lone exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nova">Nova</a>) are characters who've either appeared in or will be appearing in the MCU. Not helping matters is the fact that this meant the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> characters, who have been mainstays of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVs">Capcom vs.</a></em> franchise since the start, with Capcom admitting that their hands were tied and the best they could do would be <em>maybe</em> getting those characters back as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a>.
</li><li> Pete "Combofiend" Rojas, a member of the FGC and the community manager for <em>Infinite</em>, took a ton of heat for the infamous "Functions" interview which was full of absurd statements (such as "Modern gamers don't really know who the X-Men are" and "People play fighting game characters for how they function, not their appearances or history"). The general feel of the interview is that Rojas had to address the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom">Elephant in the Living Room</a> while also trying to avoid saying anything that could piss off Marvel like blaming them for the lack of X-Men characters. However, "Functions" ended up becoming a derisive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">meme</a> for <em>Infinite</em>, and a few players blamed Rojas for the game's roster, even though he was simply the community manager and thus had absolutely no input into the game.

<ul><li> Gameplay-wise, lead designer Geoff Goodman is heavily disliked by the community for some comments that were dismissive toward fans of D.va (after she received a heavy nerf), for another comment that implied he wanted to remove/replace D.va with another character filling her niche and another dismissive comment toward the Ana fiasco.
</li><li> Lead writer Michael Chu has received this treatment from a <em>very</em> vocal portion of the fanbase that he might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">never live down</a> as a result of some conflicting choices with the lore, including its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">incredibly slow pace</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconing</a> of the lore here and there, supposed favoritism of certain characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">supposed favoritism of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueRomance">Mercy/Genji</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat">over other ships</a>, etc., to a point where when Alyssa Wong was announced to join the team as a lead story writer, bashing Michael Chu was practically the go-to response while hoping that Wong will do better. On the other hand, Chu is still the story director and writer for most of the <em>very</em> well-received characters, comics, and animated shorts that have been released, and it's often forgotten that his status as a writer doesn't make him fully in control of how Blizzard develops the rest of the game, which is a multimedia project with concurrently-developed aspects beyond his field, including that of animations, comics, and other supplementary lore videos.

This is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon">Lolicon and Shotacon</a> content, unlike Child Pornography, falls under the protection of the US American constitution as artistic expression, but in countries like Australia or the UK they are considered the same thing, thus illegal. So to get the game sold officially at all and not make their customers risk their own lives, Jast USA had to remove that content. Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that Jast made the most money by selling articles of Kokoro herself and still did after the game's release.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a> is widely blamed for the failures of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRippingFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRippingFriends">The Ripping Friends</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">Ren and Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon</a></em> — ignoring that the former show suffered from horrific meddling (which included throwing out all of the custom poses that Spumco is known for), and the latter show was pushed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> due to Spike TV wanting it to be another moneymaker along the lines of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>.
<ul><li> As for the original <em>Ren and Stimpy</em>, Bob Camp was the major scapegoat for getting John fired from the show. Some former Spumco artists claimed that Nickelodeon gave him a higher raise. Alternatively, there is the other side that claims that John was fired because he didn't finish the episodes in time.
</li></ul></li><li> Showrunner Mike Scully is usually blamed for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>' nadir in quality and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">characterization</a> in seasons 9-12. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">Of course, the fans have been saying the most recent season is the worst ever more or less since the series began</a> (Comic Book Guy's catchphrase "worst episode ever" was coined in relation to <em>The Simpsons</em> in response to a fourth season episode, the fourth season now being considered to be something of a Golden Age). Also, the last episode he wrote was "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation" - which first aired in <em>2002</em>.
<ul><li> Creator Matt Groening also gets a big heap of blame from unhappy fans. The primary complaint is that he should have ended the show years ago. But Matt was complaining as early as season 5 that how long <em>The Simpsons</em> continues is totally out of his hands. He doesn't have the power to end the show and never did. That's Fox's call. He instead went on to create <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> and be heaped with praise for taking a more hands-on approach.
</li><li> Current showrunner Al Jean gets a lot of blame for the latest quality drop, especially considering the fact that he has <em>been</em> the showrunner for over seven years, far longer than anyone else, not to mention that Al Jean was, with then-partner Mike Reiss, showrunner on Seasons 3 and 4, as well as some episodes produced on the side for Season 6 when they did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> and Seasons 8 &amp; 9 when they did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenAngel">Teen Angel</a></em> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>. Jean decided to return to <em>The Simpsons</em> in Season 10 when he felt he wanted to return to the show, and Reiss has since returned to <em>The Simpsons</em> as a co-producer.
</li><li> There's a small but very vocal group of fans that blame writer Ian Maxtone-Graham for the show's decline, as he joined the writing staff around the time of the decline and admitted a few years later that he had barely seen the show before being hired. This despite Maxtone-Graham only writing one or two episodes per season, and these episodes generally being considered among the better post-decline episodes.

His strong online presence at the time backlashed (in part thanks to the jerkass admin of his message board) into him getting most of the blame, while his writing partner Marty Isenberg, who keeps a low profile, was spared most of the flak (and went on to be the head writer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a>).

Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> in particular seem to believe the show is superior and that this is because Seth has checked out of it. That's not true, obviously: he has equal power over all three shows.
<ul><li> You know "Not All Dogs go to Heaven"? The one that's most criticized here for being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> for Macfarlane? <a class="urllink" href="http://familyguy.wikia.com/wiki/Not_All_Dogs_Go_To_Heaven">Yeah, he neither wrote nor directed that episode.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Same with the second-most-criticized episode, <a class="urllink" href="http://familyguy.wikia.com/wiki/Road_to_the_Multiverse">"Road to the Multiverse".<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Both episodes were directed by Greg Colton, and the writers of "Heaven" and "Multiverse" were then-showrunner Danny Smith and Wellesley Wild, respectively.
</li><li> Whether or not he's credited as writing or directing an individual episode isn't as important as one might think. As the executive producer, he oversees the creation of the scripts and approves them before they enter into production, sometimes rewriting them. That said, the original writer(s) tend to escape any blame in favor of targeting Seth.
<ul><li> Also, it is not uncommon for a showrunner or producer to do rewrites or make contributions to an episode but forgo a formal writing credit.

While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail">Fievel Goes West</a></em> is sometimes considered watchable (partly due to nostalgia reasons), all the other stuffespecially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH">The Secret of NIMH</a> 2</em>is often blamed on him. Other than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BartokTheMagnificent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BartokTheMagnificent">Bartok the Magnificent</a></em>, Bluth had nothing to do with any of these sequels. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note01jnw');"><sup>Funny fact </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note01jnw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note01jnw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Bluth once said that if he ever <em>did</em> direct a follow-up to <em>Secret of NIMH</em>, he listed a few ideas that were present in the actual sequel, but flipped aroundi.e. he wanted <em>Timothy</em> to be the villain and <em>Martin</em> to be the protagonist.</span>

More moderate members of the fanbase recognize that the decision wasn't entirely his and that at worst all he can be blamed for is trying to cram too much material into a single episode.
