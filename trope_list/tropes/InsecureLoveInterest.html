<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>:
<ul><li> Belldandy is this way towards Keiichi Morisato. Numerous times things happen that make it seem as if he's losing interest in or cheating on her, and she more or less ends up asking if she's good enough. And every single time, he promises her that she is, considering the wish he made to her in the first episode/chapter ("for a girl like her to stay with him forever" after being rejected by another woman), he doesn't intend to betray her trust.
</li><li> Keiichi himself is probably an even better example of this, particularly in the anime. He's quite aware that he is — especially in the beginning — an unattractive loser, and that by staying with him, Bell is taking a <em>big</em> step down. He often feels guilty for tethering her to him when he knows she could find someone better. The fact that <em>both</em> sides in this relationship are like this is one of the major contributors to the series' infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">Cannot Spit It Out</a> dynamic.
</li><li> Belldandy also believes that she doesn't deserve Keiichi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because she has been aware from day one of their relationship that Heaven messed with Keiichi's mind to keep him from consummating their relationship.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts">Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts</a></em> despite how much he may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend">deny feelings for</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">run away from</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Shouko</a> and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">advances</a> on a frequent basis, when Yuuji actually talks about his relationship with her, he makes it out like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMe">it's all his fault that she's fallen in love with a worthless guy like him</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Yuuji:</strong> <em>I want to set her free.</em>

</li><li> As someone who doesn't excel at anything, Hajime Hinata in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> has a massive inferiority complex that makes him feel unworthy to be around Chiaki Nanami, one of the top elite. Despite her constant reassurances that she likes him as he is and he doesn't need talent, he still wrestles with thinking he doesn't deserve to stand by her side. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's sadly unable to overcome this and turns himself over to human experimentation, hoping to be made into someone "better". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">He gets the talent</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">and loses</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">everything else</a>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Yumi</a>'s ex-boyfriend Haneda is still in love with her but believes that he is unworthy of Yumi until he can win all seven professional shogi title tournaments.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Takagi</span> sometimes shows shades of this trope towards his girlfriend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sato</span>. At some point he's seen in tears due to this, thinking of how he believes himself to not have what it takes to make her happy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then he's kidnapped and put in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Krillin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>. Even after he married 18, he still wonders why she chose him and still is worried about if he is worthy of her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>, Louise continues to worry that Saito is only with her because he's her familiar, in spite of the multiple times he tells her that he loves her. To be fair to her, though, Saito can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">rather easily distracted</a> by the other girls in his harem.

Despite their love being blatantly reciprocated, Issei was - for quite some time - resigned to the mindset that she, a bonafide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> with a noble heritage, deserves better than a perverted guy like him. This, however, causes Rias to remain heartbroken when Issei answered her question on what she really is to him: he said she's nothing more than the president of the Occult Research Club and his master. It took the support of the other girls to let Issei battle with his inferiority complex - caused by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFirstCutIsTheDeepest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFirstCutIsTheDeepest">trauma involving being killed on his first date by his ex-GF for being boring</a> - and successfully hook up with Rias.
</li><li> Both of the lead characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> apply, though for different reasons.
<ul><li> Kaguya, for all her riches, intelligence, looks, and popularity, feels that her past as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">Ice Queen</a> makes her unworthy of being in love with the kindhearted Shirogane.
</li><li> Shirogane feels inferior to Kaguya but wants to stand beside her as an equal. He studies desperately so that he can outdo her in at least one field but is very worried that she'll beat him one day. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's also the very reason he wants to have her confess to him: if he confesses and she ends up rejecting him, he feels that he'll never end up closing the already wide gap between them. His self-esteem was already shot because of his mother abandoning him thus he feels that no one can love him for who he truly is.</span>
</li><li> Kaguya (Ice) turns this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> compared to regular Kaguya, given the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostInTheMachine">she's the mental representation of everything that Kaguya hates about herself</a>. The only reason her complete lack of self-esteem isn't obvious at first glance is that she's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">Ice Queen</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad">Kimagure Orange Road</a></em>: Main character Kyosuke is in love with Madoka, but he thinks he isn't and will never be good enough for her. He thinks that she's beautiful, intelligent, mature... and compared to her, he looks like a kid.
</li><li> Setsuna from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> spends a considerable amount of time angsting over how she feels unworthy of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">Ojou-sama</a> Konoka. In fact, most of the girls in this series are pretty insecure towards their crushes in some way.
</li><li> Mametarou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MassuguNiIkou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MassuguNiIkou">Massugu ni Ikou</a></em> is a mutt. After learning his girlfriend is a purebred Kishu, he starts feeling insecure in himself due to "just" being a cross.
</li><li> Snow gives hints of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR">MÄR</a></em>. Aside from the occasional jealousy, it doesn't go anywhere. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's heavily implied she hooks up with Ginta at the end anyway.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MayoChiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MayoChiki">Mayo Chiki!</a></em>, due to the nature of her situation, Subaru, who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">girl disguised as a boy</a>, is constantly worried that she either isn't good enough for Jiro or that he's either dating or likes someone else.

</li><li> Both halves of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLoveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLoveStory">My Love Story!!</a>'s</em> main couple experience this.

So, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, it never occurs to him Yamato might reciprocate his growing feelings and he instead tries to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMatchmaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMatchmaker">The Matchmaker</a> with her and Suna. This persists until Suna engineers a confession out of Yamato with Takeo in earshot. He's much better afterward, but self-aware enough of his faults that he's hesitant to make any big moves without first consulting Suna.
</li><li> Post-Upgrade, Yamato worries about being good enough for Takeo. Takeo's more old-fashioned values and putting Yamato on a pedestal cause her to worry that he will reject her because she desires to move their relationship forward; even with something as simple as holding hands. She also experiences some low key possessiveness because she can not comprehend that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonky</a> Takeo isn't typically popular with girls and frets about having to fight for him. Fortunately, once he's aware of these issues himself, Takeo assures her he'll be glad to move faster if that's what Yamato wants and that he loves her and only her.

<ul><li> While Naruto never gets into a romantic relationship with Sakura, he stated to Sai that he couldn't tell her he had a crush on her if he couldn't keep his promise to her, so he seemed to imply that he was unworthy of her. However, after Chapter 469, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">he completely stopped being like this to her</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/8793565/chapters/20159878">How the Light Gets In<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> features a rare mutual example. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Dean</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Laurel</a> are completely in love with each other, think the other person "saved them", <em>and</em> see one another as the perfect parent; and, due to long-standing insecurities and self-loathing, they see themselves as wholly unworthy of the other's love, and as a mediocre (at best) parent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Evelyn and Solas</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WalkingInCircles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WalkingInCircles">Walking in Circles</a></em> are this toward each other. For Evelyn, once the canon events start and theyre officially together, she often displays doubt about herself due to her experience <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as a Tranquil</span>, not being able to control her emotions or use her magic. She also sees herself as physically unattractive, being extremely underweight due to not being able to take care of her health properly for two years. Solas always quickly assures her that he still finds her very desirable and that any hesitation on his part is only out of concern that he may hurt her.
<ul><li> Solas, at least in the beginning, often tells her that she should run away to find a quiet and safe place to live and let him deal with everything, as he doesnt want her to suffer for his mistakes. Even when theyre together and hes accepted that shes not going anywhere or leaving him alone, Solas still believes that Evelyn could have a better and simpler life without him.
</li></ul></li><li> The first story in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SkyholdAcademyYearbook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SkyholdAcademyYearbook">Skyhold Academy Yearbook</a></em> series has two, though they're insecure for very different reasons. One sees himself as a broken thing, and he doesn't want the woman he loves to pity him or think she has to fix him. The other, who manages to keep his feelings an extremely well-hidden secret for a long time, blames himself (not unreasonably) for a tremendous misfortune which has befallen his love interest.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheApprenticeTheStudentAndTheCharlatan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheApprenticeTheStudentAndTheCharlatan">The Apprentice, the Student, and the Charlatan</a></em>:

It comes to a head during a date, in which Nova can't help but wonder exactly why Twilight would want him out of everyone else, and she dismantles every self-criticism he has in one long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a> speech.
</li><li> Later, once Nova has finally confronted and admitted his feelings for Twilight, the roles are flipped, with Twilight wondering why Nova would come back for her when she refused to hear him out after some meddling from their enemy. Nova showcases his own growth and deconstructs all of Twilight's self-criticism. This marks the moment where they become a true couple within the fic.
</li></ul></li><li> Very common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> fics. Jaune/Pyrrha are probably the most common, but Blake/Yang are a close second, and it certainly shows up in other pairings.
<ul><li> <em>at least it was here</em>: Jaune can't believe that Pyrrha would ever care for him as more than a friend, and Pyrrha assumes that since Jaune has never said anything he just sees her as a friend.

Nora, the only one who knows about their relationship, facepalms repeatedly over this. <em>Everyone</em> knows they're in love with each other, but no one wants to interfere.
</li><li> Used darkly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FlamesShade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FlamesShade">Flame's Shade</a></em> when Weiss can't fathom Pyrrha's feelings for her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WeissReacts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WeissReacts">Weiss Reacts</a></em>: Jaune is sure that he isn't worth Pyrrha's attention because he himself isn't a badass.

Leonard developed a crush on Penny the first time they met but never asked her out (until the season one finale) because he felt that she was out of his league.

One of the reasons he's hostile to protagonist Dipper Pines is because he sees him as a threat to his relationship to Wendy, the girl they both like... despite Dipper being a young boy <em>just</em> starting puberty while he and Wendy are teenagers. Speaking of, Dipper does prove to be the reason why Wendy breaks up with him; not because she's interested in him, but because Dipper managed to discover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlMusic">another reason</a> to end a relationship with someone she was already on the fence being with (she was going to break up with Robbie at the beginning of the episode for being a bad boyfriend, but gave him another chance).
