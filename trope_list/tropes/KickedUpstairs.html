</div></div><p>Sometimes someone working for an organization cannot be eliminated, but isn't actually wanted in his role. Perhaps he's far too eager but incompetent, or is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">good but has some crazy ideas</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">just annoys everyone</a>. Maybe the only reason he has this role is that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">the boss' nephew</a>, and he's terrible at the actual job. Maybe he can't be fired because of some complicated union situation, or because employment law heavily favors the employee rather than the employer in this setting. Rather than being eliminated normally, he can get "promoted" beyond the point where he gets to do anything damaging or given a role that serves no useful functions. Or he can be given a "vitally important task" that really isn't worth the effort (and may even be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt">Snipe Hunt</a>). Alternatively, the role assigned might be significant, but the main advantage of putting the character there is that it would be a long way from anyone else you care about.

This is the most benign fate of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a>: He goes from incompetently micromanaging your every task to incompetently giving vague company mission statements.
</p><p>If the first thing we see of a character is him being kicked upstairs, you can bet that his job is about to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>.
</p><p>In his book <em>The Peter Principle</em>, Dr. Laurence J. Peter called moving an incompetent employee to one of these jobs "Percussive Sublimation." This is closely related to the "Lateral Arabesque," in which the incompetent employee is kicked <em>sideways</em>, instead of up; either way, the personnel in question get shuffled over into a new position of theoretically equal status (if not higher), but which doesn't have nearly as much effect on the situation.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Japanese firms call people assigned to this <em>madogiwazoku</em> (literally "by-the-window tribe"), assigned to what seems to be a position of prestige and respect for a venerable company elder that has no real power or subordinates, except to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplativeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplativeBoss">look out the window</a> and wait to retire or die. These positions are usually looked upon with disdain by both other people within the company and the people assigned to them. In Japan's workaholic society, this position is essentially forced pre-retirement (when retirement is basically viewed as one step short of death) and generally leads to boredom and low self-esteem from not being a valuable part of the company (and, by extension, society).
</p><p>In the Soviet bureaucracy, the phrase was <em>otfutbolit na cherdak</em> ("kick up to the attic").
</p><p>The name of the trope comes from British politics, where the "Upstairs" in question is the House of Lords. Being given a title like "Lord" or "Baroness" sounds like a great reward for a career in politics — until you realize that it disqualifies you permanently from sitting in the House of Commons, where all the real decisions are made (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> was offered a Dukedom after WWII, but he turned it down so he might become Prime Minister again, and also so his eldest son could pursue a career in politics).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em> popularized the phrase in recent times. But it dates to 1684, when the post of Lord President was given to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Hyde,_1st_Earl_of_Rochester">Laurence Hyde, First Earl of Rochester<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after his mismanagement of the country's finances. His contemporary Lord Halifax commented: "I have seen people kicked down stairs but my Lord Rochester is the first person that I ever saw kicked up stairs".
</p><p>A similar term, applied more to the office itself than the person being "promoted" to it, is "sinecure", for a job that involves little or no actual work. It comes from the Latin <em>sine cura</em>, "without care"; the term originated in the medieval church, where it meant a job for a priest that did not directly involve ministering to souls, such as being a bishop's secretary, but also a job with no real duties. Of course, not all promotions or appointments to a sinecure are examples of being Kicked Upstairs, but depending on what the person's old job was and their employer's motives for putting them there, they certainly can be. The "deputy leader" post in most governments (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">Vice President of the United States</a>) is widely considered one of these, therefore leading to the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicePresidentWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicePresidentWho">Vice President Who?</a>.
</p><p>May or may not include being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Reassigned to Antarctica</a> in the process. Often leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">Reassignment Backfire</a> (and as mentioned earlier, if the character is important or this is how we first see them then this is practically guaranteed). A supernatural version of this can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>. When the kicking is done by a family member, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">Nepotism</a>. Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToScapegoat">Promoted to Scapegoat</a>. For the competent but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">non-action-oriented</a> position of authority, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey">Desk Jockey</a>.

The fact that Centaurs in the <em>Potter</em> universe are staunch isolationists means that the Liaison Office doesn't actually <em>do</em> anything, and being "sent to the Centaur Office" is a Ministry euphemism for being sacked.
</li><li> Plus, there seems to be little interaction between different Wizard nations, which makes the Department for International Magical Cooperation seem fairly useless. Barty Crouch was put in charge of this Department (ostensibly a demotion from his previous position as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, though going from the Head of one department to the Head of another saves face) after the debacle of his son being allegedly involved in Death Eater activities, in order to save the Ministry embarrassment. Similarly, when Cornelius Fudge is thrown out of office after his suppression of information suggesting the return of Lord Voldemort, he is given a meaningless "consultation" position, which seems mostly intended to keep him out of the way. Fudge may or may not actually fit this bill; he seems to be universally despised, so there likely isn't much pressure to keep him around.

After a particularly controversial violation of the Prime Directive (for the purposes of saving a civilization from destruction), Kirk became a household name. His career was dissected in the media to the point where his reputation — as both a hero and a troublemaker — was blown out of all proportion. Half of Starfleet Command wanted him dismissed from the service, the other half idolized him. Admiral Nogura eventually solved the problem by promoting Kirk, acknowledging the good of his actions while keeping him behind a desk, and so out of trouble. It seemed the safest compromise.

It ends reasonably happily, however, since when the capable man finally gets sick of the situation and resigns, the mix-up means that the incompetent's pay gets slashed as he goes on the capable man's retirement pension, while the capable man keeps receiving full pay; since the incompetent has been utterly bewildered by his rise in status he assumes that he's just been found out and justly punished, so doesn't question it.

Unusually for this trope, the man is <em>thrilled</em> — traffic cops almost never have to work overtime and then get woken up at 3AM to come back in so they can respond to a crisis, events that happened several times a week in Unearthly Forces. Since the promotion came with a real rank increase, he got a raise out of the deal. And since he's only a few years away from qualifying for a pension, the fact that the traffic department is a career dead-end doesn't matter that much to him. When his boss realizes that they really do need a UF specialist, he categorically refuses to take the job back, and insists that they pick someone else.

So he "promotes" the captain to a staff position so he can focus on a study to examine the fleet's logistical requirements and what they need to get home, leaving the tedious and dreary work of ship (and, as seniormost surviving commander of the auxiliaries, squadron) command to his subordinate.

Lockwood and Co. assume this is the first step in his moving on to greater things, but it turns out that afterwards he's being given a lot of bad assignments and generally on the outs. It turns out that they thought he showed a bit too much independence for their liking during the Chelsea affair, so they kicked him upstairs. He finally has enough and ends up quitting.

It's essentially a punishment posting to keep her out of the way, albeit one that brought with it a promotion, and for bonus points, the cultural differences mean it's basically fine-tuned to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">Ironic Hell</a> to the Radchaai.

Radchaai have a lot of rituals related to tea; the Geck have objections to water being boiled, and mostly drink lukewarm salt water. She doesn't have anything important to do while there, either; the Geck are the most insular species in the galaxy, view most of the universe as a sort of howling abyss of perpetual misery and chaos, and as such they tend not to be involved in diplomatic crises. Finally, the Radchaai diplomatic machinery won't let her resign.

<ul><li> In one episode, a worried Hacker contemplates his future during a reshuffle being kicked into a "useless non-job" (like Lord Privy Seal or Minister for Sport). He's also threatened with a specially-created role of "Minister for Industrial Harmony" in one episode, the position's primary responsibility being to take the blame every time there's a strike, but that probably crosses into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Reassigned to Antarctica</a> territory.
</li><li> A running joke throughout the series is that almost every politician is terrified of being sent up to the House of Lords, it being the ultimate kiss-of-death for a political career.
<ul><li> In one episode, Hacker asks a friend what its like to have moved from the Commons to the Lords, to which the friend sardonically replies "[It's] like moving from the animals to the vegetables."
</li><li> Another one had a reference to a politician being kicked upstairs due to falling asleep in Cabinet. When Humphrey asks whether this is normal he is told this happened <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">while he was talking.</a>
</li><li> Another example is when Hacker is set up by a rival to take the responsibility for axing his own department in its entirety. Said rival gloats: "I expect he'll be sent to the Lords. Lord James Hacker of Kamikaze..."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Special</a> "Party Games" had the Home Secretary kicked upstairs for drunkenly ramming into both a truck carrying nuclear waste and the car of a reporter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">right after having been behind a "don't drink and drive at Christmas" campaign</a>.

</li><li> In the episode, "The Bishop's Gambit", Sir Humphrey is offered the position of Master of Baillie College upon the current Master's retirement, which is about the same time as Sir Humphrey's planned retirement from the civil service. The only stumbling block? The Dean hates him and would block it from happening. So Sir Humphrey manipulates circumstances so that the Dean gets offered a bishopric. With the Dean out of the way, Sir Humphrey's future is now brighter and he even scored points for being "selfless" by recommending someone with whom he shares a mutual dislike.

However, as Gareth is a humourless jobsworth who craves any hint of authority, no matter how inconsequential, he absolutely revels in it.
</li><li> It's also likely that this is the reason the partners of Wernham-Hogg wanted to promote David Brent to the position of UK manager, while his more competent Swindon counterpart would take over running the newly merged branches. David only doesn't get the promotion because he fails the medical exam.

This job title was a meaningless honorific which seemingly involved no real duties except those delegated by Michael because he didn't want to do them himself (such as scheduling the weekend workers or picking a health care plan for the office). He retained absolutely zero extra authority and was paid the same as any other salesman, but he routinely left out the "to the" in his title and behaved as if he was second in command.
</li><li> Gabe is initially he is only there to oversee the merging of regional offices, but afterwards is asked by Jo to stick around and supervise for her. His only real job is letting her know what's going on at that branch, but he has no authority whatsoever. He cannot hire people, fire people, or even perform disciplinary action.

After Gowron proves clone-Kahless is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">the strongest warrior of them all</a>, the spiritual rebirth sparked by his return is still seen as a political threat. Instead of killing clone-Kahless and making him a martyr to his followers, Worf suggests installing him in the currently empty ceremonial but politically powerless seat of Emperor, as the "true heir" to Kahless.
</li><li> Being kicked upstairs is basically how Dr. Beverly Crusher was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> for the second season, as head of Starfleet Medical. Fortunately the bus ride only lasted one season.

It turns out he really is a good engineer under the right conditions, i.e. when he isn't paralyzed by his social problems.
</li><li> Trying to avoid this is how Riker ended up being Picard's XO for over fifteen years. He was repeatedly offered commands of his own, but kept turning them down because he felt being the XO of the flagship was more prestigious than captain of a small cruiser. Many people take issue with this, because he is effectively stalling the careers of those under him in doing so, with particular regard to Data. The Novelverse has him undergo a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> on this matter, which is how he ends up taking the post of the USS Titan.

However, the Prophets decided that he was their new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">messiah</a> (a long story that's actually far more complicated than that) and the whole thing turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">Reassignment Backfire</a> against <em>himself</em>.

A devil starts out as a mindless weak creature known as a Lemure, but through time and patience can be promoted to more intelligent and powerful forms. Since devils are natural schemers, they tend to plot against and backstab their superiors a lot. If a devil's superior wants to be rid of him, but can't come up with a good reason for punishment, he may instead promote him to a stronger but less intelligent (and thus less troublesome) form. Devils call this "lateral demotion". Although devils love gaining more might, they hate the thought of becoming dimwitted brutes incapable of plotting against others, so lateral demotions are considered undesirable.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader">Rogue Trader</a></em>, this is a common explanation for how the eponymous Trader received his Warrant of Trade, which empowers its holder to go beyond the reaches of Imperial space and basically do whatever the heck they like there. Frequently, a Lord Militant, Inquisitor, or Administratum Adept will begin amassing too much power for the comfort of his superiors and rivals, but be too powerful to be safely assassinated. Solution: grant him a Warrant of Trade. It's way too big an honor to be turned down, and will keep the Trader well away from the corridors of power for the foreseeable future. (Of course, since a competent Rogue Trader can rapidly acquire both a personal empire and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">more money than seems reasonably possible</a>, this tactic also has a tendency to backfire on those who try it.)
</li><li> A meta version happened to the Tau special character Commander Shadowsun in the sixth edition rules. The character was well-liked by fans but the miniatures didn't sell well because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">she wasn't very effective on the tabletop outside of very specific circumstances</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulInTheirElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulInTheirElement">she did street fighting and she did it well</a>). Rather than just kill her off or forget her entirely when the model was discontinued, the writers had her promoted to head of the Tau military. However, with a new edition, a new Codex, and a new model, she began to see much more play as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance">her cost to field came down and she buffs any unit she joins</a>.
</li><li> The Imperium is nominally ruled by the council of High Lords of Terra, representatives of the most powerful organizations within the Imperium. However, the Inquisition and Adeptus Sororitas view such an appointment as a huge downgrade that cripples their primary duty for a position in ineffective bureaucratic council. In the Inquisition's case this is largely because their internal organization is largely nonexistent; their solution is to have their official representative be whoever was in the area and not doing anything important that day.
</li><li> The Imperial Guard itself can act like this for some of more zealous individuals. Unlike Space Marines, most Imperial Guard officers above captain level never take the field as they are too busy actually coordinating their troops. A particular example is Colonel Regina Casteen who would love to personally shoot at enemies of the Imperium on the front lines, but her position requires her to stay in the command center.
</li><li> New Space Wolf recruits who are particularly reckless and impulsive even by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Blood Claw</a> standards tend to get "promoted" to Skyclaws, where they are given jetpacks to get them to the enemy faster so they can get kil, err, fight earlier.
</li></ul></li><li> In roleplay groups in general, it's not uncommon to have the least competent/interesting/useful member of the party be promoted GM (or equivalent term). An incompetent DM just makes monsters somewhat easier to kill, an incompetent party member can be a lot more dangerous. Note that this only works for combat-focused groups; in roleplay-focused games it's an invitation to disaster.

At first, this may seem quite attractive ("I'm part of the legislative body.

So instead he sends Willy out on the road, where the man can live in his delusions of being the greatest salesman the world has ever seen (when the truth is the complete opposite).

The bastard denies accusations of his presence and the Council believes him due to lack of evidence. When Shepard gets said evidence and presents it, she/he is given Spectre status and Anderson is quietly promoted into a desk job to keep him away. There is some justification here: Anderson was in command of the <em>Normandy</em>, and it was determined that Shepard, as the new human Spectre, needed a ship. Anderson accepted a promotion to a desk job in lieu of retirement, so that Shepard would be able to take command of the ship. There is also a political dimension (Anderson was considered too emotionally invested in bringing down Saren, among other things), but he admits that, while he's saddened about losing his command so quickly, he knows that it's the best possible option to help Shepard since it insures that there will be someone working on Shepard's behalf instead of leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador">Ambassador Udina</a> as the sole voice of humanity on the Citadel.

<p></p><h3>Business</h3>
The business world is probably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a>, but there are many reasons for kicking someone upstairs:
<ul><li> Middle management exists mainly for this reason. Anyone who works at a company for a certain amount of time expects to be rewarded in some way, but many of these people haven't actually <em>done</em> anything to earn that reward. But the company still needs to keep them happy, so they "promote" them to a position that basically exists for this purpose. One old British management book explicitly recommends this as a way of keeping them out of positions of real power.
</li><li> In many places, it's difficult to actually fire someone for being incompetent — you can do it, but it requires a lot of paperwork and likely severance pay as well. Companies who don't want to deal with that will shuttle off incompetent workers to a position where they have no responsibility. To get fired, you would actually have to do something <em>wrong</em>, like downloading porn on a work computer or something.
</li><li> Tech industries sees this a lot, as products change so quickly that the innovator who kicked off the trend is not always the guy whom everyone wants to man the helms today. But since this innovator was once incredibly valuable to the company, it's hard to get rid of him:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveJobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveJobs">Steve Jobs</a> was technically <a class="urllink" href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=The_End_Of_An_Era.txt">given this treatment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shortly before he left Apple to form NeXT.

Sega, feeling more frustrated and pressured than ever, then restructured the entire R&amp;D department and explicitly ordered him to make a racing game (which to be fair, was what got him into the spotlight in the first place).

<ul><li> Within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">American Political System</a>:
<ul><li> The office of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicePresidentWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicePresidentWho">Vice President of the United States</a>, for the longest time, was viewed as being an utterly pointless position — Vice President John Nance Garner once famously called the office "not worth a bucket of warm piss". Vice Presidents were traditionally chosen as a way of covering the perceived weaknesses of the presidential candidate, thus bolstering the ticket and giving everyone someone they could agree with, but it was also convenient to "promote" someone to Vice President to keep them from causing problems in a position of actual power. The problems start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">when the president dies or resigns</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler">John Tyler</a> was chosen as the running mate of Whig Party candidate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison">William Henry Harrison</a> in 1840, despite having once been a Democrat and having left the party but retained its ideology. Harrison died thirty days after his inauguration in 1841. The Whig-controlled Congress was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">most dismayed</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MillardFillmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MillardFillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> became President in near-identical circumstances to Tyler; he was nominally a Whig but chosen to balance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZacharyTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZacharyTaylor">Zachary Taylor</a>. In this case, the Whigs in Congress <em>preferred</em> the more level-headed Fillmore to Taylor, whom it was feared could drive states into secession with his aggressive anti-slavery policies. History wound up siding with Taylor on this one, though, with Fillmore's approach (culminating in the Compromise of 1850) seen as well-meaning but misguided.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJohnson">Andrew Johnson</a> was a leader among pro-Union Southern politicians during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">Civil War</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> picked him as his running mate in 1864 to reward his loyalty. In 1865, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunmanWithThreeNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunmanWithThreeNames">John Wilkes Booth</a> killed Lincoln in the last days of the war, leaving Johnson responsible for the impending Reconstruction. Johnson was seen as too lenient to the former secessionists, who were still fighting tooth and nail against the empowerment of the newly freed black slaves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was chosen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley">William McKinley</a>'s running mate in 1900 mostly to get rid of him. His incessant Progressive grandstanding as Governor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkState">New York</a> was incredibly embarrassing to the plutocrats who ran the Republican Party, and they hoped that he could be stripped of power as Vice President. Republican National Committee Chairman Mark Hanna was against the nomination, though, warning that there would be "only one life between that madman and the presidency", and when McKinley was assassinated, Hanna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWarnedYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWarnedYou">proved prescient</a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Hanna:</strong> Now look! That damned cowboy is President of the United States!
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman">Harry Truman</a> is an odd case, and his Presidency in fact led to the amendment of the Constitution to codify the presidential succession — and also to popular awareness of the dangers of kicking someone "upstairs" to be Vice President. Truman was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s running mate in 1944, but he accepted the nomination reluctantly, and the Democratic National Convention was well aware of Roosevelt's failing health and <em>expecting</em> that he would be President. However, by early 1945, FDR decided he was feeling well enough to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> to its conclusion, and by the time he died later that year, nobody had gotten around to telling Truman about the American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear weapons program</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin">Sarah Palin</a> never got to be Vice President, and popular awareness of this trope was a big reason why. John McCain had nominated her as a way to broaden his base with more right-wing Republicans, but Palin's stunning lack of competence — with the extent of her foreign policy experience being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetically</a> expressed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> as "I can see Russia from my house!" — turned many people off from voting for McCain even though they preferred his policy, realizing that if anything happened to McCain (who was not in the best of health<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32byp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note32byp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32byp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For what it's worth, he survived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>'s two-term presidency, but given the stress of the office, it's not certain that the same would have happened had he actually been President</span>), she would be President. Political science is a bit of a mixed bag on if the VP truly affects the outcome of the election (either positively or negatively) but there is evidence to suggest that she did negatively affect the ticket given his age. A <a class="urllink" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379410000442">2010 paper out of Standford<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> estimates that she cost him about 2 million votes. Ironically enough, the only other recent VP pick who really affected the outcome was Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 (the first woman to run as VP and the third ever) who helped Mondale close the gap some since he picked a woman because the 1980 election was the first where women became a big part of the Democratic partys infrastructure.
</li><li> Mike Pence was picked as the VP in 2016 partially to assuage Evangelicals fears about Trump and partially because hed overseen a series of catastrophes as governor of Indiana (causing an HIV outbreak and a religious liberty bill that had a huge negative financial impact on the state) and the party was worried hed lose what should be a slam-dunk election.
</li></ul></li><li> But other positions relating to the Presidency, including the President himself, have been subject to this line of thought:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesBuchanan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesBuchanan">James Buchanan</a> is widely thought of as one of the worst Presidents in American history, and the first to be called a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakistocracy">kakistocrat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (and rightly so). He was only elected because he was an unknown who had no position on the then-hot debate over the Kansas-Nebraska Act (<em>i.e.</em> whether those new states would be allowed to have slaves), and he had no position on the issue because he was ambassador to Britain at the time, and he was only sent there because he was so incompetent that he had to be pushed out of the way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson">Andrew Jackson</a> made him a minister in Russia because "[i]t was as far as I could send him out of my sight, and where he could do the least harm. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">I would have sent him to the North Pole</a> if we had kept a minister there.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ktfa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ktfa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ktfa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At the time, no human being had ever been to the North Pole.</span>" Unfortunately, this provided Buchanan with perceived "experience" which led to his election. Historians believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">secession of the Southern states</a> might have been crushed in 1860 but for Buchanan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitherer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitherer">dithering</a> — by the time Lincoln was elected, it was too late.
</li><li> In 1996, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>'s staff was uncomfortable with all the time Clinton was spending with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton had already been dogged by a few sex scandals, and not wanting the appearance of another one, they shipped Lewinsky to a useless "assistant" position at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePentagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePentagon">The Pentagon</a>. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">backfired spectacularly</a>, as that's how everyone found out about Clinton's affair with her, and Clinton lying about it led directly to his impeachment.
</li><li> Some theorize that this is what was done to Jon Huntsman when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> selected him to be ambassador to China in 2009, fearing that he would be the strongest challenger to the Presidency in the 2012 election. Huntsman ended up running anyway and finished a distant fifth in the Republican primary. Incidentally, he also did a pretty decent job as Ambassador to China.
</li></ul></li><li> In July 2016, a Wikileaks disclosure of emails from the Democratic National Committee revealed that chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz was incredibly frustrated with the incompetence of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. This led to a perception that she was trying to actively undermine Sanders, and subsequently to her stepping down from the DNC to become "honorary co-chair" of Clinton's campaign.
</li></ul></li><li> Within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem">British Political System</a>:
<ul><li> The position of Lord President (or, in full, Lord President of the Privy Council) is often seen as such a position. Its powers are entirely dependent on what the Prime Minister feels like, and these days, the position is often filled by a senior party member whom the PM wants to keep but doesn't trust with real power for whatever reason, either because he can't handle it or because no one else likes him.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5edrb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5edrb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5edrb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ironically, the position was originally hugely important — even more so than the Prime Minister. The role was created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a> for his friend Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, the idea being that if the King was too unwell to govern (or couldn't be bothered), Brandon would have virtually the same power and authority as the King. Meanwhile, the position of PM didn't formally exist until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryCampbellBannerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryCampbellBannerman">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a>—though it had been a <em>de facto</em> office since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertWalpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertWalpole">Robert Walpole</a>—and most of the position's modern-day importance only comes from its merger with the office of First Lord of the Treasury. British politics is <em>weird</em>.</span> A few notable examples:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NevilleChamberlain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NevilleChamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> was handed the position by his successor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> upon the start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. The nomination is often seen this way, given that Chamberlain was mostly famous for attempting to appease Hitler, but Churchill did also establish the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Presidents_Committee">Lord President's Committee<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which was headed by the Lord President and basically ran the British economy for the duration of the war. Chamberlain, for his part, was ill with terminal cancer and lasted only six months; oddly, political wrangling meant that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ClementAttlee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ClementAttlee">Clement Attlee</a> held the position for most of the war.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NickClegg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NickClegg">Nick Clegg</a> served as Lord President from 2010 to 2015, at the same time he was Deputy Prime Minister and his party was instrumental to the coalition government of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavidCameron">David Cameron</a>, so he was pretty important and powerful. However, the position of "Deputy Prime Minister" technically doesn't exist (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom">it's complicated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), so (in a case of classically British constitutional engineering) he had to be kicked upstairs to give him a position commensurate with the power he <em>actually</em> had (and also to ensure a place in the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_precedence_in_England_and_Wales">order of precedence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). This turned into a problem when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">the coalition started to fall apart</a> (leading to suspicion that Cameron was just trying to avoid falling victim to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a>), and when it finally disbanded in 2015 and Clegg resigned from both offices, the position of Deputy Prime Minister was reduced to such a sinecure that it was eventually retired.
</li></ul></li><li> The "office of profit under the Crown" is a sinecure created for the purpose of allowing an MP to resign, because it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResignationsNotAccepted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResignationsNotAccepted">technically impossible</a> for an MP to do so. Such positions usually have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHamTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHamTitle">Large Ham Title</a> along the lines of "Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham" and have no real responsibilities. But they do come with a nominal income, because the whole point of getting an "office of profit under the Crown" is that this creates a conflict of interest that automatically disqualifies the officeholder from being an MP. The position is held until some other MP wants to resign (which could be mere minutes later). This legal fiction is so entrenched that Gerry Adams, a Sinn Fein politician who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">didn't want to be an officer of the British Crown</a>, tried to resign without applying for such a job, only for one to be given to him anyway (along with an apology and a pittance check).
</li><li> The House of Lords has been seen for the last few decades as clearly subordinate to the House of Commons and no place for an aspiring politician. However, some such aspiring politicians were the children of members of the House of Lords, and since a seat in the Lords came with a hereditary peerage, when a member died, his seat would be inherited by his children along with his title — effectively barring said children from seeking a <em>real</em> political career in the Commons and kicking them upstairs regardless of their competence. The most famous such case was Tony Benn, whose father was a government minister who was created Viscount of Stansgate in recognition of his service during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>; when his father died, Benn was stripped of his position as an MP because he inherited his father's peerage. Benn's political advocacy led to the Peerage Act of 1963, allowing Benn and similarly situated people to disclaim their positions as lords and stand for the Commons instead (and the whole automatic process of inheritance was ended by the Lords Reform of 1999).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">King Edward VIII</a>, after his abdication, was styled Duke of Windsor but still mistrusted and suspected of being a Nazi sympathizer — in particular, he was accused of leaking Allied war plans and had German guards appointed to his home in France during the occupation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a>, seeking to get Edward out of Europe to a place where he couldn't help the Nazis, made him Governor of the Bahamas (which, considering that he was already a duke, could more accurately be considered "kicked sideways"). Churchill could only get Edward to go to the Bahamas under threat of court-martial, as the Duke was a gazetted major-general.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEuropeanUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEuropeanUnion">The European Union</a>'s myriad semi-governmental structures are seen throughout Europe as a way of doing this to old, annoying, or incompetent politicans, often with the added benefit of removing them from the country entirely. There's a German saying, <em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">Hast du einen Opa</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">schick ihn nach Europa!</a>"</em> ("Have a grandpa? Send him to Europe!"), and several media outlets have cited the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Borgen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Borgen">Borgen</a></em> example, and particularly that episode's title: "In Brussels, No One Can Hear You Scream".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> worked his way into power this way; Lenin didn't like him but couldn't get rid of him, so he made him General Secretary of the Communist Party and banished many of Stalin's supporters to diplomatic posts elsewhere. However, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">backfired</a> on Lenin in a big way; what the post lacked in nominal power, it made up for in <em>practical</em> power. Stalin quickly realized that he had the power to reward supporters by giving them key government positions, and he also maintained the Party's membership records — <em>i.e.</em> kept tabs on everyone. By the time everyone realized what was happening, Lenin had died and it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">too late to stop Stalin</a>. Thanks to Stalin, even after his death it was the General Secretary who was the <em>real</em> leader of the USSR, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">the Premier</a> (who may have been, but usually wasn't, the same person). Stalin would ironically end up doing this to people <em>he</em> wanted to get rid of (when he wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">liquidating them outright</a>) — NKVD chief Nikolai Yezhov, when seen as a threat to Stalin's power, was punted off to run river transportation, while his first deputy, Frinovsky, was put in charge of the Navy.
</li><li> Examples from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, once he became leader of the German Workers' Party, "promoted" the party's founder and longtime leader Anton Drexler to "Honorary President". It was obvious who held the real power.
</li><li> Backfired after the 1932 Presidential Election. He lost, but in order to pacify the growing Nazi party and to keep the Communist party down at the behest of industry leaders, President Hindenberg named Hitler Chancellor, while also naming a fellow moderate centrist Franz von Papen to be Vice-Chancellor, with the idea being that they would keep the real work themselves and keep Hitler in a mostly-powerless role. Unfortunately, the Reichstag fire broke out and, at Hitler's request, hundreds of thousands of Communists were rounded up and sent off to concentration camps, and then President Hindenberg passed away, allowing Hitler to introduce a bill to the German parliament to make him a dictator. Two months after being named chancellor, and with all of his political opponents in prison, the Enabling Act of 1933 was passed and Hitler had become a dictator.
</li><li> Hermann Göring was effectively kicked upstairs and sideways. For years, he had been Hitler's second-in-command, accumulating such titles as President of the Reichstag, Minister President of Prussia, Commander-in-Chief of the <em>Luftwaffe</em>, founder of the Gestapo, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryToFitThatOnABusinessCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryToFitThatOnABusinessCard">Minister for Economics, Aviation, and Forestries</a>. In 1940, after the fall of France, he was promoted to <em>Reichsmarschall</em>, firmly establishing him as the second-in-command. However, after failing to establish air supremacy over Britain, he started to fall out of favor with Hitler. After failing to resupply the Sixth Army at Stalingrad, Göring was effectively removed from command positions and spent the remainder of the war living like a Roman emperor in his many palaces.
</li></ul></li><li> In most republics that use the parliamentary system, the president is the head of state but has no real power (as with a ceremonial monarchy). It is therefore a useful place for kicking people upstairs:
<ul><li> Eamon de Valera, the principal author of the Irish Constitution, used to claim he had specifically designed the Presidency to be "a nice easy job for my old age". Sure enough, after serving as the President of the Executive Council and Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland for most of the years from 1932 to 1959, he became the President of Ireland at the age of 77.

It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">backfired</a> very, very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">badly</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco">Francisco Franco</a> promoted Juan Yagüe, one of his best army commanders, to the position of Air Force Minister so he wouldn't threaten him in the future.
</li><li> Former mayor of La Coruna Francisco Vazquez (Spain) a well-known Catholic before he became a socialist, was promoted to Ambassador to the Holy See so he would embarrass the socialist prime minister with his ideas about abortion being a crime.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a> was a nepotist bureaucratic nightmare, which inspired the Latin maxim for this sort of manoeuvre, <em>Promoveatur et amoveatur</em> — "Let him be promoted to get him out of the way." It apparently happened quite often.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ModernEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ModernEgypt">post-1952 Egypt</a>, the position of Vice President was used to reward military officers who were loyal to the regime but seen as harmless schmucks not really in contention for power. This backfired twice: once when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GamalAbdelNasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>'s VP Anwar Sadat proved to be a devious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> who quickly eliminated his competition after Nasser's death, and then when Sadat's VP Hosni Mubarak turned out to be a boring, heavy-handed, and not particularly intelligent leader. President Muhammad Morsi did this to the military more directly in 2012 by stripping several top generals of their power but also giving them a bunch of medals and big fat pensions — they promptly folded under pressure, but after large anti-Morsi protests in 2013, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoup">their replacements didn't</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Myanmar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, Aung San Suu Kyi was prevented by law from ever becoming President and instead made the "State Counselor", a position that is theoretically akin to Prime Minister and makes her <em>de facto</em> head of the government, but which has no real power.
</li><li> This was a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a>'s methods for gaining power. He'd invite nobles over to his home (obviously, can't turn down an invitation from the king) and then after they knew the lay of the land, he'd assign them a job working in the palace. Because they were now far away from home, they couldn't really run their lands, so Louis could do whatever he wanted there, while the nobles enjoyed their palatial lifestyle and cushy job.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Military</h3>
The military has a particularly easy way of doing this, as it can "promote" incompetent people away from the front lines and into a cushy desk job somewhere with only administrative responsibilities.
<ul><li> In naval jargon, this is known as "yellowing". The term derives from the practice of the Royal Navy, where until 1864, captains were promoted to flag rank by strict seniority. This meant that if they had a competent captain whom they wanted to promote to rear-admiral, they couldn't do it until they had promoted everyone else ahead of him on the list. They solved this problem by promoting those other captains but not giving them any command (known as leaving them "on the beach"). If you <em>did</em> have a command, it was organised (again by seniority) into "red", "white", and "blue" squadrons, so rear-admirals without a command were said to have a "yellow squadron" (like the yellow sand on the beach).
</li><li> Colonel Leonard Wood <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConversationalTroping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConversationalTroping">name-dropped the trope</a> in 1898, during preparations for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar">Spanish-American War</a>. Wood was the leader of the 1st Volunteer Cavalry regiment (<em>a.k.a.</em> the Rough Riders), only to realize that his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, was a lot more popular than he was. He wrote, "I realized that if this campaign lasted for any considerable length of time, I would be kicked upstairs to make room for Roosevelt." He turned out to be wrong — he was instead promoted to commander of the Fifth Army Corps' 2nd Brigade Cavalry Division, whose previous commander had fallen ill, and he got to lead the Brigade for the rest of the war, including during their famous victory at Kettle Hill and San Juan Heights.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, Allied commanders who lost battles were often promoted to a different front to get them out of the way:
<ul><li> Archibald Wavell had this happen <em>twice</em>, first in North Africa and then in Southeast Asia; he actually was competent, but Churchill disliked him and had a knack for putting him into hopeless situations. He ended his career as Viceroy of India just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePartitionOfIndia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePartitionOfIndia">it was about to split</a>.
</li><li> Gordon Bennett of the Australian 8th Division was given command of Australia proper in response to his escaping from Japanese-occupied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore">Singapore</a> and leaving the rest of his command to the tender mercies of the Japanese.
</li><li> Herbert Sobel, as immortalized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers">Band of Brothers</a></em>, exemplified the trope; he was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">absolutely ruthless training officer</a>, and everyone he commanded hated him but respected him and credited his tactics with making them better. But he was such a failure at actually <em>leading</em> the unit that shortly before the Normandy invasion, he was promoted to Captain and shunted off to train new recruits. He never got the chance to serve on the front lines and attain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious">glory on the battlefield</a> like he so desperately wanted — he ended the war as a supply office, and he was kept stateside during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">The Korean War</a> despite being recalled to active duty.
</li><li> Lloyd Fredendall was commander of the II Corps at the Battle of Kasserine Pass in 1943 but after the American defeat, he was reassigned to stateside training assignments.
</li></ul></li><li> William Westmoreland commanded American troops in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> between 1964 and 1968, earning widespread criticism for treating the war as a conventional conflict while downplaying its guerrilla aspect. After being relieved of his command, he became the U.S. Army Chief of Staff.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Media</h3>
Sometimes, you have to keep someone on board the production of a creative work, even if they've run out of ideas or are otherwise endangering the production.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> had this happen <em>twice</em> with series creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>. The first time, in response to the poor reception of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> (of which he was producer and co-writer), he was promoted to "Executive Consultant"; the studio wanted nothing to do with Roddenberry, but they couldn't fire him because his contract prevented it (and because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanboy">Fanboys</a> would scream bloody murder). Roddenberry was allowed to make as many notes and suggestions as he liked; his replacement Harve Bennett could ignore them as much as <em>he</em> liked. The exact same thing happened on the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">The Next Generation</a></em>, with Roddenberry being responsible for many of the shaky creative decisions of the first and second seasons; his level of influence over the show was tactfully but firmly reduced over time, and this was a big factor in the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Growing the Beard</a> during the third season.
</li><li> During the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APassageToIndia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APassageToIndia">A Passage to India</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean">David Lean</a> became so unhappy with cinematographer Ernest Day's work that he "promoted" Day to being the film's second unit director and sent him off to film shots of the Indian landscape (most of which didn't even make it into the finished film), while another cinematographer was called in to finish the film.
</li><li> Comics artist and writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvanDorkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EvanDorkin">Evan Dorkin</a> drew a strip about his experience in Hollywood: he kept getting attached to projects that never got off the drawing board, but this gave him such a big "track record" that he became "too expensive to hire" and had to return to comics work. (It's probably humorous exaggeration on his part.)
</li><li> Following the controversial decision by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> to remove Ann Curry as co-host of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Today" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Today">Today</a></em>, the network invoked the trope by naming her "National and International Correspondent" for NBC News, only for the Peacock to bar her from doing live appearances, meaning she could only appear in pre-recorded segments.
</li><li> This is reported to have happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation">Toei Animation</a> producer Hiroaki Shibata. Having produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure">seasons</a> of the company's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">very lucrative</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em> franchise, he was apparently moved to Toei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu">Tokusatsu</a> division during the airing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoPrincessPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoPrincessPrettyCure">Go! Princess Pretty Cure</a></em>. This was rumored to be because of poor reception of the seasons he did produce, in particular throwing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerves</a> at the audience when Toei was hoping to take it easy and pull the franchise out of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> — they couldn't fire him, but they weren't going to be patient with him.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> VP Bill Jemas was sent off to spearhead the failed revival of Marvel's Epic line after managing to alienate much of the company's creative staff with his erratic behavior and micromanaging tendencies.
</li><li> Scott Gimple took the reigns of showrunner of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> for its fourth season and enjoyed a period of acclaim and ever-soaring ratings, as many fans acclaimed his focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode">episodes that fleshed out the cast</a>, fast pacing, and crowd-pleasing action. However, as time went on, Gimples storytelling decisions came under fire, with much criticism going to several cliffhangers deemed ratings traps and frustrating shock plot twists. Gimple's talent at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode">Bottle Episode</a> also ironically came under fire since fans would have to wait weeks to see their favorite characters again, and they also noticed an increasing tendency <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">for plots to not progress at all until the season finales or premieres</a>. Gimple also oversaw the infamous cliffhanger of Season 6 which received a visceral reception from critics and fans, the resolution of which was the point of no return for the shows ratings that have declined ever since. Gimples slow pacing during Negan's reign as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> also drew vocal criticism for employing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy</a>, but the final blow to Gimples tenure was his decision in Season 8 to kill off a major character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAdaptation">who was still alive and well in the source material</a> and came as a nasty shock to the characters young actor. The criticism was so intense that AMC promoted Gimple to a new position overseeing the franchises content as a whole that removed his power to make final storytelling decisions in any of the franchise's television adaptations. This ended up being Subverted when in addition to his new role, Gimple ended up as the showrunner of spin-off series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearTheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearTheWalkingDead">Fear the Walking Dead</a></em>. Unfortunately, history repeated itself as that series began to suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> and received much of the same complaints that the mothership show received, so time will tell if Gimple will be kicked off another <em>Walking Dead</em> series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> is generally considered to have suffered continuous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> ever since Marc Guggenheim and Wendy Mericle took over as showrunners at the start of Season 3 (barring a brief return to form in Season 5). However, due to Guggenheim's friendship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregBerlanti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregBerlanti">Greg Berlanti</a>, the two managed to keep their jobs despite growing discontent from the fans and falling ratings. What finally got them kicked off the show was Season 6, which was regarded as the worst season of the show since Season 4 (a season so terrible that even lead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenAmell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenAmell">Stephen Amell</a> professed to hating it) and saw the ratings dip below one million for the first time since <em>Season 1</em>. While Mericle left the franchise entirely, Guggenheim was promoted to the role of "executive consultant", and they were replaced by the much more liked Beth Schwartz for the last two seasons.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Sports</h3>
This commonly happens in sports. Sometimes, a coach or manager is popular with the fans (often for being long-serving, and sometimes for being a successful player in his own right with the same team back in the day), so he can't be easily removed. Other times, management has found someone better but doesn't want to unceremoniously fire him. And still other times, his contract <em>prevents</em> him from being fired, but not from being given a different position; this is particularly common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Association Football</a>.
<ul><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball">basketball</a> player Isiah Thomas was so incompetent in charge of the New York Knicks — but so impervious to removal — that he had to be given a "managerial" job which explicitly prevented him from even contacting the players.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Ice Hockey</a>, the Chicago Blackhawks did this to general manager Dale Tallon during the 2009 offseason. After some poor salary cap management and a paperwork snafu, he was made "senior advisor" and replaced as general manager by Stan Bowman. That season, Tallon left to become general manager of the Florida Panthers. (The fact that Chicago won the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StanleyCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StanleyCup">Stanley Cup</a> in 2010 leads to debates as to which GM deserves credit for building that team).
</li><li> Gerard Houllier, manager of the French national <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football team</a>, had this happen to him in 1993 after a disastrous attempt at qualifying for the 1994 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">World Cup</a>. He was put in charge of "football development", supposedly out of sympathy, with the French Football Federation feeling that he was so catastrophically unpopular that no club would ever employ him again. Ironically, he did well in his new role and was widely credited for playing an important role in France winning the World Cup in 1998; he went on to be a successful manager again for Liverpool and Lyon.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL</a> provides an inter-coaching example; the Washington Redskins wanted to oust head coach Jim Zorn, but not wanting to fire him, they kept him as head coach but convinced former coach Sherm Lewis to come out of retirement (he was literally calling bingo for senior citizens) and gave him all play-calling duties. This didn't help; the Redskins were still not a good football team, and Zorn, Lewis, and the rest of the coaching staff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">were all eventually fired</a>. Oddly, the term "Zorning" for this phenomenon is now used in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">Washington, D.C.</a> intelligence community.
</li><li> Also in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL</a>, Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman had this happen to him in early 2015; he was given the title "Executive Vice President of Football Operations", because head coach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">Chip Kelly</a> demanded the power to assemble his own roster and convinced team owner Jeffrey Lurie to oblige him. The team failed to perform anywhere close to expectations that season, and the players grew increasingly frustrated with Kelly and his methods. In late December, Kelly was fired, and Roseman was given his old job back but kept his "football operations" title. Roseman, for his part, views his year without power as a blessing in disguise, as he used what he learned to help the Eagles to greater success in subsequent seasons, culminating in their first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> in 2018.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a>:
<ul><li> Ole Anderson promoted the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> winning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA World Heavyweight Title</a> as a way to get rid of him — he hoped that the travel demands of a world champion would keep Flair out of the Carolinas.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a> commentator Joey Styles was promoted to head of WWE.com com because CEO <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> felt that his commentary didn't match WWE's style of wrestling, but knew that he was way too popular with the fans to fire. For his part, Joey seems to be fine with the move, and even mentioned on his blog that he is far more comfortable with his new position and wishes that his commentary career died with the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a>.
</li><li> Jesse Sorenson from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> Wrestling was given a job as a production assistant after a major injury prevented him from wrestling. When he was ready to return to wrestling, he got himself fired.

<ul><li> After the fallout of the Catholic Church's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">sex abuse scandal</a>, Cardinal Bernard Law, the Archbishop of Boston, was "promoted" from his prior office to the Roman Curia in Vatican City, where he served on several committees and held a few offices with no real authority.
</li><li> In his book <em>From Those Wonderful Folks Who Brought You Pearl Harbor</em> Jerry Della Femina describes an ad agency that had "the Floor of Forgotten Men". It consisted of workers with long-term contracts whom the agency didn't want anymore. They were moved to their own floor and given a single secretary and no work to do.
