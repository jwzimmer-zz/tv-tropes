<ul><li> In one of Robert Asprin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Myth</a></em> books, Don Bruce, a Mob boss, comes to see Skeeve, who has been quietly sabotaging Mob operations, and says he knows Skeeve is the reason the Mob hasn't succeeded in moving into the dimension of Deva. He lists the evidence: Skeeve knows the territory, has connections on Deva, etc. His conclusion? They should have hired Skeeve to work for them in the first place. This echoes an earlier scene in which the Devan Merchants' Association hires Skeeve to defend them from the Mob, not knowing he was the one who originally brought the Mob to Deva. To cover up the truth, Skeeve agrees to work for both sides, so he has to maintain a balance between working for the Mob and limiting Mob activity on Deva. He then spends years being paid by both sides and doing <em>nothing</em>.

Naturally, they assumed that the Manties would avoid provoking the League, at least at that point, and tried a little gambit to ruin their reputation as a side, by putting their agent (posing as a Manticoran one) on the League's border, promising aid to various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> movements in that restive region. The initial plan is to crush these local uprisings by betraying them and not providing any aid, thus in one blow getting rid of troublemakers, one planet at a time. A secondary objective is that if word ever got out, and the Manticorans ever became aware of the scheme, they assume that the Manticorans would do the logical thing and avoid a direct confrontation with the League and thus fail to provide the promised aid, crippling their reputation among the smaller nations who would also hear about it or anyone who might be inclined to side with them.

Griffin's plans are all quite mad, however, and Kemp — having clocked that Griffin is neither on the side of the angels nor has all his marbles in the same bag — has actually summoned the police. This means that a substantial part of their conversation in the latter chapters of the book is essentially Griffin bragging about his experiments and grandiosely making plans for 'their' future efforts, while Kemp is basically nodding along and every so often looking at his watch to see how much longer he has to wait before the police show up.

<ul><li> Prince was so prolific during his lifetime (39 studio albums!) that he frequently invoked this, rarely second-guessing himself while recording. <em>Dirty Mind</em> is essentially thirty minutes of polished demos he recorded at his home studio, often finishing multiple songs a day.

<ul><li> Also a good tactic when the DM asks if you did something in preparation. "Did you do X before Y?" "...yeah, sure."
</li><li> Though this can backfire; it is especially entertaining when the players start to say "Sure, let's go with that", then get that deer-in-the-headlights look because they just realized the DM might actually be checking to see if they did something that would insta-kill them.

</li></ul></li><li> This is a tactic emergency personnel and police are increasingly being encouraged to use when dealing with people having delusions due to mental illness/other issues affecting their perception of reality to get them to cooperate if you have to bring them in for their own/other's safety. A classic one is if someone believes they are being hunted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilkmanConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilkmanConspiracy">Milkman Conspiracy</a> to offer to bring them to a "safe" place where they won't be harmed, usually the hospital, and to provide someone, usually a police officer, to "guard" them at the hospital itself, which establishes a sense of trust. There are however limits to this, such as not saying you see something someone is hallucinating, and your own safety should never be compromised in the process.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dw.com/en/bus-stops-at-old-peoples-homes-take-patients-for-a-ride/a-3394237">Some old peoples' homes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> have started putting up fake bus stops so dementia patients can satisfy their need to "get away" or "go home" (even if they haven't lived in or even visited the place they're talking about for twenty years). Due to the deterioration of the brain that comes with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, nurses and other hospital workers find it difficult to reason with them, so they just direct them towards one of these fake bus stops so they can wait for a bus that will never come. Some wait for hours, then give up, saying they must have missed the bus and will try again later, though others will forget why they came here in the first place and let the nurse lead them back to their room. Almost of all them, however, report feeling more satisfied and generally happier, simply because they were able to go out and do something proactive, even if that something will be completely forgotten the next day. The creator of this fake bus stop program says that <em>"The sense that they have the freedom to do what they feel they need to do is very soothing to patients."</em>.
<ul><li> There's a nursing home in the Netherlands set up like a <em>small village</em>, complete with stores, restaurants, a movie theater, and a hair salon, for this exact purpose. The entire point is to provide a homey atmosphere that allows the patients to live a normal life while still receiving the care they need.

The lad's version, Potoooooooo, was said to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">amuse his lordship</a> so he kept it." This horse went on to be a champion and is an ancestor of most modern Thoroughbreds (which is why The Other Wiki has an article about the animal).
</li><li> This, ultimately, was how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany">East Germany</a> ended up reacting to the government decree that the borders would be open.

At the press conference, an ill prepared functionary failed to stress these points and was asked by a western journalist if the Berlin Wall was to be opened immediately. The press secretary, not being fully briefed, invoked this trope as a response. Cue thousands of people showing up at the checkpoints demanding to be let through. Cue the end of East Germany a short time later.
