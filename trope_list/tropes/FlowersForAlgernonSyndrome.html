</li></ul><p>However, by the end of the episode, the character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo">back to normal</a>. Sometimes, it's because the character's "normality" is required to solve a problem. Sometimes, it's because the method used to acquire the new ability (or perhaps even the new ability itself) presents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">an actual danger to the character who has it</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerMeltdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerMeltdown">and possibly even others</a>).

</p><p>In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> short story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersForAlgernon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersForAlgernon">Flowers for Algernon</a></em> by Daniel Keyes (later expanded into a novel), it was a side effect of the imperfect procedure that granted the intelligence in the first place. In the story, the main character, cognitively disabled Charlie, undergoes a surgery that boosts his intelligence. To an astounding degree, as it turns out: his intellectual breadth and knowledge allow him to learn languages of all kinds, science of all branches, surpassing even those that performed the operation. Charlie, though, finds that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation">his intelligence isolates him</a> just as much as his dimness did before it.

Note that how bad the Aesop is depends on how willing the characters are to go back to their former selves and how much the return was based on their own actions. If the character's friends force them to give up their improvement against their will, or if the character seeks to lose it because of mistreatment from others, then it can leave a very bitter taste in viewers' mouths.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> storyline "Flowers For Rhino" (guess what it was named after): dimwitted Spidey villain Rhino has a midlife crisis and goes through a brain-boosting procedure to make him super-intelligent so he isn't treated like shit. The procedure works, but he finds that his intelligence just keeps growing (at one point he rewrites <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> due to finding the writing style "sloppy", and later manages to discover Spidey's secret identity through a mathematical equation on top of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">utterly humiliating the webslinger in a fight</a> and getting a restraining order against him through manipulating the legal system), until he grows too smart to properly form relationships with people, loses interest due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeasuringTheMarigolds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeasuringTheMarigolds">Measuring the Marigolds</a> (at one point, his love interest calls him a monster, and to his horror, all he can think of is the definition and etymology of the word), and growing boredom and nihilism, as there's no longer anything he can't figure out. The "Algernon" of the story, an ape that went through the same procedure, eventually commits suicide <em>out of boredom</em>. Before he meets the same fate, Rhino orders the surgeons to not only reverse the procedure but make him <em>stupider</em> than he was before "just to be on the safe side". The doctors comply, he goes back to his old life, and he couldn't be happier.
<ul><li> Bonus: Because of his invulnerability, they have to perform the surgery with an industrial-strength oil drill.
</li><li> Double Bonus: He refuses anesthesia for the operation.
</li></ul></li><li> The newspaper comic <em>Tank McNamara</em> did a riff on this trope. Tank gets zapped by one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Dr. Tzapp's</a> experimental machines, and it cures his fumblemouth. Before long, Tank starts fancying himself an incisive critic, and the show's ratings plummet because nobody wants to listen to that. Eventually one of the other characters re-zaps him and he turns into his lovable, fumblemouthed self again.
</li><li> Another newspaper comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/HeartOfTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/HeartOfTheCity">Heart of the City</a></em>, has done this a couple of times, usually with Dean. One arc had him becoming a popular jerk, and a more recent one has him becoming "mature." In most cases, Heart tries to snap him out of it.
</li><li> A storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMuppetShowComicBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMuppetShowComicBook">The Muppet Show Comic Book</a></em> featured Animal taking pills to become calmer. Unfortunately, his drumming ability suffered (because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDrummersAreAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDrummersAreAnimals">All Drummers Are Animals</a>), and the Electric Mayhem had to replace him until he stopped taking the tablets. This may be based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> story of jazz drummer "Witty Ticcy Ray" (see below).
</li><li> Very common story concept in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano">The Beano</a></em>, especially in the strip <em>The Bash St. Kids</em>. The anniversary comic for that strip basically had this trope happen to the entire class.
</li><li> An early storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> featured Tails eating a fruit that made him into a supergenius. It also made him a stuck up jerk, and he tried to take on Robotnik by himself with his super intelligence. Unfortunately, by the time he reached Robotnik, the fruit's effects wore off and Tails was back to his normal intelligence...meaning the others had to come save him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> The mutant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Prodigy</a> can copy the knowledge or skills of anyone nearby but a mental block keeps him from remembering any of the knowledge after they leave. When he asks Emma Frost to remove the mental block, his exponential intellect makes him an uber-successful world leader who solves a lot of the world's problems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">through immoral means</a> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">carving up his best friend to cure major diseases</a>. He believes himself a benevolent dictator and decides to nuke any country that doesn't go along with him, and his former comrades have to engage in a suicide strike on the White House to stop him. David then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">wakes up from Emma's telepathic hallucination</a> and realizes he needs to keep a lid until he can handle the knowledge on his own.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth">Sabretooth</a> once takes one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>'s claws to the brain, which results in him becoming peaceful and relaxed. It takes a while, but eventually his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> repairs the damage, and he becomes an even <em>worse</em> psychopath with an increased psychic resistance: Prior to said claw-to-the-temple, Sabretooth could be (at least temporarily) pacified with certain psychic abilities, especially those of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Psylocke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Psylocke">Psylocke</a>, which put him in a state he called "the glow". Very Zen Buddhist. Shortly after he heals from Wolverine's attack, he is playing merry hell with the insides of the X-Mansion (having been a prisoner at the time) and Psylocke uses her attack as a last resort... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">to no effect</a>. Sabretooth explains how that psychic trick doesn't work anymore with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a> that is spine-chilling even for HIM.
</li><li> Hank McCoy, a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastMarvelComics">Beast</a>, has suffered from this syndrome at least twice in various continuities. His original mutant power was superhuman strength and dexterity and unusually large hands and feet, and it was established early on that he also happened to have genius-level intellect, leading to a career in biochemistry - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a>. He has occasionally suffered from traumas, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessorGuineaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessorGuineaPig">performed medical experiments on himself</a>, that made him lose intelligence, turning him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a>. He often has time to see this coming and regret the loss (until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">something comes along and makes him better</a>). In one continuity, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a> was the status quo for him and he was temporarily enhanced, playing this trope completely straight.
</li></ul></li><li> One issue of Polish comic book series "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TytusRomekIATomek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TytusRomekIATomek">Tytus, Romek i A'Tomek</a>" dealt with the misguided education of Tytus (who happens to be a talking, civilized chimp). In order to make him less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> and more adjusted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Professor T. Alent</a> first mindwipes him back to kindergarten, then proceeds to educate Tytus using his crazy inventions, to the point of force-feeding the ape's brain with information. Over the next weeks Tytus gains professor-grade education, receives several academic awards and finally starts burning out. In the end, he breaks into T.

</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em> arc has a hyper-dimensional force separate the League and their secret identities into different beings, allowing the heroes to be full-time heroes and the civilian-modes to have normal lives. Two of them were not happy about this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan">Plastic Man</a>'s normal self Eel O'Brian, a one-time thug, found himself trying to resist the desire to start stealing and beating people up again, wanting Plastic Man back so he wouldn't be stuck being a thug who remembered being a hero for the rest of his life. When talking about this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a>'s civilian identity John Jones, he even mentioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersForAlgernon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersForAlgernon">Flowers for Algernon</a></em>. Bruce Wayne and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> didn't fare too well either: The anger that made Bruce into Batman stayed with Bruce, causing Batman to lose all motivation to be a crime fighter and Bruce to lose control and start getting violent because he no longer had an outlet for his anger.

In desperation, the Martian Manhunter began using his telepathy to "reorder" the thoughts in the Joker's mind and restore him to sanity. However, this may be the shortest example of this trope in history; the Joker was briefly horrified at everything he'd done over the course of his life, but his mind was too disordered for J'onn to maintain control. Fortunately, the Flash was able to run in and grab the weapon away from Joker in the interval.

Although Duncan was never actually stupid, he merely bullied because he grew up in an abusive household. Becoming a genius gave him some perspective, and even though he will return to normal intelligence, it's implied that Duncan will be much wiser as a result of seeing his potential.

If one lets go of the notion that ogres are stupid slobs who act like they were raised in someone else's stolen barn, one gains the capacity to see them behaving just like anyone else (which means that Xanthian prejudice is strong shit). One ogre gets the Flowers for Algernon treatment at least three times over the course of the book as the viewpoint character repeatedly forgets that ogres aren't as stupid as he's always been taught.

At the end of the episode instead of reverting to normal or subpar intelligence, the subject has instead continued to exponentially rise to the point where his thoughts are incomprehensible to ordinary humans and only a machine can begin to understand what he thinks.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHappyApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHappyApple">The Happy Apple</a></em>, Nancy accidentally becomes cultured after a accompanying the firm's cultural advisor to a number of high class such as the ballet and the opera.

However, the firm then discovers a cultured Nancy is no longer 'average' and cannot predict winning advertising campaigns.

<ul><li> Most examples involving House himself are implied to actually be subversions: Wilson and Cuddy are usually quick to point out that he is looking for an excuse to go back to the way he was because he is scared that this trope will happen.
</li><li> A variation comes up in one case, when, while experimenting with a new method of pain relief, he is treating a young boy and indulges the parents' request for a pointless test that will disprove something House is certain is irrelevant, which ends up doing more harm than anticipated. However, House ultimately the right diagnosis at the start; the case's unfolding was not a failure of his intellect, but a product of him being more agreeable now that he's not in pain, but he knows that without that change, he would have refused the test just on principle. Rather than try to find a new balance, he decides to quit the treatment.

When he has to stop the drugs for medical reasons, we see him becoming sharper, more anxious, and utterly incapable of connecting with his girlfriend.
</li><li> In at least one case of the many House examples, House takes a procedure suggested to him by his team and does make him considerably nicer but a much worse doctor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and is quickly revealed to be nothing but House fucking with his team</span>.

The end of the episode reveals that the pills were actually placebos and Charlie didn't get any smarter, he just became EXTREMELY arrogant and the side effects were all in his head.

He quickly became the best Autobot you could have ever wanted, but was forced to build a new team of combining robots and transfer his intelligence into them to solve a dilemma.
</li><li> Averted by the biography on some of his more recent toys like the <em>Transformers Universe</em> Grimlock which actually gave him an intelligence score of <em>eight</em> (out of ten) and claims <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">"Me Grimlock"</a> is just a speech impediment. ALSO averted by his original toy's tech specs, which gave him an intelligence of 7 out of 10. The common excuse for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">"Me Grimlock"</a> is a speech impediment, as above, usually explained away as damage from the Gladiator Pits on Cybertron prior to the Great War (only in the cartoon was he built on Earth), one he chooses NOT to get repaired so people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">will underestimate him.</a>
</li><li> Others sources that it's a deliberate ploy Grimlock uses to fool his enemies. At least one shows that while of exceptional intelligence (i.e., piecing together information and drawing conclusions), he's <em>slow</em> at it due to having a primitive design. It's usually more beneficial to just start smashing stuff than to wait for the next synapse to fire.
</li><li> In the episode "Changing Gears", Megatron steals a circuit card from the Autobot Gears in order to power his solar needle. The effect of removing the circuit card makes Gears all happy and good natured instead of grumpy.

</li><li> Once Patrick got a sense of smell (via nose), but immediately regretted it after he realizes that he'll have to deal with nasty odors as well as pleasant ones. Subverted that he doesn't actually try to get rid of the nose, but try to make everything smell better, much to the annoyance of his friends. By the end of the episode, SpongeBob, Squidward, Sandy, and Mr. Krabs work together to make a stink ball so smelly it would destroy Patrick's nose, and it worked.
</li><li> In "Not Normal", SpongeBob gets upset by Squidward calling him not normal, so with the help of an instructional video, he changes his ways, and he's no longer a zany cartoon character. However, he winds up creating ink and paper Krabby Patties, causing Mr. Krabs to suspend him from work for the time being. SpongeBob then finds out he is incompatible with Patrick's ideas for fun. Squidward's reception for SpongeBob's change in character was positive at first, but gets annoyed at the latter's criticisms regarding his lifestyle and appearance. SpongeBob ultimately decides being normal is no fun for him, and tries to revert to his original personality with Patrick's help. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of the episode, it seems as though his new personality is permanent, but a normal version of Squidward appears and scares SpongeBob back to his original zany self.</span>

Eventually just as SpongeBob comes to accept Squidward, both of them are hit with another electric shock, making the two as grumpy and unsociable as Squidward was before.
</li><li> In "Rule of Dumb" Patrick discovers he is the legal heir to the throne of Bikini Bottom (Despite Bikini Bottom was never shown as a Hierarchy before then) He not only becomes more articulate with speaking (His vocabulary increased significantly for some reason) but he becomes a control freak, forcing SpongeBob to cater to his every whim, forcing Mr. Krabs to give him free Krabby Patties, takes a nerd's long sought comic book as well as takes an elderly fish's walker, also for no reason except that he believes he has a right to own everything. He later realizes what a monster he has become after all his friends desert him.

However the new show doesn't work out; cooking is now boring and the show's audience started crying.

Inspired by his motivational phrases, Fluttershy starts handing out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> to everyone who wrongs her, then progresses to lashing out at completely imaginary slights. (The unfortunate implications of the standard Flowers For Algernon plot are briefly touched on: when her friends confront her and say they don't like New Fluttershy very much, she accuses them of wanting a weakling they can push around. Her friends reply that they don't want Old Fluttershy back; they want <em>Nice Fluttershy</em> back.) Eventually she has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment and reverts to an even more extreme version of her prior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> self. Finally, she's confronted by a problem that can't be solved by hiding in her house, and she realizes that moderation is what's needed. She saves the day by being assertive <em>without</em> being a bully. This bit of character development sticks, and it becomes important in a few later episodes.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>, Zim reprograms GIR into duty-mode, in order to be more obedient. However, after hijacking a police car, Zim orders him to stay at the base out of fear of being exposed. Shortly afterwards GIR goes on a rampage, stealing information from the library, attacking people, and trying to kill Zim. It's only with the help of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">police officer with a squid's brain shooting ink at GIR</a> that Zim is able to stop him and restore his original personality.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/The7D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/The7D">The 7D</a></em> episode, Grim tricks Doc into giving him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalAccessory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalAccessory">Smarty-Pants Stone</a>, which makes him smart enough to come up a successful plan to take over Jollywood. However, he also rebuffs Hildy's affections, and even claims the kingdom for himself, so when Hildy sees Bashful sneaking up to steal back the stone, she doesn't warn Grim, and he goes back to his ditzy, but loving, self.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> episode "The Real You", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Finn</a> becomes smarter by way of magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses">Nerd Glasses</a> in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">impress Princess Bubblegum</a>. Everyone's okay with it, until his advanced train of thought leads him to proclaim "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">We were all born to die!</a>" and create a black hole. Bubblegum takes off the glasses to bring back "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">the real you</a>", and the dumber Finn stops the hole and saves he day. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Of course, the smarter Finn wasn't actually trying to hurt anyone, but to set up a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> on Bubblegum and <em>himself</em> in order to get a kiss from the princess. It works!</span>
</li><li> In Episode 70 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>, a spirit grants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Stumpy</a>'s wish to become intelligent. Nobody else is satisfied with it, since he makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">brutally honest</a> statements (such as saying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">Mr. Cat</a>'s drinking problem will lead to him becoming obese), annoys everybody by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">acting superior to them</a>, and winds up creating a bomb in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, at which point the spirit decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">return him back to his (relatively) normal, stupid self.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em> has "Operation: C.A.R.A.M.E.L.", an episode centered on what basically amounted to Flowers for Algernon <em>candy</em>; a legendary golden caramel that has to be invoked via a magic ritual that creates five pieces of delicious candy in exchange of stripping someone of his/her most valued trait. During the episode Heinrich Von Marzipan uses this against Sector V: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> Numbuh 1, becomes an indecisive dork, team inventor Numbuh 2 becomes a drooling idiot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> Numbuh 3 becomes a goth who cares about nothing, fight-loving Numbuh 4 becomes a sniveling coward and cool Numbuh 5 becomes an utter geek. At the end, we find out Heinrich was also a victim of the candies five years ago and Numbuh 5 tells him that the only way to reverse the curse is to share the candy. Heinrich obliges and we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> HER most valued trait was her beauty and then she returns to being a pretty girl named Henrietta</span>.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>, Waddles the Pig eats a mind-enhancing mushroom that Dipper had found in the woods. By the next morning he becomes intelligent enough to construct a text-to-speech generator for his own use (voiced by a deadpan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeilDeGrasseTyson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeilDeGrasseTyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>) and intends to build a machine that will enhance his intelligence even further, allowing him to solve all the world's problems. He is about to go through with it when Mabel expresses fears that he won't have time for her. Waddles has an epiphany about friendship being more important and switches the machine to 'reverse'. It seems like it falls into one of the classic pitfalls of this type of storyline, but there is some fridge logic to take into account that makes the story fit much better with the characters: Firstly, the story is non-canon, told by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Grunkle Stan</a> as a sales pitch, and also almost perfectly parallels <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the story of how Stan was estranged from his family, albeit with a more optimistic ending for Mabel/Stan.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces2017">Wacky Races (2017)</a></em> episode "Brains Before Brawn", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Tinys father</a> fixes the broken half of Tinys brain. With the other half restored, Tiny becomes far more intelligent, but also turns into such a jerk that he quits racing and becomes a rich life coach instead.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks (<em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</em>) has one chapter on "Witty Ticcy Ray", a man with severe Tourette's Syndrome who takes Haldol during the week to control his tics, but forgoes his medication on weekends where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">his condition actually enhances his wild jazz drumming</a>.
<ul><li> Also, his patients suffering from Sleeping Sickness for decades recovered after he gave them L-Dopa. He writes about them in his book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Awakenings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Awakenings">Awakenings</a></em> (later a movie starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a>). Unfortunately, as the patients developed resistance to the drug, its effects wore off and they all went back to sleep.
</li><li> Happened to yet another patient of his with a different disease: syphilis. Some forms of syphilis can cause mental problems, such as dementia and seizures. But this patient (who had acquired syphilis many years before, and showed these effects in old age) actually liked the effects so far: she was adapting to the disease fine, it was just making her slightly manic. The challenge was to find a treatment that would prevent the disease from getting any worse, but not reverse the effects so far. The trick to it is that the neurological damage caused by syphilis is irreversible. The standard penicillin regimen used to treat the disease anyway should have accomplished exactly what they wanted. Dr. Sacks did indeed give her penicillin when she requested treatment, and she stayed "frisky" (her word) without fear of getting worse. And then the story was reused for a clinic patient in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> People whose severe ADHD responds very well to medication can get something like this effect. While it doesn't change their personalities, it can make them so much less impulsive, and make it so much easier to concentrate, that they seem like completely different people while taking medication. But it's not all positive—ADHD on medication may let you concentrate when you like, but many say they lose some of their creativity, as well as losing the ability to "hyperfocus" (to concentrate exclusively on one thing, forgetting the rest of the world even exists) in exchange for a more typical type of concentration.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05jwz');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note05jwz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05jwz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is not universal, however; some creatives have noted that medication can actually improve their creative abilities as well as giving them better follow-through, and still others have noted that their creative abilities increase on small doses, but then drop off when the dose is increased.</span> Not to mention withdrawal symptoms which can range from fatigue to thoughts of suicide.
</li><li> Bipolar disorder, too. Nobody's disputing that going manic and hallucinating that you're the Virgin Mary is a bad thing, but there's also no denying that being manic feels good and makes you very creative, outgoing, and generally more fun to be around (at least before you get paranoid or get the delusion you're invulnerable and kill yourself by accident...). People with bipolar disorder often miss their manias while they're on medication, and stopping medication can get really tempting.
<ul><li> A lot of people have discovered that, despite the lack of enhanced creativity, they are far more productive while stabilized by medication. Why? Turtle beats the hare; being able to steadily work on things all the time gets more done than occasional hyperactive spurts (which get gradually more incoherent) followed by long periods of depression. Which makes the disorder an example of the trope done well.
</li></ul></li><li> People who suffer from depression often feel that the emotions they experience during a "down" period, while terrible, are at least authentic and so preferable to the artificial sense of complacency they get while on medication. Some refuse to take medication for this reason.
<ul><li> Reports of this happening with Prozac are quite common; in fact one scientist wrote a book about the subject called <em>Listening to Prozac</em>.
