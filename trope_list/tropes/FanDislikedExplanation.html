Sometimes though, for whatever reason, they don't like the answer. The fans then decide it would have been better to just leave the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotThreads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotThreads">Plot Threads</a> hanging, which would have given them mulch for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a>.

Failure to do so leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect">The Chris Carter Effect</a>, which can turn off fans in frustration. Likewise, not answering <em>enough</em> questions in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a> alienates fans. The hard place to the above rock is that when a series answers a question and the answer isn't quite as epic, clever, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">mind-shattering</a> as imagined. Maybe fan expectations are just too high. Maybe the answer is honestly unsatisfying. Maybe the answer conflicts with the genre established earlier in the work, like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">sci-fi explanation in a fantasy book</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheScientist">vice-versa</a>. Maybe it reveals that a character that did something seemingly of their own free will was instead subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> or brainwashing. Maybe it's a question no one asked or wanted to be answered at all, meaning <em>no</em> answer would be satisfying.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Regardless, the fans hear your explanation, and they don't like it. It's a Fan-Disliked Explanation.
</p><p>It should be noted that one factor in whether fans expect a mystery to be resolved or not is how prominent and important it was made originally. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> made such a huge deal about the mystery of "the numbers" that expectations for the solution were raised to an incredible pitch. In the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>'s backstory, though, it is made abundantly clear that it's irrelevant and that no clarification is to be expected.
</p><p>When the authors deliberately choose not to solve the mystery, possibly to avoid this trope, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">Riddle for the Ages</a>. If fans outright <em>reject</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> explanation as non-canonical, that can be an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">Death of the Author</a>.
</p><p>It's just like how everybody wants their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">Ship</a> to go through, but when it does, the result is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingBedDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingBedDeath">Shipping Bed Death</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Whether a show is better served by answering all, some, or none of the questions it raises varies by viewer. It's worth noting that this trope doesn't just focus on answers that are unsatisfying, but situations where an unanswered question actually <em>helped</em> the narrative. As you can expect, this is therefore YMMV.
</p><p>This sometimes overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a> - when fans prefer all the various explanations <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantingIsBetterThanHaving">rather than the actual answer</a>.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonFodder">Canon Fodder</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">The Unreveal</a>. If the explanation is disliked because it just raises further questions, then it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">Voodoo Shark</a>. This can occur when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterConflictsWithCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterConflictsWithCanon">Writer Conflicts With Canon</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em>: For a lot of fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Junko Enoshima's primary weapon was Mitarai's brainwashing animation techniques</span>, instead of their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a> qualities resulted in a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> for the franchise's villain, whose charisma and capacity to bind people to their will was always believed to be their most impressive quality. It was also unpopular among those who wanted to see why the lovable <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair">Danganronpa 2</a></em> cast would <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fall into despair</span>, finding the above explanation to be a lazy cop-out that forgoes characterization in favor of a one-size-fits-all plot point that is far less interesting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em>: The explanation of the true nature of Shonen Bat and Maromi, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as tidily explained as manifestations of guilt may be considered anti-climatic</span>. However, the show avoids this trope mostly by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leaving many aspects vague or outright unexplained or inconclusive.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaloLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaloLegends">Halo Legends</a></em> shorts quickly created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> regard to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> canon, with later explanations only providing partial comfort. One such lose-lose situation was at the end of the <em>The Package</em>, where John fights an Elite Major in a sword fight referred to in the subtitles as "Thel". However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheColeProtocol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheColeProtocol">Halo: The Cole Protocol</a></em> indicated that Thel 'Vadamee, the Arbiter from the original trilogy, had not fought a Spartan until he had already been promoted to Zealot. Some fans, however, still liked the irony of 'Vadamee nearly killing John only to be his ally later in the series. But that was nullified with the updated release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFallOfReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFallOfReach">Halo: The Fall of Reach</a></em>, which clarified that it was a different Elite fighting John named Thel <em>'Lodamee</em>. Now the canon was fixed again, but the irony was lost because John lost to a random mook.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR">MÄR</a></em> has this in regards to how certain plotlines were concluded in the manga, particularly the reason for Snow's existence. The anime took a different approach and offered an entirely new explanation to fit within their revised ending. This change, as well as the anime's ending in general is typically preferred by the fans, who considered the manga's ending rushed, anti-climactic and unsatisfying.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> had a <em>major</em> uproar from the fanbase when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> revealed that Grell is in fact a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">trans woman</a> instead of always being a guy, angering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi">Yaoi</a> fans that like to ship her with Sebastian.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fans were not happy with the explanation given for why the old Digimon could no longer reach Ultimate for multiple reasons, mainly because it felt like an excuse to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">brush the older children to the side</a>.
</li><li> In the first episode of the show, Tailmon (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Gatomon if you prefer</a>) loses her Holy Ring. Despite being set up as a major story arc, it's almost completely forgotten about, until Gennai reveals in the finale that he had it all along, but choose not to return it for several reasons. Fans generally regard this as a lazy explanation.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, the Dark Seeds part of Ken's backstory. A number of fans feel that his story would have been better had Ken simply snapped under a combination of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> in his family, the trauma over his older brother's death and the overall stressful life he was living, rather than having his innocence sucked out of him by an evil plant.
</li><li> In the 48th episode, it's revealed that the main antagonist of the series is in fact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Myotismon (or Vamdemon), one of the antagonists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">the previous series</a>, having possessed Oikawa and manipulated events from behind the scenes.</span> Several fans didn't like this twist, as there was little foreshadowing beforehand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Myotismon had already come back to life, making the idea of him coming back a second time seem uncreative.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> revealed the futures of the main cast. Fans hated almost all of them, feeling as though they came out of nowhere and/or flew in the face of character arcs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OusamaGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OusamaGame">Ousama Game</a></em> builds up the mystery about who exactly the "King" is and why they're forcing the students to act out the game. The eventual reveal that the King is actually a virus originating from a species of insect (that somehow acts as both a biological and computer virus) that kills through hypnotic suggestion is usually considered unsatisfying, if not completely nonsensical.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">Naruto/Sakura</a> fans dislike how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Kishimoto</a> has <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151015033145/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2015-10-14/masashi-kishimoto-at-new-york-comic-con/.94186">repeatedly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170131084216/https://www.saiyanisland.com/2017/01/naruto-creator-masashi-kishimoto-2017-interview/">stated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> was in fact just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>, that he <em>never</em> thought about making Naruto/Sakura canon, and that he had always planned for Naruto/Hinata being the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> since the early stages of the manga.

Toriyama liked it so much (despite admitting he'd never write a story so dark) he gave it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">his own manga</a>, effectively making the special canon to it. 23 years later however, the bonus <em>Dragon Ball Minus</em> chapter in 2013's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman">Jaco the Galactic Patrolman</a></em> showed Toriyama's version, depicting Bardock as a kinder person who sent his son away personally out of concern with Frieza's actions. In addition to Bardock's personality change, this made Goku a borderline Superman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">dividing the fanbase.</a> This got further reinforced when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></em> adapted these events into the modern animated storyline.
</li><li> The story that explains where Frieza's fear of the Super Saiyan Legend comes from is more universally derided, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> story. 2012's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallEpisodeOfBardock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallEpisodeOfBardock">Dragon Ball  Episode of Bardock</a></em> depicts him being sent back in time by Frieza's attack, where he gains the Super Saiyan form in front of Chilled, an ancestor of Frieza's. The issues come from the fact that the Super Saiyan form usually comes from intense anger over something personal: here, Bardock reaches it over Chilled hurting a member of a cartoonish alien race he barely knows. This, coupled with the special being a scant 20 minutes long, leaving no room for this event to be set up properly. <em>Episode of Bardock</em> is easier to ignore, however, as it is later contradicted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, and had been explicitly stated to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> story by its own author anyway.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> Killua was originally depicted as having a deep-seated fear of fighting stronger opponents, something that his father and abusive brother impressed upon him during his assassin's training. Other characters noted that this was a severe liability that hampered his reliability as a hunter and Killua himself worried that his cowardice would lead him to abandon his friends in the heat of the moment. Most fans were underwhelmed when it was revealed that this phobia wasn't a character trait, but instead due to needle that his brother placed in his skull and that it was resolved simply by removing the needle.

There is an answer that's explained to the characters, but it's the "vaguely unsatisfying" one of the page quote (unsatisfying to both the readers and the characters) and the writers give it no more weight than any of the other explanations. Of the three reasons set up in the first issue (Yorick's ring, Dr. Mann's baby and 355 with the Amulet of Helene), none of them really lasts the course. Says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">series writer Brian K. Vaughan</a> on the subject:
<div class="indent"><em>I feel that there is a definitive explanation, but I like that people don't necessarily know what it is. In interviews we always said that we would tell people exactly what caused the plague. The thing was, we never said when we were going to tell. We weren't going to tell you when we were telling you, I should say. We might have told you in issue #3. There might have been something in the background that only a couple people caught. It might have been Dr. Mann's father's very detailed, scientific explanation. It might have been Alter's off-the-wall conspiracy theory. The real answer is somewhere in those 60 issues, but I prefer to let the reader decide which one they like rather than pushing it on them.</em>

The original storyline for Booster and Skeets involved them fixing the timeline of the universe, which had become broken in the recent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>. To set up this story Skeets had frequent memory errors, where events as they occurred were different (sometimes drastically so) than as they had been recorded in the future. However, after these issues had been written, the writers decided that this plot was too generic, and had been done too often before by other time-traveling heroes, so they decided to go in a different direction and have an actual malevolent entity responsible for everything, including Skeets' out-of-character actions. Eventually, the series revealed that Skeets had been infested and was being controlled by a matured Mr. Mind, who planned to eat reality. However, though this covered why Skeets himself was evil and why several of Booster later actions were disasters, it never addressed why Skeets' earlier memory errors occurred in the first place since they were before Mr. Mind escaped from his cocoon.

Then she found out that she was pregnant with Bruce's child.

</li><li> <em>Issue #5</em> explained that the holes in the changeling's legs are leftover battle wounds from battling Princess Celestia a thousand years ago. While fans were fine with the idea of Chrysalis herself being that old, most found it odd and off-putting that the entire changeling species was just that one swarm that never aged, healed, or increased in number. Again, this along with their entire origin was given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscontinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscontinuityNod">Discontinuity Nod</a> in the main canon that instead shows that changelings are born with these holes, that they live and age normally, and that the holes and generally emaciated appearance is the result of them constantly being hungry instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of backstories, fans were <em>not</em> happy with the way the main series' Cosmos arc effectively whitewashed Discord's past villainy by portraying his past self as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Token Good Sidekick</a> and lovesick character in an abusive relationship — and as a generally well-intentioned character from the beginning and not responsible for any of the actual evil from his first reign — rather than the genuinely villainous and chaotic character the show portrayed him as. The consensus is that this revelation throws Discord's entire characterization from the tv series completely out the window for the sake of establishing Cosmos as a more serious threat, that it profoundly damages the impact of his journey towards good by removing a need for it, that it ruins the significance of Fluttershy being his first friend by establishing that he did in fact have friends in the past, that it robs the character of much of the agency that made him such a memorable villain in the first place, and that it cheapens the series' core theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> by revealing he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">Good All Along</a> rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">truly malicious creature who was changed for the better by friendship</a>. Even fans who like the comic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">tend to be fairly adamant</a> that the backstory was false and that Discord was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">lying about what really happened</a>.

Not only was there very little buildup or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> for that reveal, several readers were uncomfortable with the idea that the devoutly religious Kurt Wagner was secretly half-demon all along, and many saw it as a shoddy attempt at incorporating Christian mythology into the <em>X-Men</em> mythos (particularly since the same era featured the revelation that Archangel was descended from <em>actual</em> angels). It didn't help that many saw it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>, since Kurt was initially introduced being chased by racist, superstitious villagers who thought he was a demon when he was really just a guy with a skin condition—the Azazel story means the villagers were actually right the whole time. As an alternative, many fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">prefer to accept</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">original plan</a> for his backstory: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mystique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mystique">Mystique</a> and Destiny are his parents, and Mystique used her shapeshifting powers to temporarily become male so that she and her lover could conceive a child.

</li><li> The initial explanation for female Transformers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMegaseries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMegaseries">The Transformers Megaseries</a></em>—there aren't any naturally, the sole one we know of is the result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>'s experiment that drove her crazy—was almost universally seen as the low point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SimonFurman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SimonFurman">Simon Furman</a>'s time on the book. Aside from making it seemingly impossible for others besides Arcee to exist, it seemingly personified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial">Men Are Generic, Women Are Special</a> (other Transformers are treated as male, and nobody asked for an origin for that), the implication that being turned into a woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil">turned someone crazy and murderous</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> on its face, and even if you agreed with Furman that female Transformers were silly or needed explaining, you would probably have preferred one that didn't raise so many weird questions. Later writers went with the more accepted answer that "having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">No Biological Sex</a> doesn't mean you also have no gender; some Transformers just look like that and use female pronouns", and Arcee was given a retcon to make things a bit more palatable (she actually took part in the experiment willingly; it's just that he tortured her after he was done because he was a jackass).

<ul><li> Part of the point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield">Cloverfield</a></em> is that it doesn't explain anything about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExNihilo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExNihilo">the monster's origins</a>. The associated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame">Alternate Reality Game</a> and manga do, slightly, but not necessarily for the better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> A lot of fans felt that the inclusion of midichlorians as a "cause" of the Force was an unsatisfying answer to a question no-one asked.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>'s explanation that the "Balance of the Force" was not in fact the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Good and Evil</a> but rather the <em>destruction</em> of evil also got a frosty reception in some circles (namely, people who didn't understand that The Force is basically Taoism, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace">IN SPACE!</a>!). This is mainly because the Dark Side had been firmly established as a cosmic force in its own right and so seductive that Force users have to actively resist falling on a constant basis. How killing off one particular group of Dark Side users out of many constitutes "destroying evil" is never explained.
</li><li> The prequel trilogy tells the story of the Clone Wars, the destruction of the Jedi, the creation of the Empire, and the rise of both Darth Vader and Palpatine, all of which had been alluded to but never fully explained. Dissatisfaction with how some or all of those stories turned out accounts for a good portion of the prequel hate.
</li><li> Palpatine's first name, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">Sheev</a>, was lambasted as sounding stupid immediately upon being unveiled, not to mention that many fans were happy to just assume he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">Only One Name</a>. You can generally divide the tone of any discussion on him by what name they use for him: people who exclusively call him "Palpatine" tend to be taking things fairly seriously, people who call him "Sheev Palpatine" are being excessively formal, and people who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">just call him "Sheev"</a> are <em>always</em> taking the piss.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> gave some implications that Rey might have connections to previous characters, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em> threw it all away saying her parents were nobodies who sold her for drink money. Such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">Anti-Climax</a> did not go lightly with certain fans. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em> reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's Palpatine's granddaughter, which satisfied most of the fans who were underwhelmed by Rey being a nobody... but annoyed the fans who <em>did</em> like the twist, and saw it as breaking the themes of <em>The Last Jedi</em> and raising even more questions in the process.</span>

Many fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">including Luke's actor Mark Hamill</a>, were dissatisfied with this explanation as clashing with Luke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">Ideal Hero</a> portrayal. Even those less critical found it flimsy given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Luke had gone through similar</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">almost killing Darth Vader</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">had far better justifications for Luke attempting such</a>.

</li><li> Many fans are also not having what <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoloAStarWarsStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoloAStarWarsStory">Solo</a></em> brought to the table like the unnecessary and out-of-nowhere explanation of how Han got his surname as well as how the infamous Kessel Run went about.
</li></ul></li><li> This is one of the biggest reasons why the director's/final cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em> is generally considered superior to the theatrical cut. The narration present in the latter removes all the ambiguity that makes the film a classic in the first place.
</li><li> One of the biggest complaints about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighlanderIITheQuickening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighlanderIITheQuickening">Highlander II: The Quickening</a></em> was that it established a mythology that the immortals are aliens from a planet known as Zeist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">which only serves to raise more questions.</a> The re-edits establish them as wizards from Earth's distant past. Either way, the film is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">no longer considered canon</a> with the rest of the series.
</li><li> Some people feel this way about the scene of Roy Neary inside the mothership from the special edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></em>. One of these people is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> himself, who had never wanted to do that scene in the first place but could only get the money to create a special edition if he included something that a marketing campaign could be hung on. Years later, Spielberg created a director's edition, which removed that scene but kept the other special edition scenes.
</li><li> In a rare example of the fan-disliked explanation happening <em>early</em> in a franchise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero">George A. Romero</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LivingDeadSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LivingDeadSeries">Living Dead Series</a></em> explains where the zombies are coming from early in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968">the first film.</a> However, the explanation of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty">"Radioactive Space Probe"</a> didn't quite catch on, and later zombie media generally refuses to concretely explain the origins of the living dead. The universally reviled <em>Night of the Living Dead: 30th Anniversary Edition</em> (a re-release of the movie with added scenes by John Romero, the original's co-writer) instead implies the zombie plague is demonic in origin.

Needless to say, fans of the anime thought the twist was stupid not only because it was a cliched explanation for how the Titans came to be, but the manga had yet to reveal the origin of the Titans at that time, and it was seen as an example of the movie being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em>:
<ul><li> The novelization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">the second film</a>, as well as Cameron's development notes, indicate that the T-1000 bypassed the "nothing dead can time travel" rule by being placed in a "flesh sac" that allowed it to fool the time machine. This explanation was disliked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">opening a number of plot holes</a> in the premise, and simply sounding silly. All subsequent entries into the series simply went with the explanation fans had assumed all along: that Mimetic Polyalloy is very good at mimicking flesh.
</li><li> There have been numerous explanations for why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>'s model of Terminator exists and is so popular. A deleted scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a></em> indicated that it was modeled on a US Army soldier named William Candy, but not only is the scene it's revealed outrageously over-the-top, but the fact that the US government was planning on creating flesh-covered Terminators also makes <em>no sense</em> and undoes the premise that they were Skynet's creation to begin with.
</li><li> The third film introduced the idea that mechanical Terminators are fueled by nuclear power cells, which have the ability to cause an atomic explosion if ruptured or overloaded. This was met with derision because it raised questions about why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICannotSelfTerminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICannotSelfTerminate">I Cannot Self-Terminate</a> rule exists; if a Terminator's target is trapped or incapacitated (such as Sarah at the end of the first film), that'd be a quick way to get rid of them. It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> in <em>that</em> film by that Terminator being a T-850 (a slightly more advanced model), but <em>Terminator Salvation</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a></em> made it standard for <em>every</em> mechanical model.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation">Terminator Salvation</a></em> introduced the idea that John Connor had to work his way up the ladder in the Resistance, as well as deal with a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">Arbitrary Skeptics</a> in the chain of command. Many fans felt that this demystified Kyle Reese's explanation in the first film (whereas humans had no idea how to fight back until Connor showed up); there was no question that Kyle was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">Unreliable Expositor</a>, but his version of events carried the right mix of horror and faint hope.

As a result, many fans feel that it would have been more satisfying if it weren't explained at all. Considering Fury's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> reputation, the idea that he was blinded by a <em>cat</em> didn't strike many people as a fitting backstory, particularly since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em> implied a <em>much</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">more dramatic story</a> and the reveal unfortunately changes a fittingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssBoast">Bad Ass Boast</a> to what sounds like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">an attempt on his part to over-dramatize a cat scratch</a>:

We know that something big and terrible is going to happen, and we've got everything, including the dark, dismal skies.

<ul><li> The reveal via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that Dumbledore is gay was not taken kindly by some fans and critics, who felt that it either went against their mental view of him, or they just thought it was bad representation. The reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dumbledore was once in love with Gellert Grindelwald, a dark wizard that can be considered Voldemort's precursor</span> likely didn't make things any better.
</li><li> Likewise, the reveal in the fifth book that while Lily's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to protect baby Harry from Voldemort and his followers used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>, the charm required Harry to be sent to live with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">the Dursleys</a> because he needed to live with a blood relative of Lily's in order for the protections to actually work. The Dursleys do <em>not</em> love Harry in the slightest, and at best they just simply begrudged his existence, yet they're allowed to count under a spell forged by love solely because Petunia is the only person alive that shares DNA with both Lily and Harry. Meanwhile, living with a genuinely loving family like the Weasleys, his equally loving godfather Sirius, a Muggle family Harry wasn't biologically related to, or even being raised in the foster system would not protect Harry simply because none of those potential guardians are blood relatives. This struck many fans as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">poorly-written plot convenience</a> to justify Harry living with his horrible relatives for as long as possible.

On top of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">raising hundreds of questions</a>, it was such a bizarre and disgusting claim that it became the prime example in the fanbase of why statements from Rowling are never to be trusted.

Nagini didn't have any relevance to the plot apart from being Voldemort's pet and Horcrux, and though she did show some signs of being intelligent, fans just assumed this meant she was either an unidentified species of magical snake (similar to Crookshanks), or that being turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a> rubbed off on her in some way. <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> revealed that she was actually a woman who had some kind of condition that caused her to turn into a snake, and by the time of the series, her condition had progressed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterModeLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterModeLock">Shapeshifter Mode Lock</a>. On the one hand, you had fans who were baffled at the fact that this backstory needed to exist to begin with.

On yet another hand, you had people who were confused as to how the 30s Nagini and the 90s Nagini could be the same person when the 30s Nagini showed no signs of being a cruel and inhuman monster, and were horrified at the fact that Neville's triumphant victory over her in the last book was now him killing what was essentially a disabled human being. And on the final hand, you had people being disgusted that the mention of "milking" Nagini in the fourth book, rather than referring to the real concept of harvesting snake venom, actually meant that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Voldemort was suckling her</a>—something Rowling even confirmed with unreleased concept art!

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">implied explanation</a> for why the Second Doctor and Jamie look visibly older in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors">The Three Doctors</a>", "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20thASTheFiveDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS20thASTheFiveDoctors">The Five Doctors</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E4TheTwoDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS22E4TheTwoDoctors">The Two Doctors</a>", resulting in the events <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nicknamed</a> "Season 6B", is still fairly controversial. The theory states that the reason the Doctor can't control the TARDIS is that the Time Lords had been piloting it for him without his knowledge, and after his capture at the end of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames">The War Games</a>", when the Time Lords appear to alter his appearance and exile him to Earth, he was actually used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">Boxed Crook</a> agent by the Time Lords for centuries until the sentence was carried out, during which he persuaded the Time Lords to let him have his beloved companion Jamie back. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> has absorbed this into canon on account of "making sense" and there are several books set during these events, but many fans dislike it for diminishing the beautiful conclusion to the Second Doctor's story, being improbable based on what we actually see in "The War Games" and being rather unnecessarily cruel, forcing the Second Doctor to go through the pain of losing his companions again.
</li><li> The Time Lords were introduced as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">Crystal Spires and Togas</a> civilization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> who were "cosmic Buddhists", believing in non-intervention except for occasional, inscrutable actions made from a point of omniscience and taken for the greater good (such as their use of both the Third and Fourth Doctors as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">Boxed Crooks</a>). Robert Holmes felt this was boring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a> that didn't fit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">his own worldview</a>, and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Watsonianly</a>, didn't jive with a few throwaway lines made by the Fourth Doctor (like complaining the Time Lords didn't want to sully their "lily-white hands"), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a> them irreparably into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a> made up of ritual-obsessed old bureaucrats of average intelligence wearing silly hats and backstabbing each other while the poor starve.

Notably, neither <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss">Mark Gatiss</a> liked this conception of the Time Lords and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon">what we see of them during RTD's tenure is a great deal more godly</a>, although not particularly sympathetic.

Holmes suggested to fans that the Doctor may have been lying, but since Sutekh was previously shown to be able to completely read the Doctor's mind, this doesn't seem very plausible.
</li><li> Many fans find the New series' explanation of the Master's turning towards evil (a pattern of pounding drums playing in his head all his life) to be unsatisfactory for many reasons — none of the previous Masters ever suggested it, and any explanation could only ever be disappointing after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">thirty-six years of speculation</a>. However, the fact that the explanation was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSimm">John Simm</a>'s Caligula (obsessed with the sound of pounding hooves in his head) and employed a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a> strongly suggests the explanation was intended to be limited to Simm's incarnation only — the succeeding Gomez incarnation hasn't mentioned drumming at all. The Simm Master in his appearance in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E11WorldEnoughAndTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E11WorldEnoughAndTime">World Enough and Time</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E12TheDoctorFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E12TheDoctorFalls">The Doctor Falls</a>", after resolving his issue with the Time Lords, completely abandons the drumming as an element of his character and is written (by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>) more as an arrogant Delgado-Master-type character (apart from the drumming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">Leitmotif</a> still appearing along with him).
</li><li> The new series made several references to the "Shadow Proclamation", which was apparently some sort of law that nearly every alien species obeyed. Fans speculated on the origins and nature of the Proclamation. Near the end of Tennant's run as the Doctor, it was revealed that the Shadow Proclamation is "a posh term for Space Police". So apparently the Proclamation is not a law but an organization, or if it <em>is</em> a law then there is apparently an organization of the same name which enforces the law. This is a bit like being arrested by "The Constitution" or something.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2a0rm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2a0rm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2a0rm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's less of a stretch to those of us who grew up in the age of "The Warsaw Pact".</span> It didn't go over very well with fans, and the Shadow Proclamation has barely been mentioned since the Reveal. Russell T. Davies stated the original idea for the Proclamation's appearance in "The Stolen Earth" was to include a large <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> prequel-style senate consisting of every single major known race in the galaxy, but going over the budget forced them to scale it down to what was essentially nothing more than a secretarial lobby.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime">The End of Time</a>", the Tenth Doctor gives a speech about what regeneration is, in which he explains it as being a death, where "some other man" saunters off. Many fans objected to this, pointing at situations where other incarnations had considered it a rebirth, a healing or a second chance, and thought the speech was a preemptive attempt to guilt-trip fans into considering his yet-to-debut successor a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Replacement Scrappy</a>. Later Eleventh Doctor episodes write this off as "ego problems" and the Twelfth Doctor calls regeneration "Man Flu" in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent">Hell Bent</a>".
</li><li> Davies also claimed that averting this trope was the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">the Last Great Time War</a> was never shown onscreen, as they felt that no matter how spectacular they made it the war would always seem anticlimactic to at least some fans. Successor showrunner Steven Moffat, however, thought he could do it justice and had the Time War appearing and playing a major role in the 50th anniversary special "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">The Day of the Doctor</a>"; many fans disagreed.
</li><li> Many fans objected to River's revelation that the characteristic TARDIS dematerialisation sound was the result of the Doctor <em>leaving the handbrake on</em> in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E4TheTimeOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E4TheTimeOfAngels">The Time of Angels</a>". Not only does this make the Doctor look like an idiot (although the idea he doesn't <em>really</em> know how to fly the TARDIS has been established for decades), but it fails to explain why other TARDISes make the same sound. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that River was probably just winding him up.

There's nothing in the story suggesting this is a nickname, but the fandom quickly decided it was and this became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fanon</a> nine years and three Doctors later in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E2TheHappinessPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E2TheHappinessPatrol">The Happiness Patrol</a>" (and also in a Sixth Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebook">Gamebook</a>).

Rather, he was <strong>scared</strong> of... <strong>something</strong>. No subsequent story has revealed what that was of yet. Thing is, after 50+ years fans came to accept that despite many teases, especially in the new series, the Doctor's backstory, real name, etc. will never be revealed in full because it would never live up to what they've seen him go through on his adventures. Thus, they were perfectly happy with him leaving Gallifrey "just because".

</div></li><li> Later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> had huge problems because of piling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> elements that were left unexplained or not addressed sufficiently, but one particular case was closed, and it was very anti-climactic. The fate of Samantha Mulder, Agent Fox Mulder's abducted little sister, was probably the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> of the series. Her abduction triggered Mulder's belief in the paranormal and motivated his career at the FBI and started the pattern of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex">Guilt Complex</a>. Mulder was tormented by her clones and doubles and statements that she's still alive. It was finally revealed that she had been abducted by the conspiracy who had collaborated with the aliens, horrible tests had been performed on her, and then she had lived with the Cancer Man's family. So far so good — fans always suspected something like this. However, when she was 14, she was "saved" by fairies or angels that made her body disappear, meaning that her corpse will never be found, but Mulder did see her ghost.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em>: The final season revealed why Lettie Mae was so abusive towards Tara: when Tara was young, her father abandoned them, causing Lettie Mae to descent into alcoholism and take out her frustrations on her daughter. Considering her treatment of Tara over the course of the show, most fans found it hard to believe something like that could actually happen to someone. Not to mention that such an important event in Tara and Lettie Mae's relationship should have been mentioned in the previous seasons. If anything, it comes off as a lazy attempt by the writers to conclude as many character arcs as possible before the series finale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars">Pretty Little Liars</a></em>: After six seasons of mystery and false suspects, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">A</a> is finally revealed to be Cece Drake, also known as Charles DiLaurentis, Alison's brother who had a sex change operation. This was a huge source of controversy, and some viewers said there were too many unanswered questions while others pointed out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> of the show's only transgender character being the primary antagonist.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>: The final arc heavily hints that Dexter's homicidal tendencies might have been sustained, or even heightened, rather than treated, by the Code he's been taught — it turns out that a certain psychiatrist was obsessed with the concept, after failing to treat her own, truly homicidal, son. Even so, in the finale Dexter decides he is a monster after all, and goes into exile.

</li><li> The Link from the <em>Oracle</em> games is the same Link from <em>A Link To The Past</em> according to Hyrule Historia.

Many fans took issue with how most of the paranormal events in both it and the previous games were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">explained away with nanomachines</a>, how the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> likable supporting cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em></span> were revealed to be the originators of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">The Patriots</a>, how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Big Boss</span> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">brought back</a> in the most contrived way possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItSeemedLikeAGoodIdeaAtTheTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItSeemedLikeAGoodIdeaAtTheTime">denounce his character-defining ideals</a> and how Liquid Snake's return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em> was undermined (and arguably retconned) by the reveal that Liquid Ocelot <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in <em>Guns of the Patriots</em> is just Ocelot under hypnosis.</span> Some fans have even argued that the very existence of <em>Guns of the Patriots</em> as a sequel to <em>Sons of Liberty</em> undermines the meta-narrative of the latter game, as Kojima never intended to wrap up the loose ends (at least not himself) and indeed was trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaTwist">communicate something by leaving them ambigious</a>. This is substantiated by the fact that mass outrage and death threats from the fanbase was what forced him to develop <em>4</em>.
</li><li> While the release of more games starring Big Boss has been welcomed by many fans, others have pointed out that it waters down the powerful ending of <em>Snake Eater</em>, which poetically illustrates exactly how Big Boss became the bad guy he was in the original games through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Boss' death.</span>
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV">Metal Gear Solid V</a></em> has been met with controversy for how it somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">cynically explains the makings of Big Boss' legendary status</a> in the games starring Solid Snake: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's revealed that Big Boss turned one of his own men into a hypnotized body double that could act as his persona on the world stage while the real Big Boss could hide from his enemies.</span>
<ul><li> On an interesting note, some have praised <em>The Phantom Pain</em> for how it managed to make Zero's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> turn to villainy</span> seem more plausible. However, if you were completely turned off by this reveal in <em>Guns of the Patriots</em>, this might not do much to change your mind.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> runs on this: the game developer, ZUN, decided to leave most canon details vague and background/personalities open to detail since he found that the openness to interpretation of the games is what attracted such a large fanbase. There are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">expanded universe</a> materials - which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">usually include subversions of popular fan interpretations</a> - which often cause flamewars to break out over the canonicity, or are disregarded or changed by fans.
</li><li> Likewise, one of the many reasons <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl">Star Control</a> 3</em> is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">Fanon Discontinuity</a> by many is because it answered all the major cosmic mysteries brought up in <em>Star Control 2</em>, in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infodump">infodump</a> that takes four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> videos to cover.

The developers of the first two games would later render the third game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX">Ultima IX</a></em> revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Guardian</a> was actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout">Enemy Without</a> created from the Player Character's evil which was cast aside when the latter became the Avatar in <em>IV</em></span>. This was considered rather underwhelming (after several games and almost 10 years of build-up), as well as somewhat inconsistent with the previously established story (<em>VII</em> and especially <em>Underworld II</em> implied he was a full blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiversalConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiversalConqueror">Multiversal Conqueror</a>). It's also felt by many fans to be contrary to the lore and the entire moral of the forth game that the Avatar is still a flawed human being.
</li><li> One of the main complaints of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> was how some of the plot threads were either given haphazard resolutions or dropped entirely. Most however, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuri's vigilante actions,</span> were given decent resolutions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianTwilight">Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight</a></em> set out to resolve the many questions surrounding Kane, but it's agreed by most of the fanbase that it simply created <em>more</em> questions.

</li><li> Several fans didn't like the reveal that Lusamine, the main antagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">used to be a morally decent person, before a combination of grief over the disappearance her husband Mohn, (all but outright stated to be the same Mohn running the Poke Pelago mini-game, having lost his memories in said disappearance) and neurotoxin from the Ultra-Beast Nihilego drove her insane</span>. This basically boiled down to them feeling that this reveal whitewashed her actions, up to and including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbuse">emotional and verbal abuse</a>, robbed the story of any real villain apart from Faba, and/or was just a lazy attempt at humanizing her.

Much of this was caused by a lack of explanation of the events of the ending, but many disliked the explanation for the existence of the Reapers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Which is that they are synthetics created to destroy organics... so that they cannot create synthetics that will destroy organics. The Reapers don't consider what they do to organics to be "destroying organic life," but since it involves liquefying them and building a new Reaper out of the resulting goo, most organics (and players) consider it a meaningless distinction.</span> The fact that an early draft of the script containing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a> potentially a much more interesting explanation leaked months before the game's release didn't help. The Extended Cut DLC went some way to appeasing the fandom, by showing in more detail the consequences of whatever decision Shepard makes, as well as including new scenes to each ending so that they were no longer identical as before. It, along with the later Leviathan DLC, also revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the AI that created the Reapers was acting out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion">Zeroth Law Rebellion</a> caused by flawed instructions from its creators.</span>

This is a threefold case: fans don't like how the mystery and horror of the animatronics is given a sci-fi explanation; as an explanation for how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Michael Afton haunts his own corpse</span> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation">the last game</a>, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">raises further questions</a>; and as a possible explanation for the Purple Guy/William Afton's motives (which is further suggested by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveNightsAtFreddysTheFourthCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveNightsAtFreddysTheFourthCloset">the third novel</a>), it turns a hauntingly realistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> into a cartoonish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>.

Some reject it because both games have some of the most unique, detailed, and complete worldbuilding in the series, so going with this theory involves attempting to reconcile different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">magic rules</a>, afterlife mythologies, historical details, and so on. Some don't like it because it involves a reasonably sympathetic character being indirectly responsible for nearly killing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance">living planet</a>. Some don't like <em>X-2</em> and think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wanking</a> it to <em>VII</em> is mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDefilement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDefilement">Canon Defilement</a>.

</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> example is the existence of Garona Halforcen from the original RTS games. In those games, she is described as half-human, which worked at the time, as there were no details about the length the First War between the Orcs and Humans. About a decade worth of retcons later, suddenly her being half-human and as old as she was made no sense. So they retconned her into a half draenei who had her body manipulated to <em>appear</em> half human. This was met with varying degrees of acceptance to annoyance, particularly because it was part of a story dealing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">a very controversial character</a> (her son).

Fans reacted by rejecting both opinions, arguing that the former was feeding misinformed negative stereotypes about anti-depressants as being a "luxury" rather than an actual necessity and that the latter was bland and uninteresting. Instead, fans created and latched onto the idea that Joy is a metaphor for how countries (particularly police states) cover up their atrocities and poor situations with propaganda instead of admitting the truth, especially about their compliance in these things.

In the original games, it's implied that Revan and Malak fell to the Dark Side either as a result of their search for the Star Forge or intentionally to protect the galaxy from "the True Sith". As a result, a <em>lot</em> of fans were annoyed with the book's explanation that they only went to the Dark Side <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to being brainwashed by the Sith Emperor, ruler of the aforementioned True Sith and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em></span>.

Then one of the shorts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">torpedoed that headcanon</a> by having her declare she won it bobbing for apples at a fair.

</li><li> Nightmare Moon's origin was left mysterious for several seasons and thus most fans were under the impression Luna's turn into Nightmare Moon was purely the result of her giving in to her own feelings of being overshadowed and under-appreciated by the ponies of Equestria. The IDW comics, however, gave a backstory that Luna that stated she was transformed by outside sources. Though whether the comics are canon or not is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">rather spicy topic</a>, many fans never the less dislike this explanation because they felt it took away a lot of what made Nightmare Moon, and subsequently Luna's backstory, interesting. The season 4 opener, which shows Luna becoming Nightmare Moon, also reveals that Nightmare Moon was defeated before doing anything worse than trying to bring about eternal night and managing to briefly knock out Celestia, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnticlimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnticlimaxBoss">disappointing for such an anticipated event</a> and made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">Luna's guilt over it</a> come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">silly and overblown</a> to some fans, to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> unless they take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFiendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFiendshipIsMagic">later comics</a> as canon.

The implication Luna and Celestia weren't born alicorns irked many fans who headcanoned them as from a race of natural alicorns.

Though King Thorax and Ocellus are quite popular, it's very telling that even after a couple of years, the majority of changeling fan-art and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter">Original Characters</a> are still depicted in their old forms even if they are good-aligned characters.

All the threats were due <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">their leaving them to Twilight to prepare her</a> which the episode implies but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">is suspect given unexpectedness of most of the threats and their poor performance when they did act</a>.</span> would provided a better explanation than what was given. Even those who don't pull <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">Fanon Discontinuity</a> on their retiring ignore the stated reason as suspect bordering on factually incorrect.
