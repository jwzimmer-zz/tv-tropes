Nothing is as depressing as having to correct the teacher, except not doing so for fear of the teacher getting mad. Sometimes they use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, but if their parents demand grades, and they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">get them</a>, their classmates can get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">jealous</a>, which can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">bullying of various sorts</a>.

</p><p>Depending on which neuroscientific theory one subscribes to, the trope name is quite literal: Those with more intelligence have a higher rate of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">disorders of some kind</a> that can factor heavily in inducing social isolation. This is especially true if they attend a school with separate programs for people with those disorders, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergerSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergerSyndrome">students within the autism spectrum</a> (regardless of what specific disorders they show), taking tests separately from other students along with extended time.

There are examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">smart people who are popular with others</a> but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">still feel that their intelligence isolates them</a>. It's pretty difficult to find common ground when explaining your thoughts bores or bewilders others, after all. Of course, if the intelligent one is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> then lack of intersocial skills or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">tendencies to assume superiority</a> probably play a much bigger part in their isolation than merely being smart or mental issues, feigned or otherwise.
</p><p>This may be portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>, either showing that this isn't something you would want to strive to become, or that the person who is always on their own isn't quite the freak everyone thinks they are.
</p><p>A form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>.

A counter-part trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularIsDumb">Popular Is Dumb</a>. May or may not include elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">Loners Are Freaks</a>. Often used as a justification for why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">Dumb Is Good</a>: dumb people may be made fun of, but they won't be hassled and harassed for it.

<ul><li> Oz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em>. He may act stupid, but he's incredibly intelligent...and he doesn't have many friends besides Gil, Alice, Sharon, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Elliot and Leo.</a>
<ul><li> Leo plays this trope very straight. He's able to see things no one else can and as a result is isolated from others. Even at the orphanage no one understood him until Elliot showed up.
</li><li> Oswald and Lacie would count as well. Lacie is incredibly smart, but the fact that she's seen as some sort of Apocalypse Maiden doesn't help her status, any, either. Oswald is just shy and everyone assumes he's cold.
</li></ul></li><li> Homura Akemi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>. Seen as shy and super clumsy in earlier installments, people called her useless. Later on, Homura appears to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> and is admired by everyone from afar <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> thanks to the acquired experience from the time loops</span>; Sayaka mistakenly thinks she's full of herself, when in reality she's trying to act rationally and be sane at the same time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> since she's keeping an eye on Madoka so she won't die or become a witch like in said former installments.</span>
</li><li> Ami Mizuno from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> was the smartest girl in all of Japan, but until Usagi recruited her as Sailor Mercury, she didn't have any friends at school. All the kids thought she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">an arrogant know-it-all</a>, but she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShyBlueHairedGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShyBlueHairedGirl">just shy and reserved</a>. See what her fellow students say about her in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">R movie</a>:
<div class="indent">"Ah, Mizuno-san got the first place again!"
</div><div class="indent">"She always shows off about her good grades, but she doesn't get that she's getting such a bad rep!"
</div></li><li> L, Mello, and Near of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. Light is the "well-liked and admired but feels very alone" variant. Maybe even the author - he certainly likes this trope.
<ul><li> Well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist">the writer</a> certainly states that he "did well at school" and that he doesn't "leave [his] house very much" in How To Read 13.
</li><li> Near is the <em>definition</em> of this trope. Thanks to his genius-level intelligence and his (implied) Asperger's Syndrome, the white-haired boy is completely unable to associate with people on a daily basis. The only ones who have direct contact with him are his subordinates of the SPK. Hell, his social skills and life skills rating in <em>How To Read</em> are both a meager 2/10.
</li></ul></li><li> Ren Hiyama of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LostBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LostBrain">Lost+Brain</a></em>. His sidekick Haruhide Shitara too.
</li><li> Lelouch "Lamperouge" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. Admittedly, it's also due to his issues with letting people get close to him stemming from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">his traumatic childhood experiences</a>.
<ul><li> ...And the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">he's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">undercover</a> 95% percent of the time, not to mention his criminal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> once the plot starts. Actually, when it doesn't interfere too much with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">plans</a> or comes without too many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">strings attached</a>, he <em>does</em> have a good time with his friends.
<ul><li> His disaffection with everyone and everything (including his pal Rivalz) in episode one is this mixed with philosophical disdain for the society he belongs to. Which causes him to go try to help out a wrecked truck that everyone else is just taking cameraphone pictures of. Which gets him mixed up with terrorists and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseMaiden">Apocalypse Maiden</a> who gives him superpowers. Which starts everything.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru">Narutaru</a></em>'s Tomonori Komori and Naozumi Sudo.
<ul><li> Also, Hiroko Kaizuka. Then she became the victim of <em>very</em> cruel bullies...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkagamiNoShirayukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkagamiNoShirayukihime">Akagami no Shirayukihime</a></em>: People around the palace consider Ryuu creepy because of his high intelligence at a young age and his interest in poisonous plants and tend to avoid him. Later, in part thanks to his friendship with Shirayuki, he gets a few friends and becomes less isolated. As an introvert with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> Ryuu is not the most social of people to begin with.
</li><li> Ishida Uryuu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, while also the indubitable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>, qualifies. Before getting involved with Ichigo &amp; co., there is zero indication that he has any friends, nor that he EVER has. Part of this is a result of his acting like a jerk because it's "cool" / to keep people away, but he wasn't always like that. Add seeing ghosts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the loss of most of his family</span> to the brain, and it's no wonder he's a loner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>
<ul><li> Hiroki Sawada from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a> <em>Phantom of Baker Street</em>. Either his school system couldn't quite deal with the child who would be studying grad school in MIT at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">ten</a></em>, or he was given a highly accelerated homeschooling. Either way, he is friendless against his will— which accumulated to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> status in the movies, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">he just wanted to have friends</a>.

While he wasn't <em>openly</em> shunned by his peers, and in fact he briefly was a member of the soccer club in his junior high, it's mentioned sometimes that teachers and classmates found him arrogant and hard to approach — and sometimes were (and still are) <em>amazed</em> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatientChildhoodLoveinterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatientChildhoodLoveinterest">Ran</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">ever</a> managed to befriend him.

As Shiho, she was raised by the Organization to become one of their top scientists by the age of thirteen, and her only close relationship was her elder sister, Akemi. Akemi's death is the catalyst that led to Shiho turning on the Organization and becoming Ai in the first place.

</li><li> A recurring trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em>, where both the protagonist and the villain feel solitude and isolation despite the physical presence of others. In Johan, this is manifested in an extreme way in his "Landscape of the End" (though, admittedly, there are factors aside from intelligence that figure in here).
<ul><li> Nina/Anna and Johan are a little unusual: their natural intelligence and trauma-induced solitude don't seem to be related. Runge would fit this trope better, but even in his case it's not really intelligence but workaholism that isolates him, to the point that his family abandons him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Until the end, where he's in contact with his kid again.</span>

This revelation puts a whole new significance to the lengths he went to to give The Children a chance to go to school like normal children.... basically, he gave them the childhood that was denied him.
</li><li> Kiyomaro "Kiyo" Takamine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell">Zatch Bell!</a></em> - he'd basically stopped going to school or caring about anything else because his fellow students were so hostile to his smarts. Except Suzu, the one student who was a girl at the absolute other end of the smarts scale, and he had not befriended her yet. It got to the point where it was going both ways, his fellow students treated him with hostility but he'd grown so used to it he was acting as stuck up as everyone thought he was. After meeting Gash he lightens up and once he starts being genuinely nice again his classmates do as well easily bonding with him through his intelligence with things like helping them study and providing advice.
</li><li> Sakurako Amamiya has been the textbook brainy loner ever since she's been drawn into the madness of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Psyren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Psyren">Psyren</a></em>, shutting herself from everyone so as not to let anyone else be damaged by it. We know she hasn't always been like this because, just as she is introduced, Ageha remembers a time when, as a child, she was much more joyful and open to the world.

Mashiro, Misaki and Ryuunosuke are all extremely talented and eccentric in some way, but that mostly brings them troubles since they have little to no friends, their peers either label them as freaks or resent their talent and their teachers consider them problem children.
</li><li> Mikogami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei">Sekirei</a></em> turns out to have suffered from this in the past, being a 15-year old college graduate and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">Lonely Rich Kid</a>. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> tendencies probably didn't help matters, as he claimed his peers were "stupid" and there was no way he could ever relate to them.

He's the top student in his school, so focused on his studies that he sees things as socializing with others or trying to seek romance as distractions. Then again, much of this is implied to be rooted on the fact that he wants to secure a good job for the future and help his family out of their poverty.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> is often shown with a dismissive attitude towards other heroes, as if they were children playing at adult matters. It is shown that Bats has crippling intimacy issues due to the whole "shaping my entire life around having watched my parents' murder as a child" thing, so it's not just intellect for him. After his parents died, he grew up in a big hurry, and flashbacks of his childhood after it happened show him as having been too serious and somber to play with other children.
<ul><li> Furthermore, he is painfully aware of these attributes and while he often doesn't have the best relationship with his fellow heroes, he does care about them and there are some that he is quite close with such as Superman. He also carries this same relationship with the Justice League and other members composing the Bat-Family who aid Batman on his ventures.
</li><li> This gets explored in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> where decades into the future, Bruce has inadvertently driven most of the people close to him out of his life.

This intelligence and isolation also makes him quite ignorant to the point of disobedience of his fellow superhero allies and even placing his son, Franklin Richards, into a coma state.
<ul><li> Allysa Moy, an old friend of Reed's, tries to seduce him with this trope as the friends Reed surrounds himself with just aren't on her and Reed's level. Reed doesn't give a damn.
</li><li> Reed Richards and Doctor Doom are archenemies and worthy opponents to each other partly because their intelligence is on par with each other. They don't need to talk down to each other to be understood, though Doom does it anyway out of arrogance.

Because of this, she was unable to relate to anyone her own age except through dancing. After joining the X-Men and acquiring even more knowledge (including things not meant for someone her age), this became a lot worse. It is sometimes implied that this is the reason why she always seeks relationships with guys much older than her.
<ul><li> This might affect her more than people think. After joining S.H.I.E.L.D. she found a fellow agent who was as young and as intelligent as her; she immediately proceeded to develop feelings for him and not much later decided to cheat on her current boyfriend Pete Wisdom with this agent. Nothing actually happened between them but the idea of her being fine with cheating because this guy was her age and at her intellectual level was enough for Wisdom to break up with her.

The version of the character in the graphic novel seems comfortable and resigned with this status, but in the movie there are a few indications that he is in fact very lonely because of it, and turned to his historical interests as a distraction:
<div class="indent"><em>"I guess you could say I've always been alone. I mean, they say I'm the smartest man in the world, but the truth is I've often felt stupid at being unable to relate to anybody. Well... anyone living, that is."</em>

</li><li> This was the life of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero">Otto</a> before the start of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HIVESeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HIVESeries">H.I.V.E.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em> is a classic example of this. His genius often causes him considerable frustration when dealing with other people (including the official police force), and as a result he prefers to follow his own route to a solution. He chooses only those cases which truly interest him intellectually, and involves only those people who are useful for his current case. Aside from his brother Mycroft Holmes and his loyal friend Doctor John Watson, he spends most of his time alone, broadening his eclectic range of knowledge. When he feels he has nothing to work on his brilliant mind becomes a burden, sometimes driving him to seek a drug-induced stupor as an alternative to the mundane. Mycroft and Dr. Watson appear to be the only two people whose company Holmes actively seeks out, and who are able to tolerate his often acerbic or dark moods, while maintaining a genuine liking for him. Although Holmes does express admiration occasionally for individuals who present above average intelligence (in his opinion) he doesn't seem to have any close friends outside of Watson and Mycroft, and appears to prefer isolation. Mycroft on the other hand is even MORE of this, to the point of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>. He prefers his own company to the extent that he <em>started a club whose members are forbidden to speak to each other</em>.

Sprague de Camp</a>, a scientific genius has discovered an atomic principle that could potentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">destroy the planet</a>. Most of the story is a flashback to his unhappy life of being unpopular and bullied and lonely. He decides to publish his discovery, expecting it to lead to humanity destroying itself. His description, as narrator, of his detachment from people and deeply-buried violent rage is kind of unsettling. A modern reader might be tempted to wonder if he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">undiagnosed mental health issues.</a>
</li><li> Raistlin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em>, whose exceptional intelligence sets him apart from other characters (although his loneliness is also because, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks">Being Evil Sucks</a>). In fact he also sets himself apart deliberately, because he resents that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath">extreme</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">physical frailty</a> makes him heavily reliant on others.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a>'s only friends are his bodyguard and a small group of subterrainina (technologically advanced faeries). It's said that he's "bamboozled" every IQ test sent his way and driven several psychiatrists gibbering back into their own wards. However, it's shown that he does have the capabilities and charisma to actually charm people and hold down relationships: he simply doesn't bother because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">he doesn't respect most other people</a>, a fact pointed out by one of the few psychiatrists able to shut him up.

<ul><li> This is something of a theme in the Tiffany Aching-arc. Witches are without exception isolated from the people they help, and must constantly work to keep from getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">a God-complex</a>, or simply going mad from loneliness, a condition known among them as "cackling".

She does not have much of a social life and spends most of her time on her computer. She's secretly jealous of her less intelligent sister Claudia because she has a lot of friends.
</li><li> Charlotte Johanssen. In the third book it's revealed that she's ostracized and bullied by her classmates for being so smart. They make fun of Charlotte and call her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeachersPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeachersPet">Teacher's Pet</a>. She gets to skip a grade, which resolves the issue.
</li><li> Rosie Wilder is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> not just at academics (she's as smart as Janine), but extremely talented at everything. However she's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Broken Ace</a> hated by all her classmates. It helps that, unlike the two examples above, Rosie is kind of an obnoxious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> and as a result no one gets along with her, not even fellow genius Janine.

</li><li> Implied for one girl in a camping "episode": she doesn't join the girls' activities and prefers to read by herself; likewise the other girls don't talk to her. She comes into her own when the girls get lost on a hike, saving everyone because the book she was reading was about the outdoors and she was the only one who knew how to read the trail markers. Sadly, the last we hear of her is her mother telling the counsellor that she definitely won't be back next summer.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the people exiled from the society of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em> have high intelligence, due to their frustration with the shallow nature of their society. Others are invited to join the government, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">Lonely at the Top</a>, as we see with Mustapha Mond.
</li><li> The two protagonists of Muriel Barbery's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEleganceOfTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEleganceOfTheHedgehog">The Elegance of the Hedgehog</a></em>.
</li><li> In Christopher Stasheff's <em>The Witch Doctor,</em> from his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWizardInRhyme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWizardInRhyme">A Wizard in Rhyme</a>" series, the main character complained to an angel that he never had any friends as a kid because nobody else in the neighborhood was interested in reading. The angel's reply was that he should have <em>pretended</em> to be interested in the same things as the other kids and then he might've had friends (although the series <em>did</em> take place in a medieval universe with decidedly different values...).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongOfTheLioness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongOfTheLioness">Song of the Lioness</a></em>, Alanna's twin brother Thom is one of the most powerful sorcerers in Tortall. The only person he's close to at all is Alanna because he believes that his teachers are jealous and he has no interest in getting close to anyone else. He didn't even like their first teacher, Maude, and only listened to her as long as he thought she could still help him.
</li><li> Lisbeth Salander in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMillenniumTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMillenniumTrilogy">The Millennium Trilogy</a>". She is brilliant-has a photographic memory, extremely skilled at computer hacking, reads math books and solves mathematical equations for fun, and yet has close to no friends. Her brilliance is recognized by a few of the characters who get to know her (Blomkvist, Mirium Wu, Armansky) but for the most part she is so asocial and unresponsive that she was declared incompetent by psychologists.
</li><li> Kirsty in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy">Johnny Maxwell Trilogy</a></em>, who has a habit of explaining to people how stupid they are until they leave (she views this as a character flaw in everyone else). Johnny is her friend because he <em>already</em> thinks he's pretty stupid.
</li><li> Minor example in the novel <em>Hush Money</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spenser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Spenser">Spenser</a> is interviewing his client, a college professor, about his romantic history in an effort to clear him of having had a relationship with a student that resulted in suicide. The professor, a black man, says that most of his relationships have been with white women; not because of their race, but because he is "badly over-educated", and only relates well to women who are also well-educated, and most of those women are white.
</li><li> Seemingly subverted, but actually played straight with John Rumford, the protagonist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em>. Rumford, a brilliant strategist, military theorist, polymath and polyglot, is a charismatic leader who inspires his subordinates... but <em>privately</em>, he is quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">Lonely at the Top</a>, with a bare handful of close friends, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAlone">Dying Alone</a> eventually</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BreedsThereAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BreedsThereAMan">Breeds There a Man...?</a>": Dr Ralston finds himself so much smarter than everyone around him that he has trouble tolerating their inability to grasp "simple" concepts. His psychiatrist describes this isolation to the project manager as analogous to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">force field</a>.
<div class="indent">"Whatever difference there is between his mind and that of others, it has built a wall between him and society as strong as the force field you are trying to design. For similar reasons, he has been unable to enjoy a normal sex life. He has never married; he has had no sweethearts."

<ul><li> All the guys in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> were isolated and picked on at school. Well, except Raj, whose family wealth shielded him but left him so traumatized he is unable to even speak aloud in a woman's presence. The writers of the show decided to explore this trope some more by giving Sheldon his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungSheldon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungSheldon">own spin-off</a> set in the 80s where he was 9 years old and struggling to make any friends since his high IQ and intelligence made him obsessed with correcting everybody around him.
</li></ul><ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carrusel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carrusel">Carrusel</a></em>. Maria Joaquina and Jorge may be brilliant students who have trouble making friends... but the reason for their difficulty has nothing to do with intelligence- it is due to Maria Joaquina and Jorge being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">snobbish and condescending</a> towards other students not as wealthy as they are. Maria Joaquina gets somewhat better after a while, as she's subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a> and becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch">Lovable Alpha Bitch</a> afterwards; Jorge keeps being haughty and snotty until almost the end instead. Averted by Daniel, who is the top student in the class and comes from an upper middle class family- though nowhere near as wealthy as Maria Joaquina or Jorge- yet has many friends and is the leader of La Patrulla Salvadora.
</li><li> Dr. Spencer Reid from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> can attest to this trope - he graduated from high school at age twelve and on at least one occasion was tied naked to a football goalpost and mocked.
</li><li> Gil Grissom on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>, often thought of as a bit of a recluse while he was team leader. He did become close to the others on the team; a family dynamic showed up as time went on, though it took six seasons for Sara to finally break down the walls he'd put up and form a romance with him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E4TheSontaranStratagem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E4TheSontaranStratagem">"The Sontaran Stratagem"</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E5ThePoisonSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E5ThePoisonSky">"The Poison Sky"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> Luke Rattigan invokes this, claiming that the fact that he and his fellow geniuses were excluded and laughed at by others is why they deserve to live more than "those cattle", and is why he helps the Sontarans' plan to poison the Earth. Unfortunately for him, he's the <em>only</em> one of them who feels that way; the others are much more well-adjusted and want to find their families when the poison gas crisis hits. Rattigan is reduced to impotently ranting that this "proves" he's cleverer than them.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em> episode "A, My Name Is Alex" heavily implies that Alex experienced this kind of treatment in his childhood years. In addition to putting mountains of pressure on him over it, his teacher would also frequently make it clear how smart he was in front of his class to the point that the other kids refused to associate with him; but lucky for him he managed to make a friend in Greg who's death is being currently grieved over at the moment.
</li><li> River Tam of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> was very much this during her younger years. She corrected the teachers often, and no one understood her, leading to her not being invited back to class. And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">the Academy happened</a>. Simon doesn't seem to have been much better at it, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">his social skills improve noticeably over the course of the series</a>.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> and Niles Crane, who were bullied severely and persistently throughout their childhoods and, as their father notes, never made many friends, which is partly why they are so much more close-knit than most successful adult siblings, although they still bicker quite frequently. It often comes across that while Frasier is an example of the trope compared to "normal people", Niles is an example compared to <em>Frasier</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>. And not just the title character either. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatientOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatientOfTheWeek">Patient of the Week</a> in "Ignorance is Bliss".

</div></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em>, Nate shows how difficult this really is. It is directly pointed out during the "Boys Night Out Job" that he really doesn't have any real friends apart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">the team</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicablyDivorced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmicablyDivorced">his ex wife</a>. He was good friends with Sterling when they worked for the insurance company. However, this only serves to reinforce this trope, as Sterling is just as smart and calculating as Nate.
</li><li> Malcolm from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em> makes this the focus for the first few seasons, before getting past it.
<ul><li> In fact, this contributes to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">Misaimed Fandom</a> - him being able to get past it in the later seasons is shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. Early on, nobody seems to want to interact with him aside from his brothers and a few others...but in High school, he finds people he has stuff in common with, and doesn't push them away.

</li><li> Alex in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em> is asked by her sister, "Do you want to be smart or do you want to be popular?" Unfortunately, in that particular episode anyway, she caves. One episode even had her parents nagging her to study less.

<ul><li> One episode has Homer's I.Q raised to slightly above average levels, and suffers from this, although it allows him to bond with Lisa. He ends up choosing blissful ignorance over the social stigma he'd caused—but was smart enough to write a heartfelt letter to her beforehand, apologizing for taking the easy way out and admiring her strength and courage.
</li><li> This trope is played straight to the point that Lisa flat-out made a graph stating the negative correlation between happiness and intelligence.
<ul><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">broken</a> by the fact that Homer never made an effort to put his high IQ to good use: he isolated everyone by virtue of spoiling movie endings, disillusioning people of hard-held beliefs and basically being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> with a high IQ.
</li></ul></li><li> The odd thing about this example, is that he really isn't particularly intelligent. He is treated as being very intelligent by everyone, including his coworkers, despite having a stated IQ of 105. This puts him at the upper end of average overall, and below average for highly technical jobs such as, for example, working in a nuclear power facility. In addition, his isolation was a result of him doing his job competantly, resulting in the plant having to be shut down until it's brought up to code, resulting in costing alot of people their jobs.
</li><li> Played with in the first-season episode "Bart the Genius," where Bart switches his intelligence test with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Martin Prince's</a> to fake being a genius.

<ul><li> High School issues and bullying aside, studies do show that people with significantly different IQ scores do have trouble relating. 15 IQ points difference is a small impediment but 30 IQ points typically makes it difficult (which is the minimum difference between someone perfectly average and someone classified gifted in the public school system.) Though of course, personality plays a major factor. Bookish and intelligent kids tend to be more reserved and quiet, while the average child is more outgoing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">and thus becomes popular.</a>
</li><li> Another study showed that more intelligent people often had a greater predilection towards clinical depression. While misery loves company, company certainly doesn't like misery.
</li><li> Even in day to day work life a difference in intelligence can make what could be a great friendship or great friendships not easy to have.
</li><li> In an extreme example, serial killers tend to fall on the extreme ends of the IQ spectrum. Either quite low (high 70s to low 90s) or quite high (130+ seems to be the cutoff). This could indeed be another instance of 'unable to relate'.
</li><li> The great mathematician Berhard Riemann was painfully shy, with few friends outside of his tightly knit family. This has given us the ironic situation that we know far less about the inner life of one of the greatest intuitive mathematicians of all time than about his contemporary the incredibly austere proto-formalist Weierstrass.
</li><li> The same goes for Henry Cavendish, who went so far as to avoid speaking with people completely, and his servants gave him food through a dumbwaiter. It's likely he had some personality disorder, but we don't know what it was.
</li><li> Paul Dirac, the man who formulated the equation that predicted the existence of antimatter, was so introverted that one of his best friends spent years not knowing what Dirac's initials stood for. Dirac also only accepted the Nobel Prize when it was pointed out that he would be subject to more attention for refusing it than he would for accepting it.
</li><li> Cults take advantage of this trope, employing 'love-bombing'— the tactic of showering a potential recruit with affection and attention in the hopes they'll stick around. Many people assume cult members are idiots who are easily taken in, but in fact cult members frequently have higher IQs. Then when they realize they're in a dangerous cult, they have difficulty leaving because of the love and attention they'd been showered with up to that point.
</li><li> The internet has made it extremely easy for people who want to discuss topics they're specifically interested in, including more "intelligent" topics, to find like-minded individuals. There quite a few people who, on the surface, seem like loners who are completely uninterested in any sort of socialization, but are actually very active in online discussions.
</li><li> Just as it is easy to hide "crazy" (as in the dangerous type of crazy) online, one can also hide social awkwardness as well. Those who appear glib and witty in print can have trouble with in-person, real time conversation where how you say something (body language) is as important as what you say. Also, if said person were to speak in the same way they write, it would result in stilted dialogue.
