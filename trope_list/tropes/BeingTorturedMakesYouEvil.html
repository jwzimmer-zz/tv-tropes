<div class="indent">— <strong>Zaeed Massani</strong>, summing this trope up for both sides, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>
</div></div><p>Need someone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, but the individual is uncooperative? No worries, just strap them to a table and go to town for a while. That's right, if you inflict enough pain on someone, they WILL be consumed by hatred and turn evil. Somehow. Sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> by throwing the word '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashing</a>' around, but more often than not, it comes down to this simple theory: Pain is bad, so if you add enough pain to someone, they become bad!

You'd think the newly evil victim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">might turn their newfound lack of morality toward the guy that did this to them, preferably in a manner similar to what the villain did to them</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> might factor in depending on how the torture was inflicted. In some cases, also, the torture was so horrific as to give the torturer a psychological hold on the victim, terrifying them into obedience. Also, sometimes the newly-evil victim <em>isn't</em> loyal to their torturer, but their ordeal has "opened their eyes" to the wretchedness of existence, birthing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilist</a>.

<ul><li> Ciel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> epitomizes this trope, going from an innocent, carefree child to a cold-hearted and icy one after being kidnapped and tortured on his tenth birthday. His dearest wish in life is to inflict merciless pain to those who did it to him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>: In a cross-series example, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rika</span> eventually gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">a happy ending</a>, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rikas</span> of the many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">alternate universes</a> do not, and they eventually all culminate in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bernkastel</span>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em>.
</li><li> Most of the Diclonius in (the necessarily shortened anime form of) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>. Though at the very least the evil one that was on her tormentors' side had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash">Explosive Leash</a> to keep her in check.
</li><li> Griffith of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is a marginal example. While his torture did leave him permanently maimed, that by itself wasn't enough. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his rescue by the Band of the Hawk, his heart broke when it became clear they weren't willing to carry around a mute, immobile lump of a former leader, but he thought he still had Casca on his side. It was learning that Casca not only agreed with the rest of the band on his uselessness, but was <em>in a relationship with his former protege Guts</em>, that finally sent him past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>.</span> The torture just got the ball rolling; it was the aftereffects that sent him over the edge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Years of child abuse by his stepfather</a> turned Seto Kaiba into the cold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> that he is.
</li><li> Slightly less extreme example, but after the shift from the horror genre of the initial manga, creator Kazuki Takashi implied that Yami Yugi was aware of the 3,000 years passing in the Puzzle, which was responsible for his single-minded pursuit of punishing anyone who hurt Yugi after being initially released. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">He grows out of it.</a>
</li><li> Marik Ishtar was born into a family that guarded the tomb of the Pharoah Atem for generations. As a child, Marik was subjected to a Tomb Keeper initiation ceremony which involved ''carving the hieroglyphs from the pharaoh's tomb onto his back with a hot knife. This birthed a hatred of the pharaoh and a desire to free his family from their servitude to him at any cost as well as created Marik's dark side, Yami Marik.
</li><li> Played with in regards to Mai. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Dark Game</a> that Marik subjects her to in Battle City certainly traumatizes her but it is Dartz's taking advantage of this trauma to prey on her vulnerability and using the power of the Orichalcos to enslave people that causes her to join his cult.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>:
<ul><li> Done to Kaiser Ryo... except we never learn what the villain's motive was for doing it to him! Unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, he was neither a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">Cult</a> leader nor soul stealer and didn't really have anything to gain from corrupting a teenager. Hell Kaiser isn't traditionally "evil", but he did become a much more vicious, ruthless character, as well as using the Underground's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricTorture">Electric Torture</a> devices against other duelists.
<ul><li> He then tries this on his own little brother, and might have succeeded had Judai not intervened.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> Judai later proves that a character with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a> is, in fact, not immune from being driven evil by pain.
</li><li> Ten years of agony at the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">the Light of Destruction</a> drove Yubel completely insane. Specifically, the only way their mind could cope with the torture their beloved Judai had accidentally inflicted upon them was to become convinced that love and pain are actually the same thing. Season 3 is caused by their desire to return the favour on their return.
</li></ul></li><li> Riful in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> really likes trying to do this, although she isn't especially successful.
<ul><li> It works <em>in theory</em> because she's only trying to provoke the Claymore's into releasing their full yoma power and becoming Awakened Ones; it's an almost completely physical event and what they want doesn't factor into it. Although Claymores fear awakening more than anything else, once they awaken they tend to immediately find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood">they enjoy the power and freedom from humanity</a>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifies this trope</a>. Riful just tends to have bad luck; the first Claymore she tried it on died from the torture, the second worked but turned into an Awakened One too weak to be any use so she killed it and the third was rescued before her mind fully awakened.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins">Hansel and Gretel</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em> are a somewhat unique case in that they're children, and were <em>raised</em> under torture and abuse and implied rape as opposed to being decent people who were warped by it. So here it's less "Torture Makes You Evil" and more "Being Surrounded By Pain and Suffering Practicallly Since Birth With No Other State Of Being Known To You Other Than Pain Makes You <em>Fucked Up</em>."
</li><li> Genkaku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em> was revealed to have been beaten and raped by a group of bullies who hung around the temple when he was younger. It was definitely a contributing factor for making him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and evil.
</li><li> Shiro Onijima of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pupa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pupa">Pupa</a></em> (not the anime, of course). As a child he was locked on by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist">Mad Artist</a>, claiming that love was his inspiration and pain was the purest form of love. The torture he endured involved a lot of "anger and pain," a room full of creepy worms, and the artist painting a picture inmediately after stripping him naked and whipping him. Shiro doesn't exactly turn evil, per se, although he starts believing that pain truly is love. And then he became the abusive father that often mutilated his son Utsutsu, because Shiro loved his son and wanted to show him that love.

It all started when a sadistic Investigator went off the rails and brutalized an imprisoned Ghoul until his victim was driven insane. This Ghoul, Yamori, would emerge from his captivity having taken on his tormentor's personality and became infamous for his hobby of capturing and torturing other Ghouls to death. Eventually, he would capture gentle protagonist Kaneki and subject him to over a week of brutal torture.

</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MekkoRarekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MekkoRarekko">Mekko Rarekko</a></em>, we have two examples, although one is much more extreme than the other.
<ul><li> As an elementary student, Amanuma Shinichi felt that he had everything he ever wanted feeling that he was handsome with rich parents and that he was one of, if not the best student in the school. He was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> towards Yamano Taishou, someone who looked up to him greatly for how cool he thought he was.

So it's a subverted case with Taishou.
</li><li> Then we have Amanuma himself which is played completely straight. After middle school, his parents got him into a top middle school in the country, but he didn't think every much of it because he was already such a great student in his elementary school. But when he finally got into the top middle school with other top students, he realized that he wasn't as special as he really thought he was and that there he was just an average student. He tried very hard to catch up with the top students but he was unable to and he hated that. After turning in a student to a teacher for doing something bad he felt that it was the right thing for him to do. However <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the students got back at him by burning the word <em>pig</em> onto his stomach. That experience lead to him dropping out of the top middle school and becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">Hikikomori</a> for a while. As a Hikikomori, he started to believe that everyone had a dark and ugly side they were hiding and that they just never show their true feelings. This lead to him having a much different outlook on life and he does turn evil and when he transfers to Buchi and Taishou's middle school, (in Taishou class, no less)) he pretends to be his friend again only to end up torturing him just like before and even making him into his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a>.</span>

Little wonder that these sorcerers were said to be "secretive".
</li><li> Thanks to some of the beliefs of Shinto and Buddhism, a number of Japanese ghost stories feature elements of this; the difference being that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">not just bodies</a> that can be tortured, as a <em>soul</em>, too, can be driven to downright malicious madness that lasts even after death; often this is caused by the horrific circumstances of the death itself.

There was no corrupting him - he is even nice to Ward, who looks like his father. Then there is Ward, who didn't become one bit evil, even though his father was abusive and at least once almost killed him.

<ul><li> Tolkien was rather ambivalent about this detail; his notes made it clear that he didn't want it to be canon, and it also raises a number of thorny questions about with his mythology. For example, why haven't the number of orcs decreased over time as the originals were killed off? Orcs as corrupted elves also didn't mesh with his cosmology; would dead orcs go to the Halls of Mandos, where normal elves are taken after death, or would they share the fate of Men?

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, Gollum was evil to begin with, but after being tortured by Sauron he became worse.

<ul><li> Questionable. Winston's torture doesn't really turn him evil, per se; he just becomes a 'good citizen'. In fact part of the means used to break his self esteem and conviction is reminding him that as a rebel he promised to do anything, commit any atrocity, in the name of the Brotherhood of Freedom, the possibly non-existent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>. You could maybe argue that obedience is evil, but whether that's true or not is kind of the point of the book ("Is a lunatic a minority of one?"). Either way, the torture and its effects are definitely not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">hand waved</a> but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explored in great detail</a> (about half the book).

It just did.
<ul><li> It was explained as 'Years of horrific torture designed to break someone, and then keep torturing them and only stop if they torture other people for you.'
</li><li> It also probably helps that the people Mord-Sith come from have grown up <em>worshiping</em> and learning blind obedience to the Mord-Sith's master. As terrifying as the prospect is, the girls chosen have already had it hammered into them that this is a holy calling and their destined fate, and are partially picked for a lack of innate resistance and a natural desire to please. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> is far more powerful when you <em>start out</em> seeing your captors as compassionate teachers and ideal role models.
</li><li> They take the sweetest, most eager-to-please girls at a very young age, torture them elaborately and horrifically, physically and psychologically, until they will do anything for their teacher; until they become so used to pain that they actually get off on using the weapon which causes anyone it touches - including the wielder - unendurable pain; then they are forced to watch as their mother is tortured to death, and then to torture their own father to death. Oh, and it's considered commendable if they thereafter avenge themselves on their masters by torturing them to death. Anyone who is pushed that far without dying is bound to go a bit insane.

<ul><li> Inquisitor Glokta, one of the main protagonists, was a dashing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a> and all around "golden boy" until he was captured in battle and horribly tortured, leaving him a total physical wreck.

Somewhat subverted in that he wasn't really a great guy prior to the torture, so in a way, it just brought out the "real him".
<ul><li> Glokta's example is deconstructed as the story goes on; he was raised to be a soldier and nothing else, and when he was crippled, he had no other skills to fall back on... but he <em>did</em> have lengthy experience in knowing how to break a man, making his turn to the Inquisition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">quite sensible.</a> He's also unique in that he becomes more compassionate instead of less through the trilogy, making use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook">Bothering by the Book</a> to spare the innocent as far as he can.

In Crispin's books we find that he used to be a decent man, as good a friend of Han's as Lando was. Then he got captured, tortured, and crippled for life. In the third book we see that the experience has made him quite bitter. When Lando and Han visit him to see if there's anything they can do to help, at first he doesn't acknowledge them.

(Not to be confused with the Loki in Marvel's superhero comics and movies.) His origin is unclear, as he is neither one of the Aesir nor a Vanir, but becomes bloodbrother to Odin and friend of Thor. Loki, the shapeshifting god of the hearthfire, starts out as a trickster who causes mischief but often gets the gods of Asgard out of a tight corner. This changes after he has to flee from the halls of Asgard and hide on Midgard (Middle Earth), although the reasons given vary according to the various tales in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProseEdda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProseEdda">Prose Edda</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda">Poetic Edda</a></em>:
<ul><li> One version claims Loki, the father of the wolf Fenrir, the Midgard Snake, and of Hel, the goddess of the Underworld, was feared for his prophesied role in the coming Final Winter, which is why the gods wanted to imprison him (despite the fact it was also prophesied that he would free himself in time for the final battle).
</li><li> Another tale paints Loki as indirectly responsible for the (prophesied) death-by-mistletoe of Baldur, god of light, and the subsequent unsuccessful attempt to resurrect Baldur from the Underworld, which set in motion the events of <em>Ragnarök</em>, the Norse apocalypse.
</li><li> The ballad "Lokasenna" (Loki's taunting of the gods) from the <em>Poetic Edda</em> however describes how the sea god Aegir aroused Loki's ire by holding a big feast at his hall and inviting everyone in Asgard except Loki; when Loki crashed the party and started angrily taunting the assembled gods and goddesses, Loki not only insulted several of them with sarcastic banter about their various not-so-brave deeds but also bragged how he bedded many of the goddesses while their husbands were away. Enraged, the gods tried to kill Loki, who had to flee. When the gods finally captured him, they transformed one of Loki's sons into a raging wolf who tore the other son apart in front of Loki and Loki's Aesir wife, then used the sons' entrails as chains to bind Loki to a boulder in a cave until he couldn't move, <em>then</em> they hung a poisonous snake over his exposed face that drooled acidic poison into Loki's eyes day and night; after the gods had left Loki's loyal wife spent days and nights holding up a bowl over Loki's face to catch the poison, but whenever she went outside to empty the bowl, the agony of pain made Loki tear madly against his chains (which caused earthquakes). He manage to free himself in time for Ragnarök and joined the tribes of giants, his own monstrous children, and the ship of the dead that came sailing from Helheim in their battle against the gods of Asgard. - Which makes this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">Older Than Print</a>, depending on if you believe Loki was always secretly evil or if his mind snapped during the torture.
</li><li> Loki could be kind to his followers at times, as told in the very few remaining stories about him. So he's not always depicted as evil.

For a Spirit to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Inverse</a>, they must experience absolute despair. Westcott believes in using torture to achieve this. He proposes doing this to Tohka, though it's rendered moot when Shidou is seemingly killed in front of her and she Inverses anyway. When he did this successfully to Nia, she didn't Inverse and simply stopped responding to anything. Westcott therefore decided to apply a block on her memories of being tortured and then released her. As it turns out, Nia had lost faith in humanity prior to being captured and tortured (due to her omniscience letting her see all the ugly parts of humans), but she regains it after being freed. After this happens, Westcott orders the memory block be removed. The sudden return of all of the memories of suffering, combined with her new positive outlook, succeeds in making her Inverse.

He was a little angry at the world in general after that.
<ul><li> It wasn't just being imprisoned by the Gittish Empire; it was also the fact that he had been sold out by the very town that had taken him in, including his lover. Apparently, she wasn't in on the plan to have Corvus arrested, believing she was subduing him with a sleeping potion because she and him were to hide at a nearby lake, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a> would have caused him to ditch the hiding spot. He didn't realize this, and thought she was also betraying him. The betrayal and torture filled Corvus with so much hatred and grief that he eventually came to hate the mortal realm and all its inhabitants; all of Corvus' negative emotions became so strong that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">turned into some sort of demon</a> with the strength to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rend the very heavens asunder with enormous dark energy beams</span> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">use the sickeningly powerful Magic Burst spell in battle</a>.

Then they get force-fed the flesh of their own species. Near the end of the process, the women <em>willingly</em> and <em>eagerly</em> tear apart their former loved ones and devour them with relish. Not long after that they become full fledged Broodmothers.
<ul><li> Although he's not exactly "evil", this is a lot of how Fenris got the way he is. After being put through a ritual that burned Lyrium into his skin, one that was so mentally scarring he's forgotten his entire life up to that point, and his Tevinter Magister master being indescribably petty and cruel, he's turned into a brooding, skulking mess of a man. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">That doesn't stop the ladies from squealing</a> over him... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">Or the menfolk</a>.
</li><li> Anders gets this as well. Even in <em>Awakening</em>, before he was possessed by a corrupted Spirit of Justice and started hanging out next to a literal hellmouth in Kirkwall, one gets the impression that the seven escape attempts from the Circle of Magi weren't just because the guy wanted some fresh air. Supplemental material (codexes and exerpts from <em>The World of Thedas</em> books) confirm they weren't. Anders was actually complacent in the Circle for a while until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until he fell in love with Karl, a fellow mage in the Ferelden Circle, but when the Templars found out they sent Karl away to the Kirkwall Circle to psychologically break Anders. It worked. After Karl got sent away, Anders started his seven plus escape attempts.</span>
</li><li> Cullen got hit with this too. In the first game, he starts off as a nice, personable, romantically shy young man who sympathized with mages. After being imprisoned and tortured for weeks on end by demons summoned by a handful of blood mages, he becomes convinced that <em>all</em> mages are walking abominations waiting to happen and fanatically advocates slaughtering them all. So he got transferred to the literal hellmouth in Kirkwall and became the right-hand to the tyrannical Knight-Commander Meredith. (To the point that if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Hawke</a> comes to him with proof that a fellow Templar has been illegally rendering mages <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Tranquil</a>, Cullen agrees that they <em>should</em> be using the practice more widely.) By the third game he has quit the Templars but remains distrustful of mages, and his past of helping Meredith abuse, torture, put in solitary confinement, cover up sexual abuse, illegally lobotomize, and randomly murder mages over the pettiest offenses for a decade is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwaved">handwaved</a> as just the result of trauma from his torture.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em>, Lab Zero did their best to do this with Painwheel. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In both her and Filia's ending, it doesn't stick.

</li><li> While Nights of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/AJCO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/AJCO">AJCO</a></em> was hardly a saint to begin with, following the psychological torture she suffered during the Silo arc she lost her only redeeming feature - her love for the Castle Crew.
<ul><li> And <em>then</em> when she tried to reclaim power by threatening Breyos, he injected her with deadly spider venom and left her to die. She's now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">completely broken and loyal to AJCO</a>. At least for now.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">The Spoony Experiment</a></em>, Spoony recounts the time his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em> LARP character was captured and tortured into joining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Lancea</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Sanctum</a> and does the horrible things they tell him to. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subversion">For the first session.</a> Pissed off they tried to forcibly take over his character, Spoony decided to fight back, used his massive chemistry score to make a bathtub full of Semtex, sneaked it into the Vampire Prince's sanctum without anyone noticing, then went to his car and used the detonator. If not for GM fiat, Spoony would have leveled the building and took with it the head of the oppressive vampire hierarchy. (Just for reference, this is a LARP, there was no actual Semtex or detonators, just index cards that say that).
