Everyone's caught in a life-or-death situation. One of the characters hedges their bets, steps forward so the others survive, and ends up on the "death" side of the equation. Pathos is obtained, tears are shed, etc., etc.
</p><p>Except... well, did he/she really need to do that? Couldn't he have gotten out of the way of the death trap once it was smashed and about to explode? Couldn't she have just held out for a few seconds longer until help arrived? Couldn't he have just talked them all out of that? What can we say, it's pathos — logic must be left by the wayside. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper">The Plot Reaper</a> has spoken.
</p><p>A Stupid Sacrifice is what happens when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> has a head-on collision with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>. It is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Senseless Sacrifice</a>, where someone offers themselves up as a sacrifice only for outside factors to make it useless; this is when a sacrifice occurs when anyone in command of all their logical faculties could've seen that it didn't have to end that way. Surprisingly little overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause">Martyr Without a Cause</a>, but sometimes the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> may make them — and lament them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness">Dirty Business</a> — because they can't be bothered to notice that they were unnecessary.

Note that this doesn't apply when the character could have lived, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">but quite clearly didn't want to</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GodMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GodMars">God Mars</a></em> has the infamous example of Prince Marg, who dies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">in attempt to protect his younger brother</a> by blocking an oncoming beam blast from an enemy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">super robot</a> using <em>his own physical body</em>. What's worse? That brother of his was sitting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">super robot</a> to begin with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed">Appleseed</a></em>, Kudoh manages to overturn a bad situation by kicking a villain's weapon and threatening the others with his own. The good guys grab their guns as well, point it at the baddies and quickly run out of the room. But Kudoh, for some reason, doesn't follow them. He stays there pointing his gun at the baddies, who outnumber him ten to one, and is shot to death as soon as the others are gone.
<ul><li> Tereus in <em>Appleseed Ex Machina</em> tries to have one, but gets kicked out of it by other protagonists.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GANTZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GANTZ">GANTZ</a></em>. An alien throws a highly corrosive acid at Katou. Instead of, say, pushing him out of the way, Kishimoto runs <em>around</em> him, blocks him with her body, and takes the blast.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifices</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">rarely work</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>.
<ul><li> The truly pointless sacrifice in the series, however, has got to be Piccolo's in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, in which he decides to die so that the Black Star Dragon Balls wouldn't be used ever again. This is ignoring the fact that the Black Star Dragon Balls are completely scattered across the universe making any attempts to collect it without any knowledge of it even existing virtually impossible. There's also no reason given why they couldn't just destroy the Black Star Dragon Balls if they felt they were too dangerous to exist.
</li><li> Piccolo does this a second time in the Super 17 arc, where he dooms himself to an eternity in hell in order to help Goku escape from it. It's a sad moment until you realize that A: both Goku and Pikkon were able to freely travel the afterlife including hell with no repercussions. King Yamma even let out Vegeta from hell in order to help defeat Majin Buu. So the fact that he wouldn't make an exception for Piccolo is not only out of character but makes no sense, and Goku should have been able to escape simply by turning Super Saiyan 4 and using Instant Transmission without Piccolo needing to go down there and sacrifice himself at all. What make this worse is that Goku uses Instant Transmission to visit Piccolo while he's in hell at the end of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, when Cell self-destructs, Goku teleports him away to King Kai's planet and dies when Cell blows up, despite the fact that he could have just teleported back to Earth before that happened, preferably with King Kai and his two companions. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note022lo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note022lo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note022lo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In the manga Goku has no time to do this, as it cuts to Cell blowing up on King Kai's planet immediately with no time for anyone to react. </span> It is implied that Goku probably allowed this to happen as he states he wants to stay dead so people that come after him won't target the Earth. But out of all the villains that attacked Earth at this point (Piccolo, his son, Saiyans, Frieza and his father, Gero's androids, Cell) only Frieza and Gero were seeking revenge on him, and both were dead; both of them also wanted to conquer Earth anyway, and everyone else was stopped because of him, so if anything Earth was <em>less</em> safe without him. He did also want to make Earth and the Z-Fighters stop relying on him to save the day and bring up someone new to take the mantle. It was Toriyama's intention to retire Goku at this point and have Gohan take over as lead. However, that didn't play well with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">his editors</a> or fans so he was forced to bring Goku back (again).
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>. Yusuke tries to prevent Kurama from sacrificing his life to save his mother's life, saying it doesn't make logical sense because Kurama's mother would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">condemned to a life of grief</a>. So in turn, Yusuke offers up his life instead. Eventually they both live and the wish is granted anyway, but only then does the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> kick in for Yusuke: if he'd done that, his <em>own</em> mother would've been condemned to a life of grief. During the earlier parts of the story, his mother was an alcoholic with no job and acted pretty indifferent toward him. However, by this point he should know better after the grief she went through when she thought he had died at the beginning of the series. He prevents this (in some translations and adaptations) by suggesting that the mirror take <strong>part</strong> of his life, so Kurama won't have to die and his mother will be saved. Then again, the act is reckless enough to impress the Forlorn Hope into not taking either of their lives.
</li></ul><ul><li> In the 2003 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Scar jumps in front of Lust to protect her from a hail of bullets. She's a homunculus who can't be killed that easily, and Scar <em>knows this</em>, but he takes the bullets anyway. And there's an emotional element as well: the body Lust was made from was the woman Scar's brother loved - and Scar as well, as he later confesses.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, four Alabasta warriors in the Kicking Claw Squad drink a potion known as the "Fatal Fuel", which apparently increases their physical strength but kills them in minutes. Unfortunately, Crocodile can turn into sand and avoid their attacks, an ability he seems to have displayed in front of many people on at least one occasion that they should have known about. This is made all the more tragic\hilarious when Crocodile decides to just fly off to an out of reach ledge and watch them die instead of letting them even <em>attempt</em> to futilely try to kill him. Crocodile has also flown in front of the villagers countless times before, so clearly this wasn't a well thought out plan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> is almost one very long string of these. Probably the most egregious example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Rei</a>, who after spouting some nonsense about his debt to Kenshiro, decides to attack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Raoh</a> despite <em>knowing that he cannot possibly win</em>, since he had seen the Death Omen Star and Raoh had not, and despite the fact that Raoh wasn't <em>doing</em> anything other than hanging out and waiting for Kenshiro to show up. Raoh for his part even tries to warn him off until he realizes that Rei's Death Omen Star meant that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">Raoh was probably meant to kill him</a>. Ironically Raoh actually ends up <em>saving</em> Rei's life in a way, by interrupting his kamikaze final attack with a strike that will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">slowly kill him over the course of three days</a>. It does end up killing Rei eventually but he gets a lot more time to actually accomplish some things than if he had been allowed to go through with his plan to ineffectually blow himself up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin">Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin</a></em> <em>loves</em> this trope. No one is happy unless they're about to die. There are at least three separate occasions of a character killing themselves (or trying to) in order to kill an enemy, without even trying to survive. If you have a spike pit, you can just toss the other guy in, fellas. No need to jump in with him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueDrop">Blue Drop</a></em> does this at the ending. It conveniently takes away any means of plot exposition and therefore ironically covers up a severe lack of justification for the situation in general. Creates a downer ending, except for Hagino who is, along with her entire race a firm believer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Warrior Heaven</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> does this on occasion:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> has Cagalli's father and leader of Orb, Lord Uzumi Atha, sacrifice himself in order to destroy Orb's mass driver before the invading Earth Alliance can occupy it, thus denying them the ability to send their large military force into space. Except... there's no reason why they couldn't have set the demolition charges off <em>remotely</em>, and even if there was, there's no reason why it had to be <em>Uzumi</em> who sacrificed himself to set them off. Have some random mook volunteer — or hell, someone mortally wounded in the fighting up to that point — do it instead, an Uzumi doesn't have to abandon his country, his people, and his <em>daughter</em> exactly when they need him most. Except he does, and his decision is treated as incredibly noble and proof of Uzumi's dedication to Orb.
<ul><li> This has bitten him in the ass after his death, as the power vacuum left behind by the entire Atha cabinet committing suicide was filled by the Alliance-friendly Seiran family, which kicked off much of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny">Destiny's</a> plot to Orb's misery.

However, Cagalli followed him in even though he'd told her to leave him and takes him to safety in her own mobile suit, allowing Justice Gundam to self destruct and take out GENESIS without Athrun having to go along with it.

He is very much aware he is stupid and selfish and should NOT do what he does but does it anyways, quite ready to die in the process. In season 2 Patrick pulls a rather heroic one throwing himself in front of a suicide MS instead of shooting at it. But being the Immortal Colasour he probably knew he was going to make it.
</li></ul></li><li> A non-fatal example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em> where Tabitha's mother realised that the glass of wine that had been handed to her daughter was poisoned with a poison that would make her insane, so she snatched it out of Tabitha's hands in the nick of time — and <em>drank it!</em>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Minato, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal half of Kurama inside his newborn son, Naruto. But had he resealed all of Kurama within Kushina and allowed both of them to die after she got impaled by his claws, it would've temporarily put a hold on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plans for the years it would take Kurama to regenerate a new body. This is the result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>; originally, Kurama had been on an unstoppable rampage and sealing him within Naruto was the only way he could be stopped, Kushina being his former host and recontaining it within her to stop his rampage was made up much, MUCH later in the story. Allegedly, Jinchūriki were used as war deterrents, but when he was revived through Edo Tensei, Minato proved that in the right circumstances, he is the equal of not only Kurama, but also the next strongest Tailed Beast, Gyūki the Eight-Tails, and the Fourth Raikage as well. Add onto that Hiruzen, the Third Hokage (strongest of his generation, maybe of any generation) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">the Sannin</a> and you've got a group that are far more effective and convenient for deterring attacks than an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>. End result, his son grew up an orphan, utterly despised by nearly everyone in the village for no reason and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Obito's</span> plan has gone off more or less without a hitch to date. Its power does become useful against the bad guys.
<ul><li> Probably averted, however, when you consider that his other stated reason for sealing Kurama inside Naruto was to give his son the means to fight the masked villain that caused this mess. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Which was exactly what happened.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Jiraiya had an opportunity to escape from Pain, but went back to fight in the face of certain death in order to uncover the villain's true identity. But the problem is, <em>Jiraiya had basically already figured it out</em>, all he did by going back and dying was verify what he had already suspected. If he wanted to verify his suspicion, he could've just gone back to Konoha and let Inoichi read his mind, which would've allowed the two of them to review his memories of the fight in slow-motion. And since he died shortly after doing so, Jiraiya wasn't able to explain it to anybody else, instead writing a coded message on the back of one of his toad summons...which for some reason used a code that Jiraiya had never taught to anybody else, thus requiring his allies to break the code and which even after decoding was such a cryptic message as to be of little use. And to make matters worse, when Pain launched his attack on Konoha, <em>Naruto figured out the same thing that Jiraiya had all by himself, without even knowing about the message from Jiraiya.</em>
</li><li> Rin Nohara. When the Kiri-Nin capture her and seal Isubo the Three-Tails in her body, she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets Kakashi to kill her</span> so that she can't be used as a weapon against Konoha. However, this could have easily been avoided if she had helped Kakashi fight her captors, since he was willing to fight for her safety anyway - this would have stalled time long enough for Obito to arrive and help the two fight the Mist ninja (though in fairness, they couldn't have known Obito was even <em>alive</em> at this point, much less coming to help them). Also, the whole problem they face is that Isubo's seal was made deliberately unstable so that it would explode once Rin got back to Konoha. What Kakashi and Rin seemed to forget is that their sensei, Minato, was <em>one of the world's foremost seal masters</em> and <em>would've been capable of teleporting to their location</em> as soon as he was aware of their situation. And Kakashi can summon talking dogs who could run back to Konoha and notify the Fourth even while they're still fighting the Mist ninja. So they could've just killed the Mist ninja, then wait for Minato to fix the seal and turn Rin into just a normal jinchūriki, significantly increasing Konoha's military power in the process by gaining control of a tailed beast that used to belong to Kiri. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Obito doesn't take her death very well and puts together a revenge scheme that sets Black Zetsu's plot to revive Kaguya into motion.</span> Therefore, Rin's sacrifice is the cause of every bad thing that has happened in the Naruto universe over the next three decades.
</li><li> In all fairness, Rin's kidnapping was planned to coincide with Minato being absent from the Village. It was even mentioned that he was still absent <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during the events of the rescue, chase, and eventual sacrifice</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X/1999</a></em> presents quite a few: the heroes, the Dragons of Heaven, protect a set of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Cosmic Keystones</a> located around the city of Tokyo, and the goal of the Dragons of Earth is to destroy the keystones and wipe out humanity. The Dragons of Heaven, nearly to a man, sacrifice themselves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">kill the Dragons of Earth</a>... unfortunately, the death of a Dragon of Heaven results in the catastrophic collapse of the keystone they protected, meaning that the heroes end mostly doing the villains' work <em>for</em> them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted and lampshaded: Gray tries to use a spell that would turn his entire body into ice to freeze an opponent, said ice being unable to melt under ordinary circumstances. However, Natsu punches him and talks him out of it, after which he realizes that said opponent knows of a method to thaw the nigh unmeltable ice.
</li><li> Very much played straight later: Gray acts on instinct and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">takes some dragon lasers</a> that were meant to hit Juvia, but since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalShapeshifter">Juvia's body is made of water</a>, they would just have passed through her without letting her take any damage if he hadn't interfered. The worst thing about that is that Gray is actually <em>killed</em> by the lasers. It doesn't last long as the time is turned back, Gray has a vision of his own death, manages to avoid the lasers and survives (at least in a new timeline), but still...
</li><li> Played straight with August during the war with Alvarez: having completely out-matched and out-gunned <em>Gildarts</em> of all people thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">powerful</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">magic</a>, instead of using literally <em>any other attack</em>, August decides to end the war right then and there with a suicide attack meant to wipe out all of Fairy Tail at once that only succeeds in killing himself (due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas">a very convenient</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>).
</li><li> Earlier in the Alvarez war was Makarov, who uses Fairy Law on the legions of berserk enemy soldiers overwhelming his guild despite knowing that the technique will kill him when used on too many enemies at once. What brings it into this trope is that Mavis claims to have a plan to get them all out of the situation, but Makarov is simply too impatient to listen and tells her quite plainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterNeedThanMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterNeedThanMine">he would gladly sacrifice what's left of his own already-old life to ensure a certain victory</a>. Even <em>then</em>, however, he was only able to wipe out 70-80% of Alvarez's army (not an insignificant number, admittedly, given they numbered in the hundreds of thousands) along with dispelling said enchantment on the rest while leaving the remaining heavy hitter of the Spriggan 12 alone with his remaining lifespan.
</li></ul></li><li> Pointed out and possibly lampshaded in the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SteelAngelKurumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SteelAngelKurumi">Steel Angel Kurumi</a></em>.

Nakahito notes that Kurumi can still be saved, but they can't stop the process or the angels who gave up their force would have been for nothing. The cannon is fired in a painful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterruptedCooldownHug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterruptedCooldownHug">Interrupted Cooldown Hug</a> moment, killing both Kurumi and Nakahito... until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss">True Love's Kiss</a> revives them <em>and</em> the Angels, leading Karinka to mutter "You mean I cried for nothing?"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, Soul takes a hit for Maka a couple of times. Stein even compliments him for the instinct at one point. This wouldn't be so stupid except that Soul can turn part of his body into a nigh-invulnerable metal scythe at will. He is the last person in the universe who should be using his mortal flesh as a shield (though granted, when he did so against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Crona</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VibroWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VibroWeapon">Ragnarok</a> had already shown to be capable of hurting him even in scythe form; turning human was the only way to intercept the entire attack without it hitting Maka). Later Death-Sama manages to top this, by taking a near-lethal attack to the chest in order to save the school staff. While holding a scythe in his hand. A scythe which he has already used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">block that same attack</a> several times.

Notably, when Oz is being held prisoner by the Baskervilles at Lutwidge, he tells Elliot and Leo to leave him and save themselves, which triggers Elliot's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> and causes him to later (after rescuing Oz) verbally deconstruct the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> trope to show the realistic consequences of attempting one.
</li><li> A possible in-universe example can be found in Edgar, the servant character from the book series <em>Holy Knight</em>, who dies to protect his master and the people he loves. We don't learn the context of his sacrifice, but Elliot makes his opinion on the incident quite clear.

It even had an eye laser automatically/reflexively activated whenever he looked at a threat before, but not this time. Apparently a missile is not a threat, but a child's toy gun is...

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em>, was there really not enough room on that board for both Jack and Rose? According to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVgkvaDHmto">an episode<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em>, they in fact could have shared the flotation device with enough of their bodies out of the water for them to both survive  <em>if</em> they had thought to tie Rose's lifejacket underneath it (this does however assume that two scared, exhausted and freezing people would be thinking rationally enough to think creatively). Let's hope the thought never occurred to Rose in her many subsequent years... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron">James Cameron</a> himself basically summed up the trope once the result was announced in that episode: for the story to work, Jack <em>needed</em> to die; the circumstances were just poorly chosen on his (Cameron's) part.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis">Star Trek: Nemesis</a></em>, was Data's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> even necessary? Did he have to fire the phaser himself, instead of setting the phaser to overload and beaming out? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAgedWithTheActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAgedWithTheActor">Brent Spiner felt that he could no longer convincingly play an ageless character</a> and demanded that Data "die". Curiously, they still introduced an identical twin, who is left alive. And gets all of Data's memories. To add an extra layer of stupidity, this was the last TNG film and so the problem of Spiner being too old to play Data any more was not exactly germane. The series actually <em>did</em> address the issue of Data being ageless, while Spiner obviously wasn't. Data once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> it by saying he developed a means to appear as if he was aging (making it part of his quest to understand humanity). May not have been airtight, but most fans were likely not to nitpick this particular issue, all things considered.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/Nemesis/Pictorial-4.html">Awesomely skewered here:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</div></li><li> As revealed in <a class="urllink" href="http://trekmovie.com/2010/10/06/patrick-stewart-on-the-fifth-star-trek-tng-movie-video-images-from-a-life-in-the-theatre/">this interview,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a fifth TNG movie was still on the table while <em>Nemesis</em> was being made, so Spiner writing himself out isn't quite as senseless as it seems in retrospect. Still, he could have been sent away from the Enterprise, perhaps to focus on scientific research. Arguably better than contriving a reason he just <em>has</em> to do this in a way that will get him killed. The alternative method? "Hey, everybody, it's been fun, but I'm transferring to do my own thing. See ya!" Done.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3">Spider-Man 3</a></em> Harry jumps in front of the glider Venom is about to use to kill Peter, but given that he died facing Peter, he must have either spun in midair as he jumped, or ran past him between Venom and Peter to get impaled. Couldn't he have tried to <em>grab</em> the glider? Or just given Venom a shove? This is particularly bad when Peter breaks out of Venom's restraints a few seconds later, so if he'd tried fighting Venom instead of sacrificing himself he'd have had Peter helping him too.

Except that there's no particular reason why she couldn't have done the same thing <em>from the plane</em>, saving both them <em>and</em> herself. For that matter, "the others" in question include Storm and Iceman, either of whom would have stood a chance of holding back the water with their own powers, and Nightcrawler, who could have teleported her aboard the plane as soon as it rose above the water level, and she <em>actively prevented them</em> from helping her.

Phoenix's inaction was at least explained in a deleted scene where she simply refused to help. The rest not so much.
</li></ul></li><li> The same thing as the KGBeast example above happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">Hannibal</a></em>. Hannibal Lecter, supergenius, who once got out of restraints using <em>part of a ballpoint pen</em>, cuts off his own hand to escape from <em>normal handcuffs</em>. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> put it, "I'm disappointed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">he didn't take it with as a snack</a>." Some people theorize he <em>did</em> cut the handcuffs and was wearing the cast to conceal it on the plane. He probably got it through the metal detector using the rest of the pen. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD">MAD</a></em> magazine even pointed out in their parody (through Clarice's dialogue) that he could have cut through the handcuffs with the cleaver.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></em>: Although Harry realizes that he has little to no chances against the thief, be it Voldemort or Snape, he doesn't consider simply sending an owl to the absent Dumbledore until well into the "obstacle course". Neither does he heed McGonagall's assurances that the Stone was perfectly safe, which, big shock, it actually was. In fact, Harry's presence was the only thing that almost allowed Voldemort to get it. This can be <em>narratively</em> justified by the fact that he was an 11-year old boy, even if it was stupid for the character.
</li><li> The 2007-version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmLegend">I Am Legend</a></em> has a particularly bad example of this, when the main character spontaneously decides to blow himself and all the vampires up while a perfectly fine escape route was available. Some times you can rewrite the script's ending at last minute without any ill effects. Other times, not so much.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboyIITheGoldenArmy">Hellboy II: The Golden Army</a></em>, the elven princess stabs herself in the heart to kill her linked villain-brother as he rises to kill Hellboy behind his back. However, if she saw it happening, why didn't she simply shout and saved Abe from heartache? Or, if shouting is too risky, just <em>stab her own hand</em> and get him to drop the dagger??? Part of her reasoning could've been that she knew her brother would never stop trying to take control of the Golden Army, no matter the cost, and the only way to prevent another potential murder spree and guarantee the world's safety was to kill him. Unfortunately, this runs afoul of another issue: namely that she was willing to sacrifice herself to stop her brother at the beginning of the movie and then doesn't kill herself (or do much of anything else) once he murders their father and starts massacring people in a bizzare inversion of this trope.
</li><li> A mild and non-lethal case happens to Kevin's mom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone">Home Alone</a></em>. She goes to a lot of trouble and extra expenses to get home to her abandoned son as soon as possible, but only gains a few minutes ahead of the rest of the family who arrive by plane she refused to wait for. Not to mention that Kevin was perfectly fine, and there was no need to hurry at all. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a>, because reason doesn't apply to mothers when it comes to care for their children.

In the book, it's better explained that she did it to keep Bond safe. Never mind that he's a spy who's constantly in danger from foes anyway. It's also rather confusing as to how her death helps him at all. And why she couldn't have at least given him some more information about her blackmailers before she died. Partly justified in how she obviously felt guilty, which motivated her to commit this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepBlueSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepBlueSea">Deep Blue Sea</a></em>, Susan needs to distract the last of the sharks and keep it from escaping the pen, so she steps over to the edge of the water, cuts her hand to draw the shark in with her blood - then jumps in the water for no apparent reason, and too far from the ladder to get back up it (specifically, the lowest rung breaks when she tries to get out). This is likely a result of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FocusGroupEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FocusGroupEnding">Focus Group Ending</a>, as test audiences wanted to see her killed as karmic punishment for her unethical genetic experiment getting the others killed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilExtinction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilExtinction">Resident Evil: Extinction</a></em>: when the convoy is attacked by mutated crows the crowd tries to get away from the broken-down vehicles and into the working ones to escape. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Betty</span> gets everybody out of her vehicle and has a good several seconds to follow them; instead she closes the door on the back sealing herself in the vehicle, ineffectually shoots a couple of crows as they break the windshield, and is pecked to death in short order. The only remotely plausible reason is that she wanted to stop the crows flying through the vehicle and at the survivors, but: the crows are <em>flying</em>, everybody is in the open air so the birds don't <em>need</em> to get through the vehicle, and even then she could just have gotten out and closed the door from the outside.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel">Man of Steel</a></em> has a tornado appear in the middle of a busy interstate so the Kent family evacuates the car, but Pa Kent sees a dog still stuck in the car and <em>goes to get the dog.</em> Of course, the tornado bears down on him and Clark moves to save him, but Pa Kent just holds out his hand and for some reason, Clark obeys. The stupidity is outrageous for the following reasons: (1) Pa Kent is at a pretty big distance, so the likelihood that anyone could see Clark save him over through the debris is minimal (2) there have actually been cases that animals survive being thrown by tornadoes because they are small, light, and don't tense up the way that people do in high stress situations, so Pa Kent sacrificed himself for an animal that may not have even died in the first place. (3) At that point, Clark saving the bus full of children had been known by some people in the town, so if he did use super-speed to save his father, it probably wouldn't have even been that big of a deal. (4) Clark later mentions to Lois that if he was exposed to the public, he could just go into hiding as he's done it before, so if someone DID happen to see him using his powers to save his father, he could just leave. There really is no excuse for this scene other than they wanted Clark feel guilty about arguing with his father before he died.
</li><li> A non-fatal example can be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em>. Just before the climax of the film, the Smurfs have visited a bookstore and have found the key to getting them out of New York City and back to the Smurf Village. They get ambushed by Gargamel, however, necessitating an escape via an air passage. As they start climbing in, though, Papa Smurf decides to hold Gargamel off while the other Smurfs run to safety. There are some things wrong with this. For one thing, even though Gargamel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">is a lot more of a threat here</a>, he still couldn't fit in the air vent even with the weapon he has made with Smurf essence. Papa could have easily escaped with the other Smurfs without any problems. Secondly, Papa has no way to defend himself or to counteract Gargamel's magic weapon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">thus he quite easily gets captured by Gargamel</a>. Had Papa simply escaped with everyone else, (which he very easily could have) the climax wouldn't have happened and the Smurfs would have happily returned home without Gargamel getting his hands on any more Smurfs or Smurf essence.

When the hounds find their scent, Landerson sees that his fall had torn off his bandage, and tells Gaunt that it's his blood, and he will try to draw them off.

</li><li> Likewise invoked in <em>Guns Of Tanith</em>. After being shot down while inserting the Larisel teams, Jagdea has to be rescued by the same teams from a Blood Pact patrol looking for downed pilots. She volunteers to stay behind and let the next patrol capture her (after a suitable fight). Mkvenner and Domor shoot this plan down on the grounds that a) the bad guys are very good at torture and b) the only way to make it vaguely plausible that Jagdea'd killed the patrol would be to leave the kind of weapons that would cause those wounds, and a 'downed pilot' toting a sniper rifle and the signature combat knife of a different regiment just raises more questions. Not to mention that they'd need those weapons themselves.

Does he simply throw it in? No, because he's telepathic and is picking up confusing thoughts/feelings from onlookers who think the weapon should be kept just in case (it's literally the only weapon on the planet). So he slips and falls in, the urn still in his hands, literally dying for the sins of his people. Obviously meant as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, it came off as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EsotericHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EsotericHappyEnding">Esoteric Happy Ending</a> at best — the kind that Snyder has all but trademarked in the endings of her novels.

In fact, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cold_Equations#Reactions">author Don Saker wrote a solution story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which incidentally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">swapped the genders of the protagonists</a>. It was published in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Analog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Analog">Analog</a></em> science fiction magazine over thirty years after the original story ran in that publication. It turned out that <em>Analog</em> editor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWCampbell">John W. Campbell</a> had insisted the story end with the death of the girl and had sent the story back three times because the author kept finding ways to save her.
</li><li> In Alma Alexander's <em>The Secrets of Jin-shei</em>, Nhia knows someone is trying to poison the Empress, and so when a servant appears with a goblet of wine, she's suspicious. Her solution? Taste it to find out. It never occurs to her to simply pour out the wine rather than drinking it herself to protect her friend. Given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> ending, it's clear the author just needed to get rid of her.
</li><li> A big part of the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReturnFromTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReturnFromTheStars">Return from the Stars</a></em>. The protagonist, along with his colleagues, has dedicated years of his life (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDilation">and 127 years of Earth time</a>) and risked his life for a deep-space research mission, which he considers to have been a worthy achievement. In contrast, the Earthlings in the meanwhile have decided that sending people on such missions is a staggeringly useless waste of human life and resources, and that space exploration in general was but one of the many blind alleys in human history. (Though it's mostly due to the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">obligatory anti-aggression treatment</a> and the permanent safety and convenience offered by future technology also renders everyone in the future incapable of taking risks, or even comprehending the idea of heroism.) This does not make the protagonist happy.
</li><li> Polish Romanticism used to love this trope, but one of the most annoying examples comes from late XIX century novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SienkiewiczTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SienkiewiczTrilogy">Pan Wołodyjowski</a></em>, where the protagonist blows himself up, so as not to let the enemy into the stronghold he defends. He does so after the stronghold has been given up by the Polish king as one of the armistice's conditions. The author expects full sympathy and admiration for this step on the part of readers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> can be claimed here, though - the protagonist and his friend (who blows himself up alongside him) consider this armistice to really be a defeat.
</li><li> Russian literature tends to do this, too. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IvanYefremov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IvanYefremov">Ivan Yefremov</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfOx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfOx">Hour Of Ox</a></em> the head chief of an astronaut expedition kills herself to avoid torture, despite the fact that she was tough enough to bear the hardest torment, and her comrades would've been able to rescue her in practically no time at all. Blast, they were strong enough to demolish all that planet!
</li><li> In one sci-fi novel, the crew of a relativistic starship needs lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter">Anti Matter</a> to power the relativistic drive. They travel to a planet made out of anti-matter that just happens to pass through the Solar System. Half of them go down in a lander specially equipped with a shield designed to keep anti-matter from interacting with matter for about 10 minutes. They use the lander to grab a large chunk of rock and are on their way back to the ship, when they're surrounded by locals, primitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a>. They assume the lander to be some sort of god, surround it, and start praying to it. With the timer running out on the shield, the lander crew decides to let it run out rather than drive over the natives. Once the shield fails, the lander explodes, killing every native in the vicinity and nearly destroying the starship. <em>Then</em> one of the remaining crewmembers on the ship figures out an even easier way to get the fuel: grab a small asteroid that orbits the planet. So the sacrifice was senseless for two whole reasons.
</li><li> In Nikolai Gudanets's <em>Supreme Commander</em> (which is loosely based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense">X-COM</a></em>), the final mission of the international task force involves the raid of the aliens' base on Earth. A four-man squad enters the central area, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is swimming in his pool (he's a squid). Using his immense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, he takes control over one of the soldiers, who primes and drops a grenade. Another team member (and a possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> of the protagonist) decides that the best course of action is to fall on top of the grenade instead of kicking it into the pool with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. The water would contain most of the blast, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> wouldn't have used the distraction to escape. Although, he does get immediately eaten by a shark.
</li><li> To destroy the last of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFatalToAdults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFatalToAdults">Only Fatal to Adults</a> virus and to kill the man who released it for the first time, Cory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFireUsTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFireUsTrilogy">The Fire-Us Trilogy</a></em> locks them both in a room, releases the virus, and then shoots herself so she won't have to suffer the horrible virus death. Very brave, Cory, but Teacher doesn't menstruate yet, and could have released it without dying.
</li><li> Jesus Christs sacrifice is retconned into this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost">Paradise Lost</a></em>, once one stops to think about the situation. Specifically, the Father and the Son are surveying the newly created Earth when the Father sees Satan flying toward it, headed straight for Eden. He tells the Son and the heavenly host of faithful angels that, if Satan is allowed to reach Adam and Eve, he will convince them to sin, causing them to lose all ability to have a relationship with God, and on top of that will die and wind up in Hell just like Satan, except they cant leave. Knowing this, what do they do? Just stand there, making no attempt to stop Satan from <em>breaking out of his prison</em>, (let alone trying to tempt Man), or do anything to keep him out of Eden. They do send an angel to warn the humans about him, but still let him in unimpeded. The Father gives a speech about how the only way to undo Satans effects is for a sinless being to willfully suffer a horribly agonizing death, and acts like that is their only recourse even though <em>original sin hasnt happened yet</em>, and He could poof Satan back to Hell with a snap of His fingers without Adam and Eve ever knowing about it and without their free will ever being compromised. It is implied that Satan will never stop trying and Adam and Eve will eventually use their free will to sin anyway, but thats still no excuse for letting Satan march right into Eden. At least Jesus gets to come back to life in the end.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has had a few.
<ul><li> One from the Classic series concerns Sara Kingdom. The Daleks have built a weapon called the Time Destructor which fast-forwards time in its proximity, and the Doctor asked Steven and Sara to remain in the TARDIS while he exited to deal with it, his alien physiology allowing him to endure its effects. Sara decides to secretly follow him out, and ages to death in the process. Her death does spur Steven to leave the TARDIS, catch up to the Doctor and put the Time Disrupter in reverse, but he likely would have done that the second he saw the Doctor collapse from its effects.
</li><li> Some have pointed out that all except one death in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E1TheTombOfTheCybermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E1TheTombOfTheCybermen">"The Tomb of the Cyberman"</a> are stupid as until the Doctor gives Kleig the means to revive the Cybermen, the Cybermen can't do anything. This particularly concerns Toberman who sacrifices himself to seal up the Tomb, but he would not have needed to do that in the first place had the Doctor not been "helping Kleig to see what he was up to". This could be forgivable if it was intentional, but it's clear no-one writing the story saw it this way.
</li><li> One of the Thals in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E4PlanetOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E4PlanetOfTheDaleks">Planet of the Daleks</a>" sacrifices his life in an attempt to slow the Daleks down. It takes the Daleks a whole five seconds to exterminate him, and a further ten to search his body, with the time they spend doing so not making any real difference to the rest of the group's escape. In fact, this ends up being a sacrifice that not only proves pointless, but actively detrimental, as the Daleks find the location of the Thals' explosive charges on his body, which would have doomed their entire mission to failure if Jo hadn't stumbled across them in time to retrieve them.
</li><li> Astrid Peth's ridiculous self-sacrifice in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CSVoyageOfTheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2007CSVoyageOfTheDamned">Voyage of the Damned</a>": she uses a forklift to shove the villain off a cliff, and then just keeps going. Granted, it was chiefly a plot device to make sure the Doctor was left alone again (also because Astrid had been Stunt Casted with pop star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue">Kylie Minogue</a>, and there was no way she could fit the show into her schedule,) and the writers do establish the brake line had been cut, but that forklift moved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">so painfully slowly</a> she had plenty of time to throw herself off. Foon's is even less necessary, but at least there you can make a case that she didn't want to live without her husband. Still, given Bannakaffalatta's (legitimate) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">began to pile up in that episode</a>.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E10Midnight">Midnight</a>". The hostess opens the airlock and then... just stands there for a few seconds with the creature before both being sucked out, rather than, you know, pushing the thing and getting the hell away (she likely assumed that it would have done the same while the secondary door was opening and was making sure to take it with her).
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E6TheAlmostPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E6TheAlmostPeople">The Almost People</a>". The sonic screwdriver can apparently splat gangers without affecting normal people. So do we get normal people to kill the ganger monster? No, we have gangers do it and kill themselves in the process.
</li><li> Averted in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E9Flatline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E9Flatline">Flatline</a>". One character gets ready to sacrifice himself by ramming a train against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>, but Clara manages to reach him and point out no-one actually needs to be <em>driving</em> the train, since her hairband can take care of the dead man's switch, and they jump off before it hits.
</li><li> This trope is almost referenced by name by Mayor Me in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E10FaceTheRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E10FaceTheRaven">Face the Raven</a>" when it's discovered that Clara has needlessly taken on a death sentence that was never supposed to be imposed (it was simply a trick), yet now Clara has taken it on, it must be completed, leading to the Doctor's companion being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with Topher's sacrifice in the series finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>. It is quite obvious that Topher could simply set a timer on the pulse-bomb. It is just as obvious that he wants this to be his final act.
</li><li> Pollux's death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash1990">The Flash (1990)</a></em>. Created as Barry's clone with all his powers but none of the maturity, the blue-clad speedster accidentally kills his creator and then wounds the experiment's financier in self-defense (the guy shot at him, Pollux caught the bullet and then threw it back). He then starts a super-speed fight with Barry. The financier then attempts to shoot Barry, who's still dazed from being beaten by Pollux. Pollux jumps in front of the bullet instead of, say, catching it again or moving Barry out of the way.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Graceland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Graceland">Graceland</a></em> Charlie and Briggs are undercover FBI agents trying to set up a drug deal. The drug dealer becomes suspicious and insists that one of them inject him/herself with heroin to prove that they are not cops. Charlie grabs the syringe and inject herself. She has a bad reaction to the drug and Briggs has to get her out of there. The operation was blown anyway and her action was not only extremely dangerous but resulted in her partners lying on official reports so she would not lose her job over it. It is a clear sign that Charlie has worked too long undercover and was suffering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> due to just finding the dead body of her informant who ODed.
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighlanderTheRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighlanderTheRaven">Highlander The Raven</a></em> climaxes with police officer Claudia Hoffman diving in front of a bullet to protect Amanda, who is immortal and would easily recover from being shot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> Charlie's death in the third season finale has elements of this. If he could swim down into the Looking Glass station, why couldn't he swim back up? There is no reason he couldn't have simply closed the door from the outside. Or just used the scuba gear to escape before the (rather large) looking glass was filled with water.
</li><li> On the other hand, Sayid's sacrifice was utterly stupid, since he could have just as well taken the bomb immediately instead of waiting for his turn to speak to Jack, and close a door behind it. He could have made time.
</li><li> In contrast to Charlie, Jin's drowning was utterly pointless. He could have got away, but chose to stay with Sun and drown just so they could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">Together in Death</a>, despite the fact that this meant <em>orphaning his daughter whom he had never met</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em>: A rare example where the <em>villain</em> pulls one of these is in the penultimate episode. Greer and Finch are locked in a room together, and Greer is able to trick Finch into admitting only he has the power to deploy the virus that can destroy Samaritan. In response to this Greer has all the oxygen from the room sucked out, knowing it will kill him but will also kill Finch thus eliminating the threat to Samaritan. Seeing as how he planned this there's no reason why he couldn't have immobilized Finch in some way prior and gave himself an escape route, or simply brought an oxygen mask. Furthermore it turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Senseless Sacrifice</a> as the rest of Team Machine show up in time to rescue Finch <em>anyway</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> had a couple of these:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em> they send Karone on a high risk mission to infiltrate the enemy base to stop an asteroid from hitting earth, immediately after she was exposed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">traitor</a> and before they try to stop it with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Megazords</a>. This is a rare-overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Senseless Sacrifice</a>, because they end up using them anyway.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder">Power Rangers Dino Thunder</a></em>, Tommy orders all the Zords to be sacrificed even though they still had two Super-Megazords that had not been used on the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>. It's worse when you watch the episode and realize it was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> creating a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">Only the Author Can Save Them Now</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Marian's death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em> involves her throwing herself between Guy of Gisborne and King Richard in order to prevent the former from killing the latter. How does she do this? By loudly proclaiming her love for Robin Hood, which causes Guy to stab her to death. There are a dozen ways she could have stopped Guy — heck, she only needed to stall him for a few seconds until the other outlaws showed up. Doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Senseless Sacrifice</a> since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionHeart">King Richard</a> dies in France the following year (and in the show's continuity, is still being held hostage in Austria when the show ends).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SleepyHollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SleepyHollow">Sleepy Hollow</a></em> Captain Irving confesses to the murder of two people, actually killed by his daughter while she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">possessed</a>. Now if his motive is purely to save her from the ordeal of being investigated for murder this is understandable if not very practical. But it's a pretty safe bet that if they did pursue this to trial, no jury is going to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that a skinny thirteen-year old in a wheelchair was able to break two men's necks with her bare hands, no matter what the physical evidence indicated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> Alicia Baker pulls this at the climax of an episode.

She survives, and Clark quickly incapacitates the foe. When Clark asks her why, she says it's because she promised him she would never reveal his secret, and allowing the therapist to shoot him would have done just that. She's a recovering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> by the way.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show lampshades then defies this, thanks to O'Neill. After successfully destroying the shield system on an invading Goa'uld motherships, they ponder their next move. The following dialogue occurs:
<div class="indent"><strong>O'Neill:</strong> Now what? <br/><strong>Bra'tac:</strong> Now, we die. <br/><strong>O'Neill:</strong> Well, <em>that's</em> a bad plan. Where's the glider bay?
</div></li><li> There's also an instance in the episode "Flesh and Blood", where Bra'tac attempts to ram their ha'tak into an Ori cruiser despite them witnessing firsthand that their weapons were ineffective (which is also pointed out by Sam). Mitchell (O'Neill's successor), being the guy he is, slaps a teleporter beacon onto Bra'tac when he isn't looking and has the <em>Odyssey</em> beam them all out before impact. Just as Sam predicted, the ha'tak's explosion doesn't even get past the Ori shields.
</li></ul></li><li> The death of the senator in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> pilot is rather senseless. Air is slowly leaking out a damaged porthole on a shuttle attached to the main ship and the control panel to close the door is in the shuttle. The senator sacrifices himself to save the rest of the crew, but given an hour or two (which they had) any decent engineer could have built something to press the button remotely. A lever on a string for instance. Or a flying remote-controlled camera drone, available from a vending machine aboard the <em>Destiny</em>. Interestingly, while his sacrifice was justified (he was almost certainly going to die from his injuries anyway, and they needed the air badly), Rush's mentality or taking the time to look for someone to sacrifice instead of engineering a solution isn't.

There's also the fact that Porom usually knows Teleport by the time this occurs, and there was absolutely no given reason for this slightly more logical way to escape not to work.
</li><li> Speaking of Tellah, the pointlessness of his own sacrifice was part of the plot — if he'd waited for everyone to wear Golbez down <em>before</em> using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack">Combined Energy Attack</a>, his sacrifice might have done a bit more than knock the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> back (though it did free Kain from his control and might have also shaken Zemus' control of Golbez long enough for the latter to stop himself from killing his own brother. After all, anger makes you stupid and reckless.
</li><li> All of the game's fake-out deaths are like this. Cid did not need to jump off the ship with a bomb — he's more than capable of building advanced remote controls, so it's hard to believe he didn't have a remote controlled detonator. Even assuming he didn't, jumping with the bomb would not alter its speed any. And going back a few minutes earlier, if all Yang did to stop the cannon was blow up the guns...why not just <em>walk out of the room with everyone else and let Rydia set it on fire or use one of her summons?!</em> There was no particular reason the sequence required him to stand in the room and die.

Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">she succeeds in saving Beat</a>, Rhyme also dooms him, seeing as people who've formed a 'pact' can't survive for more than a few minutes if their partner gets erased.

<ul><li> By the end of the game, you must step into a radiation-filled chamber and sacrifice yourself to complete the project your father started to bring clean water to the wasteland. If you're an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Evil player</a>, you can opt to convince Sarah Lyons to go in and kill herself instead. You can't, however, send in any of your followers which include: a Super Mutant who is immune to radiation, a robot who is also immune to radiation, your slave who is forced to obey your every whim lest you detonate her explosive collar (although that would be something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>), and a ghoul who is <em>healed</em> by radiation and is <em>also</em> your slave forced to obey your every whim (in his case through extensive brainwashing instead of a collar, so he is literally <em>incapable</em> of refusing your commands, except in this one particular instance for some reason). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Your rad-resistant armor fails, your anti-rad meds do crap.</a> You or Sarah <em>have</em> to go in and die horribly of radiation poisoning. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">It's just more dramatic this way, you see</a>. <br/><br/>And in an even worse implementation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>, the "fatal" rad poisoning doesn't do jack until you press the button and turn Project Purity on, at which point you instantly dissolve into goo. With enough Rad-X and RadAway, you could stay in the chamber <em>indefinitely</em>. In story, Colonel Autumn even demonstrated earlier that it's possible to spend an extended time in that chamber without ill effects. Thankfully, the devs retconned the ending with the <em>Broken Steel</em> expansion: Not only can you survive the radiation, you have the option of sending in your radiation immune companion in instead. <br/><br/>Even with the <em>Broken Steel</em> expansion, however, the end narration doesn't distinguish between your sending someone to die in your stead or just sending in someone who can't be killed by radiation, and the narrator chews you out for "cowardice" either way. Maybe they just didn't feel like creating a whole new cutscene and bringing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonPerlman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonPerlman">Ron Perlman</a> back to record a new voice-over. Or maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Watsonian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Watsonian">the narrator</a> was upset that you didn't end the story with a sacrifice appropriate for the Wasteland's messiah. Or maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doylist">the dev team</a> were just in a sulk because the fans were spoiling the drama with common sense. The rad-immune companions do get new dialog lines when you order them in that are varients of "oh yeah, that would make sense wouldn't it?" but they still have an element of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightlySelfRighteous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightlySelfRighteous">Rightly Self-Righteous</a> indignation that you wouldn't "full-fill your destiny" of going in and dying,
</li><li> The Lone Wanderer's dad's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> is also this, as he lets out radiation into the said chamber to keep the Enclave from using it and buy his son/daughter and the rest of the science team time to escape. Firstly, by that time, the Lone Wanderer probably has enough skill, weapons, and decent armor that he could wipe out the Enclave on his/her own. Secondly, he sacrifice somehow kills him but doesn't manage to kill Colonel Autumn.
<ul><li> In hindsight it may have been even stupider, since Colonel Autumn wanted to use the purifier solely for political gain (as opposed to the Enclave's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a>). The Brotherhood of Steel who ends up in control of it thanks to your actions ends up using it for... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">political gain,</a> stamping their logo on bottles of purified water and distributing to locations they approve of and have influence with. So it was basically a case of denying one absolutist authority control just so another (albeit a bit more reasonable and altruistic) absolutist authority could have it. Granted, it didn't help that Autumn acted like a psychotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> despite his reasonable goals.

And for that matter, there wasn't even that many bad guys. They could have <em>fought</em> their way out!

If he does not follow their orders, his subjects will start dropping like flies. Eventually he finds a solution - the signer must be killed to nullify the contract. Thus he asks the player to kill him (or the loyal general if the player refuses). As it turns out, the country is still bound by the pact. You must kill a signer <em>and</em> destroy the contract to break the curse. And the other signer is someone you end up killing regardless of whether or not Pelleas is alive, which means the contract would have been broken either way.

</li><li> Naomi, who commits suicide by destroying the nanomachines that were keeping her cancer in check. Aside from the fact that the explanation for this is wholly unsatisfactory (she never forgave herself for creating Vamp, but she wasn't even the one who <em>made</em> him, not to mention she'd finally helped stop him for good), but she left behind a newfound love interest and a girl who looked up to her. There was a spare seat for her in Metal Gear Rex, but she decides to stay behind and say her final words - to no one in particular. Good going.
</li><li> Big Boss. He decided to go out one day and place flowers on the Boss' gravestone, and took Major Zero with him. Then, he waited until Snake showed up (and almost killed himself). Only <em>then</em> did he decide to make his grand entrance. He spends twenty minutes tying up all the loose ends and plot holes seen throughout the series, performs the symbolic gesture of euthanizing Zero and then dies himself, knowing that Snake was carrying the mutated FOXDIE in him. Couldn't all of this just been solved by...a letter? A phone call? He shows up for the first time in four games, spouts expository dialogue and <em>then</em> knows it's time to die?
</li><li> Solid Snake, as a symbolic gesture of his suffering as a video game character, has to walk through a horrible 'microwave corridor' that cooks him alive in order to reach the evil computer powering the plot, with everyone around him (including him) well aware that this should kill him. However, the situation itself is rather contrived - it is only Otacon's presence (in the form of a remote-controlled robot drone) that is actually required to upload the virus into the computer.
</li><li> Snake actually asks Otacon to do one of these, half-seriously proposing Otacon 'jump off the ship with [him]' even though Otacon is not required to physically be on the Outer Haven ship and is required to complete the plan - possibly simply as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">an attempt to make Otacon feel guilty about a situation he's doing the right thing in</a>.

His kamikaze run doesn't seem quite as noble when you've got three capital ships, laden with <em>multiple</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave Motion Guns</a> and entire squadrons of fighter spacecraft, sitting in firing range. Or, y'know, if it wasn't actually possible to remotely control any ship you own even while extra-vehicular, the sacrifice would make sense. Sure, by all means send your ship to its destruction, but there's nothing in the rules that states you <em>have</em> to be in the damn thing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission">Mega Man X: Command Mission</a></em>, Aile rips a key device out of his own chest, hands it to X, and then shoves him out the door, seals it behind him, and proceeds to blow himself up to destroy a small group of incoming minor, pathetically weak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> that wouldn't really have stood much of a chance against X.
<ul><li> Later on, Spider sacrifices both himself and the level boss to create a big enough explosion to blast the door open before the base self-destructed. Except that at that point in the game, the team have more than enough firepower between them to create more damage than just two reploids exploding. Or even blow open their own door through the walls. Maybe he, being in actuality the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, just got sick of the charade?
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1">Mega Man X</a></em>, Zero blows himself up to destroy Vile's Ride Armor and give X a chance. Except...Zero was clinging to the back of the mech, where there were no weapons, no way for the arms to reach him, and Vile's exposed head is in front of him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">Maybe just blast him</a>? Then again, he may have tried that. It's a little hard to tell with 16-bit sprites, but still, the point stands. As demonstrated earlier in the game, when X uses the Ride Armor, it fully protected the rider (X does not take damage until the armor is destroyed). In addition, when the armor explodes, it can damage the pilot. What Zero did was unleash a strong enough dose of firepower to the Ride Armor to destroy it instantly, thereby (hopefully) destroying Vile. It didn't destroy Vile, but it did give X the chance to do so. Not entirely senseless, as he presumably could've done that from a distance, but still kind of stupid.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Ali</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">cia's</a> attempt to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Final Flame</a>. Thankfully it's an inversion because when you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">consider</a> that the whole point of her trying to blow up the Marmota with her powers was to save her friends and the capital, there's the matter of how close they are to said capital when she tries it. The blast radius is <em>huge</em> on that attack. If she'd managed to do it, Squad 7, and possibly Randgriz, would have been vaporized in the process.
<ul><li> It also bears mentioning that Alicia had done <em>dramatic</em> damage to the Marmotah simply with a basic attack. She had very nearly crippled it, and since Valkyrur are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">effectively invincible</a>, there was very little reason for her not to just hit it again. No suicide attack needed, aside from the fact that she stupidly threw her lance (a Valkyria's main weapon) into the Marmota for no real reason thus forcing the silly suicide dilemma when she could've just sat there and blasted its radiators until it was a smoking ruin.
</li><li> Justified in this case; Alicia was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">in a very poor state of mind</a> at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> Also Faldio. It's especially jarring that the sacrifice is made to kill an enemy who's already been defeated, had his power source disconnected, and too weighed down by equipment he can't properly lift to be much of a threat anymore. But, since the game is a strongly idealist war story, Faldio is both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedEvil">a device to keep Welkin from having to do anything morally questionable</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathEqualsRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathEqualsRedemption">obligated to die</a> to deliver the game's equally idealist Aesops.
</li><li> Ditto Selvaria, whose sacrifice failed on every possible level. She could have just killed everybody at Ghirlandaio with regular weapons and gotten the same result, except it'd take longer and she'd be alive. Moreover, since she negotiated for Squad 7 to be spared in order for them to escort her own soldiers home, she ensured her sacrifice meant nothing, since Squad 7 is the one that has <em>the now-unopposed other Valkyria in it</em>. In this case, however, the stupidity of the act is part of the tragedy; she had been ordered to do it by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubordinateExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubordinateExcuse">beloved superior</a> who decided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">she had outlived her usefulness</a> now that he had a means to give himself her powers.
</li><li> Selvaria knew what she was doing when she let Squad 7 go. They were the only ones she could trust to take her men to safety. And as for the threat they posed to said Superior? Well, he'd just have to deal with that on his own. Selvaria had sworn a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife">life-debt</a> to the man, but it didn't necessarily mean that she shared his beliefs or goals.
</li></ul></li><li> Saidra sacrifices herself in a mission of the original campaign in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, by attacking a group of Mursaat that are pursuing you. Now, since the Mursaat were pretty much unkillable for the player at this stage thanks to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">Spectral agony</a>, it might make sense. Unfortunately, the cutscene where she announces her sacrifice and says farewells and what not takes about a minute. The players party, nor the NPCs, move during this time. Once the cutscene ends and you can finally start running, you can see Saidra dying within 10 seconds, after which the (slow moving) Mursaat continue chasing you. Without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction">Talking Is a Free Action</a>, this means she gave her life so you could be delayed by 50 seconds.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> lampshades at least one example, when Blood Legion Charr try to recruit an honorable Charr gladium. He's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> of his squad, just barely escaping an assault by a particularly deadly ghost warrior, and when you catch up with him, is primed to give his life to take that ghost down. Except, as the player character can point out, killing ghosts — and especially ghosts that come back in a couple weeks — is a rather lackluster revenge to die for.

Instead of, well, <em>going through</em> the door, the grandfather tells David to run, engages Fuge in a hopeless fight (he has to actually <em>run away from the door</em> to do that) and is promptly killed. Then it gets weird. Instead of obliging and bailing, David just stands and watches his grandfather getting killed. But after the cutscene figt ends, Fuge... just stands there and does nothing as well. You can even attack him (and get killed) or you can just go through the door.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey">Epic Mickey</a></em>, when Oswald got appalled at Mickey giving away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">his heart</a>.
</li><li> Orsino in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, when the player's Hawke pursues siding with the mages near the end of the game, becomes so desperate after Meredith and the templars storm the Circle that he ends up turning to blood magic and transforming himself into a Harvester, merging the bodies of dead mages with himself. As the Harvester is basically a mindless creature that simply feeds on blood and attacks both the templars and Hawke's companions, this means that the player ends up wasting time having to kill Orsino.
<ul><li> This is lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>. The Inquisitor can ask Varric about his book about Hawke's adventures and one of the questions is how Orsino's fate made no sense. The most that Varric is able to come up with is that he was just desperate.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a> 6</em>, Lieutenant Santiago teleports in to help Roger escape from a room filling with deadly gas, throwing him into the elevator as the piston keeping it open collapses and traps her in an exploding room it was a ruse to kidnap her. Ignoring the question on why they didn't just teleport Roger out, if she hadn't appeared, they wouldn't have wasted precious seconds talking to each other about how they need to escape the room he was already trying to escape.
</li><li> According to Ammon Jerro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a>: Mask of the Betrayer</em>, the previous campaign's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard">Spoony Bard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGnomesAreWeirder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGnomesAreWeirder">Grobnar Gnomehands</a> threw himself in front of a falling stone pillar to save the Construct.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace">Freespace</a> 2</em>, a damaged GTVA <em>Colossus</em> dukes it out with a Shivan <em>Sathanas</em> juggernaut in order to buy the GTD <em>Bastion</em> time to collapse the Epsilon-Pegasi jump node. However, given the fact that the <em>Colossus</em> just sits there and the <em>Sathanas</em> is vastly more powerful, the <em>Colossus</em> only lasts about 30 seconds. And in the event, the <em>Sathanas</em> never actually attempts to engage the <em>Bastion</em> anyway. In fact, using the <em>Bastion</em> to collapse the jump node may have been an entirely pointless endeavour from the beginning, since the Shivans were inducing the system's sun to go supernova, possibly in order to create an artificial wormhole or jump node.

Samara, a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> is just about to commit suicide as her code requires that her daughter live in a monastery to isolate a dangerous genetic disorder, and most of that monastery had just gotten blown up. The code requires that she kill her daughter to keep her from getting out, but her motherly love prevents her from doing that, so killing herself is the only resolution. If you just keep her from blasting her brains out for long enough, the daughter will point out that it's not like the walls were physically keeping her in in the first place, and there's still plenty of space for her to live in. Becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Senseless Sacrifice</a> (and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment on your part) where you can execute her daughter immediately afterward, as she's an Ardat-Yakshi and therefore a threat.

<ul><li> This later becomes a recurring theme with Jim, who tries to sacrifice his characters in a heroic, noble, and totally <em>pointless</em> fashion at any available opportunity, even when the GM tries giving him outs. Eventually, Ben gets wise and has his character tackle Jim's before he can do anything at all.

But what made the tunnel go down was the vibrations from his boombox. Instead of standing next to it, continuously "rocking out" until the rocks crush him, he simply could have left the box and ran. Though at the time he mentioned he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">tired of life...</a>
</li><li> Another episode, "Lrrreconcilabe Ndndifferences", has Fry jump in the way of what he assumes to be a disintegrator ray, saving Leela's life, however he turns out to be just fine as it was a teleporter ray, making the jump nothing more than a good gesture, but otherwise totally pointless. When they find him alive and okay, he's writing his third revision to his comic "Delivery Boy Man". The ending he comes up with is to have Delivery Boy Man to dive in front of a death laser to save the heroine, however he jumps too early before the alien even fires. Luckily the alien is hit by a convenient meteor killing himself, and Delivery Boy Man saves the heroine, as she puts it, "By random chance".

The tribal chief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> the foolishness of the sacrifice by pointing out that they could have just pushed the car in. This is subverted, though, as Monkey and Odie climb out of the volcano alive. Further subversion: Monkey states after climbing out of the volcano, "We've gotta fix those brakes." Apparently, the plan <em>was</em> to just push the car in, but they were driving the car up the volcano as fast as they could, and apparently, the brakes didn't work, so the car went over the edge.

Then Long was shot once more for good measure.

While Red Skull is dangerous as a strategist he should have been no match for Captain America and his team of superhero allies. Once they are both freed in the present Cap eventually makes the exact same sacrifice again. The second case is perhaps even more stupid since Electro was clearly a much greater threat. Electro may have been more powerful, but it turned out the vortex was created for the express purpose of keeping him in line, which would make the Red Skull just as much a threat to Electro, even more so. With him gone, there's no-one else with the willingness to use it (and eventually Electro himself is trapped in it).
