However, this is largely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a> since virtually every time she's seen, it's with concern for helping her student Hinata to recover from his childhood trauma.

They fail Himeji on her placement exam despite the fact that she was having a <strong>medical emergency.</strong> They blatantly insult the students of Class F, calling them idiots to their faces. No one ever seems to break it up whenever Minami beats the everloving crap out of Akihisa. How these people became educators is anyone's guess.

</li><li> In the manga, there's an interlude during the Sugimura/Kotohiki section that talks about Jaguar, a gym teacher they had.

When Gohan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">stands up to him</a> and damages his whip in the process, Mr. Shu quickly calls in Chi-Chi and makes Gohan seem like the bad guy... before declaring that Goku's abandonment drove Gohan to such violence and proceeding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">whip Gohan across the face hard enough to draw blood right in front of Chi-Chi</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Bad idea.</a> Chi-Chi promptly goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a> on his ass, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration">throwing him out the window</a> and chasing him off of their property all while screaming at him never to come back.

<ul><li> Played for laughs with the gym teacher. He genuinely hates Sōsuke, but Sōsuke just sees him as a respectable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a>. Whenever the teacher goes on a tirade against him, Sōsuke treats him like an officer, which he considers back-talk. When the gym teacher attempts to sabotage the students' bread sales, he runs afoul of Sōsuke's traps and gets sent to the hospital — but Sōsuke mistakenly interprets his symptoms as overwork and mentally wishes the teacher a speedy recovery.

All three found themselves on the receiving end of karma in the end, though (the Vamp had her makeup peeled off, revealing how ugly she really was to the whole class; the counselor was revealed to be bald and wearing a toupee; the gym teacher got turned into an RPG figurine by Dark Bakura).
</li><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">The Vamp</a>, Chono, likes ordering desk inspections so that she can catch students with contraband and have them expelled.

</li></ul></li><li> Chronos/Crowler shows some sadistic tendencies in the GX manga, like when he forced Judai and Sho to duel each other after Sho got a zero on a test (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which wasn't even his actual grade, as it was a preliminary form, and the zero was a formality since he'd forgotten to write his name</span>), and Judai had failed every test since entering.

The latter forces Kuwabara and his friends to swear off violence under threat of Okubo losing permission for his job, which he needs to provide for his family. When the students keep their end of the bargain, he forces them to score above 50% on the next test. When even Kuwabara succeeds, he alters his test score to provoke him to hit him and break the agreement, but he relents with Yusuke's help. Mr. Iwamoto takes items out of students' bags to frame Yusuke, and keeps one student's pen for himself. Mr. Akashi isn't seen after Takanaka catches him altering Kuwabara's test score, so his ass probably <em>was</em> fired.
<ul><li> When Yusuke dies in the first episode of the series, these two actually discuss how happy they are that they don't have to put up with him anymore. <em>At his funeral.</em>

</li><li> Two other teachers in a manga-only arc did their utmost to set their prize pupils at each other's throats in a competition to see who in their school would be able to produce the one student who would go on to a prestigious high school. The fact that the girls in question had been friends before they did this didn't matter to them.

The students who died while at school and went to hell are all resurrected, as is an old headmaster who proceeds to openly torture and torment the student body using old-school punishments. He is <em>literally</em> a teacher from hell.

Aptly named the "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PROfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PROfessor">PR Ofessor</a>", the strip showed a professor (implied to be teaching chemistry) throughout a year at Colorado State University. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, since half the stuff would get a professor fired faster than you can say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>. Such antics included:
<ul><li> Scheduling office hours at the same time as lectures
<ul><li> Then misleading students about the physical location of his office with signs pointing to the other door.
</li></ul></li><li> Apparently holding his teacher's assistants captive
</li><li> Miscalculating someone's grade by 20 points, then taking 20 points as a regrading fee
</li><li> And on the final, stapling the syllabus for the next class (taught by him) to the test and saying "Since most of you guys are going to fail anyways, I'm going to get a head-start!"
</li></ul></li><li> Mrs. Wormwood from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em> is an interesting take on this trope. Calvin (being Calvin) believes his behavior is justified, even appropriate, so when she doles out completely reasonable punishments, it appears to him that she is a sadist. In reality, it's a combination of her being both the worst possible teacher for a student like Calvin, and Calvin being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Sadist Student.</a>

One instance included handing out a test that just says "Explain World War II." To say nothing of the books they assign for them to read in a very short period of time, like "Gulliver's Travels," "A Tale of Two Cities," "Anna Karenina," and "Tess of the d'Ubervilles." Some of these assignments would be daunting even for some college students, let alone elementary school students.

<ul><li> Wackford Squeers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NicholasNickleby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NicholasNickleby">Nicholas Nickleby</a></em>. He runs an orphanage full of unwanted children and asks for a large fee. Then he starves and mistreats them while using the money sent by their parents to pad his own pockets. He and his wife regularly beat up the children, while spoiling their own son. The character was rumored to have been based on a notorious English headmaster, William Shaw, who once beat a boy so badly that he turned blind. Dickens denied the claims, however, out of fear of libel.

Even given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorporalPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorporalPunishment">Corporal Punishment</a> was the standard in all schools of the time, Twain's descriptions make it clear that Dobbins is just a little too quick and a lot too harsh with the hickory stick. Twain's detail, "His rod and his ferule were seldom idle nowat least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing," implies he's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">cautious about "disciplining" students who might fight back.</a>

He forces the students of Prufrock Preparatory School to attend six hour concerts, and punishment for not showing up is having to buy him a large bag of candy and watch him eat it. He also loves mimicking the Baudelaire siblings every chance he gets, forces them to live in a horrible little shack infested with crabs and fungus, and makes Sunny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">(a toddler)</a> his secretary.

</li><li> Subverted with Mr. Remora and Mrs. Bass, who are not evil so much as they are very, very bad teachers. Remora's class consists of him endlessly telling short, boring stories while eating bananas, and Bass is obsessed with measuring things. When they are forced to give the Baudelaires "special exams" for sleeping in class (which they studied for thanks to notes collected by Duncan and Isadora Quagmire), by the third question they realize Violet and Klaus are actually very smart students, and only continue the exam because of Nero. They ask Nero if they can give an extra hard exam to Carmelita Spats instead because she's so awful, and when Nero decides he's going to expel the Baudelaires anyway for skipping gym, Remora and Bass state it's not cheating if you're trying to make sure athletics don't affect your schoolwork.

He wants to be called <em>captain</em> instead of headmaster (which was his rank during the war). He is described as spying on the children while rustling his moustache hairs in order to catch them on tiny mistakes. In the book, he hears Danny and his schoolboy friend talk while finishing an exercise. He immediately orders them to come forward and beats their hands with a very thin cane. Dahl based this teacher on one of his actual headmasters, a certain Captain Hardcastle. The incident described in the novel is almost word-for-word a real anecdote between Hardcastle and Dahl, described in Dahl's autobiography <em>Boy</em>.

The most notable ones are Mr. Krupp, the principal, who blackmailed the two into basically becoming his slaves in the first book, and Ms. Ribble, George and Harold's teacher, who started out by forcing her students to perform in a lousy retirement party (including having one kid stand in a corner for making his picture too happy), planned on failing George and Harold for a small prank gone wrong, and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> undergoes a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> after becoming the super-villain Wedgie Woman.

A notable example: the class is Graphic Design, the assignment is to illustrate a word with appropriate form for the word's content. A student presents his rendition of "HOT" made of match-heads stuck to posterboard with rubber cement. Sorbeck scowls at this and has the student touch it. Is his finger warmed? No? So it's not very hot, is it, which would make it an F. The student loses some composure — at which point Sorbeck tosses him a cigarette lighter and points out that he can remedy the situation. After a little browbeating, the student lights his work, resulting in a brief, intense conflagration and a large scorch mark on the wall. Sorbeck blandly comments that it was an A while it was going.

</li></ul><ul><li> Lucy Maud Montgomery's heroines almost always fall victim to this teacher. Probably the worst offender was Miss Brownell, of <em>Emily of New Moon</em> fame. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a> shows her slapping Emily across the face right in the middle of class as a way of scolding Emily for asking a question out loud and not doing her arithmetic, which any person can agree was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>. Her worst offense was taking Emily's manuscripts in class and reading aloud Emily's poems in a mocking voice, with snide comments, and occasionally accusing Emily of passing off other author's works as her own. When Emily refused to apologize for writing poetry in class, Miss Brownell came to New Moon and tried to convince Emily's guardian to force the girl to <em>kneel</em> to Miss Brownell and apologize.
<ul><li> The TV series topped her with an even worse male teacher who made racist remarks and beat an Indian boy for not answering him fast enough, then beat Emily when she tried to stop him.

<ul><li> Snape is an example of this, given how bad his mood is or if your name's Harry or Neville or Ron or, to a slightly lesser extent, Hermione (he seems to respect her intelligence) or, to a somewhat even lesser extent, anyone who is not a Slytherin. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The fact that he indirectly orphaned Harry makes it even worse.</span> Highlights include testing potions on Neville's pet (which, it should be pointed out, would have killed the toad if Hermione hadn't helped Neville) and verbally abusing him even outside the classroom. Harry and Neville find the OWL exams from Potions less stressful than a class, because Snape isn't overseeing them. Grand prize probably goes to when Draco and Harry duel during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>.</em> Their curses rebound, causing Goyle and Hermione to get hit. Goyle is sent to the hospital wing, and points are taken off of Gryffindor. When Ron shows Snape that Hermione's teeth have grown like those of a beavers, he looks at the fifteen-year-old girl and says coolly, "I see no difference." But even he can't compete with...

They force the students to practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyBeam">torture curses</a> on students who got detention—including 11-year-old first years.

</li></ul></li><li> Mrs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">Gorf</a> in the first book of Louis Sachar's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaysideSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaysideSchool">Wayside School</a></em> series turns her students into <em>apples</em> when they do anything wrong. Including sneezing in class. The students manage to outsmart her by forcing her to turn them back into humans and tricking her into turning herself into an apple, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Louis</a> then unknowingly eats.
<ul><li> Wendy Nogard in <em>Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger</em> is a more subtle (but even more insidious) example: while she appears to be a sweet, considerate teacher, she uses her mind-reading abilities to humiliate and turn her students against each other — all without ever compromising her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">"nice teacher" facade</a>. An example of this is when, during a homework-checking session, she deliberately calls on the one student who has the incorrect answer for each question, and using the resulting slew of wrong answers to retract her promise of no homework for that day. Every student ends up hating all the others for being idiots who cheated him/her out of a homework-free afternoon, even though in reality none of them missed more than two questions on the assignment.
</li><li> Wayside School had terrible luck with their substitute teachers.
<ul><li> Their first one, Mr. Gorf, was actually the son of Mrs. Gorf and had the freakish ability to steal the voices of people through his <em>nose</em>! Which had three nostrils! Then, when he had stolen the students' voices, he called their parents up and used their voices to say terrible things, making their parents think the kids hated them.
</li><li> Their second substitute, Ms. Drazil, seemed very nice at first but turned out to be the yard teacher Louis's old teacher and according to him had humiliated him over the state of his nails and put a wastebasket over his head so he couldn't read the board and failed him as a result of not being able to answer the questions. While she never does any of this to the Wayside kids, she does resume her tyrannical control over Louis which is enough to make the students hate her. Oh, and it's later revealed that she kept a blue notebook with information on various students she held grudges with and upon getting a lead on a girl who escaped, tracks down said girl (now a successful dentist) and breaks into her house yelling that the girl has homework to do. And the girl was <em>expecting</em> something like this to happen, even keeping a suitcase and getaway boat for the occasion!
</li><li> Oddly, it's implied the reason Ms. Drazil was so nice to the Wayside kids because she was trying to atone for her former strict tendencies. The unexpected arrival of Louis and the dentist force her right back into her old habits when she chases the latter down.
</li><li> Even the regular teachers aren't always safe. One chapter in <em>Wayside School is Falling Down</em> comments that every nice teacher has a mean teacher wanting to break out and illustrates this by showing a class in which Ms Jewel's "mean teacher" breaks out and threatens to dump pickle brine on a student for being unable to answer three questions (to be fair, the questions were "what's seven plus five", "what's the capital of England", and "how do you make pickles" and she is cured by having brine dumped on herself).
</li><li> The principal, named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Mr. Kidswatter</a>, is apparently a holy terror and students dread going to his office. At one point, the intercom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThisThingStillOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThisThingStillOn">catches him going on about how much he hates kids</a>.

Lewis' own unfortunate experience with his first headmaster. Though interestingly in this case, the Head's cruelty is a case of neglectful <em>lack</em> of discipline that coddles a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies">Gang of Bullies</a> who take over the school and terrorize the other students. The Head indulges the bullies because they are "interesting cases." (At the end, when the other teachers finally realize the Head is incompetent at her job, they get her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">a promotion</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">to the Ministry of Education</a>.

After Laura taunts Nellie with the fact that Mr. Oleson isn't on the school board and Laura's dad is, Nellie retaliates by convincing Miss Wilder that Laura is fomenting all the trouble in school because she thinks she's untouchable. Miss Wilder's growing spite, as the class' rebellion gets more and more open, eventually leads to her imposing a far too harsh punishment on Laura's sickly little sister Carrie for a minor offense (and even though another girl was equally guilty, Eliza Jane let her escape the punishment). Things eventually get so out-of-control that the school board is called in, and Miss Wilder takes the opportunity to triumphantly denounce Laura to her father... except that Laura, oblivious to any of this subtext, has actually been trying her best to <em>discourage</em> the mischief, and is stunned. We never do find out if Miss Wilder learns the truth, but apparently when she became Laura's sister-in-law a few years later their relationship was notably strained. Go figure.
<ul><li> The first season of the TV series also had an episode that featured a sadistic substitute teacher.

Rumour amongst the students is that if you get him as the examiner for your final exam, you might as well kill yourself immediately and save time. The events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">Pyramids</a></em> show this isn't <em>entirely</em> true, although he does expect the student to identify a thiefsign he's "accidentally" holding upside down.
</li></ul><ul><li> An extremely mild case of this trope applies to Fudge's first kindergarten teacher in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume">Judy Blume</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Superfudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Superfudge">Superfudge</a></em>. While actual deliberate cruelty is not shown, she refuses to call him "Fudge" even when this sends him into screaming fits, and her students behave like little robots without a spark of individuality. "Fudge" actually tells off the teacher at the very end of the chapter by calling her 'Rat Face'.
</li><li> Osip Senkovsky is portrayed as this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathOfTheVazirMukhtar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathOfTheVazirMukhtar">The Death of the Vazir Mukhtar</a></em>, when asked to preside over an exam in the School of Oriental Languages. He is passive-agressive, demanding, perfectionistic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">hammy</a> as he bombards hapless students with questions about and demands for translations of Arabic and Persian poetry.

</li><li> In Louis Sachar's <em>Someday Angeline,</em> Mrs. Hardlick is one of the sixth-grade teachers, and the titular Angeline, eight-year-old child genius, has the misfortune to be sent to her class. Mrs. Hardlick frequently gives the class wrong information and gets angry when Angeline corrects her, <em>and</em> takes immense delight in telling students that they answered incorrectly. On her first day of class, Angeline is driven to tears and sucks on her thumb to console herself, prompting Mrs. Hardlick to taunt her about it in front of the whole class (who start laughing at her), and gleefully tells her "Only <em>babies</em> suck their thumbs!" After Angeline's father forces her to resign from being "Secretary of Trash" (meaning she empties the garbage bin), Hardlick refuses to listen, or to let her resign, and then says she'll send a letter to Angeline's mother about her—simply tossing an uncaring "Too bad," when the girl tries to tell her that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">her mother is dead.</a> When Angeline later reads said letter, she finds Hardlick didn't even bother writing to her <em>father,</em> but wrote to her mother even after being told her mother was dead, then made it sound like Angeline was loud, disruptive, and destructive—all lies. (Even the other teachers know how horrible Hardlick is—the fifth-grade teacher, Miss Turbone, admits "If I were in [Mrs. Hardlick's] class, I'd [skip school], too.")

He's a sadistic school master who at one point makes a girl have all her hair cut off for the "sin" of curling it (ignoring the protests that it's naturally curly).

</li><li> Reese's teacher Mr. Woodward from before Herkabe showed up. Malcolm figured it out when he proofread an F on one of Reese's papers that for once he didn't deserve, along with the teacher's "Kids like Reese..." speech.

He's also a nicer person when he gets home, and Rani and her mother Gita make fun of him for his stern streak.
</li><li> Sue Sylvester from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>. From her brutal yet efficient ways of training the 'Cheerios' cheerleading squad, to the way she throws things around and almost throws a kid out of a corridor when she's angry in one episode, you'd be hard pressed to find someone worse than her (Roald Dahl notwithstanding). Even then, admittedly, it's only done mainly for comedy purposes... Surprisingly enough she's a reasonable principal (with the exceptions of trying to disband football and fire Will. That she relents when she sees him as a very competent teacher). She even responds to the bullying in the school better than Figgins ever did, and does seem genuinely upset that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she couldn't protect Kurt</span>. She has her reasons for this - bullying someone for being different seems to be her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>. Although she ruthlessly terrorizes the school, she is very much an equal-opportunity bully, and the kids know it.

Despite being a <em>nun</em>, she shows blatant favoritism towards London, always punishing Maddie for things that London does. One episode has her giving Maddie detention for "tempting" London when she accidentally violated a copyright while writing a kid's book. London was the one that decided to blow the entire thing out of proportion and have her book published. Another episode (one where Maddie is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>) has her giving Maddie a pamphlet that was at least 30 years old to get her to come over to a camp. Said camp is a horrible place (they're across the street from a slaughterhouse and they once had <em>leech cobbler</em> as a meal). However, given that she <em>is</em> a nun, she is a downplayed example, and she is generally nice. It usually shows because of Maddie's less-than-positive or complaining attitude towards others.
<ul><li> This is somewhat justified. London is a well-meaning idiot who rarely intentionally tries to do something wrong, whereas Maddie is a snarky little witch who constantly makes mean-spirited insults to everyone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">even if she has a point</a>.

Initially, this jealousy leads Saskia to undermine Tara's confidence and bully her both in and outside of class. Later, in a private pas de deux class, she forces Tara into a dangerous stretch that results in a <em>broken vertebra</em>, leaving Tara courting paraplegia with every step.

Will tells his friends a story about the teacher walking into a rowdy class, forcing everyone to admit to how they'd been misbehaving, and hitting each on the hand with a ruler in turn. When it was Will's turn, he told him, quite honestly, that he'd done nothing but sit there trying to ignore everyone else. Mad Dog ignored him, repeated the question and continued hitting Will, who refused to change his story. It went on long enough for another teacher to hear them from the hallway and intervene, and Mad Dog was fired.

<ul><li> Wrestling school in general is this, by a combination of tradition and necessity. First of all, no matter how choreographed it is, wrestling <em>hurts</em>. And it hurts more when you're learning how to take the expected bumps. There's also a belief in the industry that the training has to be brutal as a safeguard to keep out the insufficiently determined — if the training is sadistically painful, only the kids determined enough to become wrestlers that they'll <em>always</em> put the business first stick with it. Lastly, in a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">Enforced Method Acting</a>, wrestlers are often taught to sell submission holds by the trainer applying the hold to the point of significant discomfort. This practice is known as "stretching." This trope regards to wrestling finally got a major overhaul in 2020 when the 'Speaking Out' movement exposed several trainers (most notably Ricky and Saraya Knight) whose methods were outright abusive and demeaning, all under the guise of "paying your dues".
</li><li> Very common in the Japanese pro wrestling scene, where training regimes tend to be extremely hard. Pretty much every puroresu company has had at least one sadist trainer in its dojo.
<ul><li> Kotetsu Yamamoto from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> was <em>feared</em> by his trainees, but after his retire, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RikiChoshu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RikiChoshu">Riki Choshu</a> and his apprentice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KensukeSasaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KensukeSasaki">Kensuke Sasaki</a> became the worst offenders. It's said that Sasaki killed a student named Hiromitsu Gompei who failed to impress Choshu during a training session, and years after, an elite wrestling prospect named Giant Ochiai died under suspicious circumstances in a dojo run by Choshu. In general, the NJPW Dojo has also been subject to allegations of abuse for years.
</li><li> During the 90s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a> trainers were accused of physically and sexually assaulting the students of its dojo. An especially ugly rumor has an apprentice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SatoshiKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SatoshiKojima">Satoshi Kojima</a> choosing to quit wrestling due to Kojima's advances on him.

</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> cites in his book, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GenichiroTenryu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GenichiroTenryu">Genichiro Tenryu</a> used to order his students from Wrestle Association R dojo to be repeatedly beaten up for no reason.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SatoruSayama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SatoruSayama">Satoru Sayama</a> was a incredibly cruel and harsh trainer both in wrestling and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> promotions, to the extent that there are clips of him beating students with a shinai cane. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KarlGotch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KarlGotch">Karl Gotch</a> supposedly remarked that Sayama was a great trainer yet an equally great gym bully.
</li><li> In the old Fighting Network RINGS promotion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AkiraMaeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AkiraMaeda">Akira Maeda</a> once assaulted his trainee Wataru Sakata during a post match interview (with the TV camera running!) after the latter performed too bad for Maeda's liking.

</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FMW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FMW">FMW</a> wrestlers claim to have passed beatings and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">humiliating</a> initiation ceremonies in the FMW Dojo.
</li></ul></li><li> Old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Catchascatchcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Catchascatchcan">catch</a> wrestlers like Billy Robinson and Stu Hart were very, very sadistic towards their trainees. It's said that The Dungeon, Hart's training gym, had holes on the walls from slamming people against them while sparring.
</li><li> Stu Hart refused to let any of 'the boys' in his area train Desiree Petersen on the grounds that they were "mean" and sent her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand">south of the border</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheFabulousMoolah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheFabulousMoolah">The Fabulous Moolah</a> instead. Apparently that didn't end up being any better, as Judy Martin, Mildred Burke, Penny Mitchell and Princess Victoria are named as her trainers in the states but Moolah isn't.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WendiRichter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WendiRichter">Wendi Richter</a> named The Fabulous Moolah as such. In order to train with her, she had to pay a sizable entrance fee and also rent an apartment from her - and she had to work at Wendy's to pay for that in addition to her grueling training. Moolah would also encourage the trainees to make themselves sexually available to promoters, while also taking a large portion of their booking fees, which she continued to do while Wendi was working with WWF for a while<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note37ccw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note37ccw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note37ccw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">When Wendi finally appealed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> and got all her pay sent directly to her, Moolah tried to injure her in the next match they had together.</span>. The kicker? According to Wendi, Moolah never trained the girls personally and just got her more experienced girls to do it.
</li><li> To the surprise of no one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NelsonErazo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NelsonErazo">Homicide</a> admitted to brainstorming and actively searching out new ways to make his students miserable such as wearing abrasive material or dipping his hands in chemicals to burn their eyes. Most of his students interviewed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">play it for laughs</a> though some of his already established peers have joked there would be more good wrestlers if so many up and comers weren't too scared to get training from him.
</li><li> These allegations have followed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>'s farm leagues for years. Specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline">Jacqueline</a> was accused of working trainees at Ohio Valley Wrestling to the point of injury while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory">Ivory</a> was said to be verbally demeaning and abusive. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobHolly">Bob Holly</a> gained infamy for beating <em>Tough Enough 3</em> winner Matt Cappotelli to a bloody pulp in training and later giving him a concussion(the internal bleeding was said to be accidental). Rip Rogers was known for beating wrestlers who messed up on OVW shows with a kendo stick afterwards(and he was a favorite of the students). Meanwhile, Deep South Wrestling trainer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillDeMott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillDeMott">Bill DeMott</a> was accused of physically abusing students and Kevin Matthews produced a picture on Twitter of DeMott over seeing a naked wrestler giving a stink face to a trainee. DeMott defended his actions by saying he was often acting on the orders of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis">John Laurinaitis</a> (yet it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a> who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">fired</a> for slapping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SantinoMarella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SantinoMarella">a trainee</a> who got a fan hurt when Laurinaitis lectured him on liability issues of publicly traded companies).
</li><li> The trope is at least nominally acknowledged by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> Quebec's school, which is known as "Onyx and LuFisto's Torture Chamber".

He had a Piper's Pit-style segment called "Matt Striker's Classroom," where he insulted the fans and the faces as intellectually inferior — all while playing up the heels as his friends. Naturally, his behavior led to plenty of feuds with his opponents wanting to shut him up.
</li><li> Terry Taylor: His gimmick as the Red Rooster during the late 1980s WWF, a novice wrestler guided by his "teacher"  Bobby "the Brain" Heenan. In promos prior to Taylor's debut, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyHeenan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyHeenan">Bobby Heenan</a> boasted that he was such a great manager and teacher that he could turn a "mediocre" wrestler into a feared championship contender. Naturally, Heenan succeeded only in embarrassing Taylor, often yelling at him, belittling him in interviews (e.g., "Maybe he's not the fastest wrestler" or "He often doesn't hit hard enough," etc.) and at least once slapping him after he lost a match.

</li><li> The whole initial incident boils down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Stern Teacher</a> Raven assuming Grace and Ellen are typical high school kids and them assuming he's typical high school teacher.
</li></ul></li><li> Conversely, the math teacher offered a subversion — although he initially seemed like he was going to be one of these, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2007-12-17">giving a Ellen and Grace a hard time for their improbable coincidences<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he quickly revealed he was actually fooling around and in fact turned out to be quite nice.
</li></ul></li><li> In a surprising move, the titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan">Dominic Deegan</a></em> is a subversion of the Sadist Teacher trope; yes, he teaches a very difficult class, but his reputation precedes him, and he's in fact a very approachable person.
<ul><li> How is that a subversion, exactly? Not every case of a teacher <em>not</em> being a sadist is a subversion.
</li><li> It's a subversion in that, while he has a reputation as an incredibly difficult teacher, all of his students love him and are better people because of him, he never humiliates or bullies them in any way, and they all actively try to help him in every way they can. The class is hard because the <em>subject</em> is hard, not because he's a bad teacher. In fact, all of his students considered him their favorite, and were devastated when his reputation as a "hard" teacher caused him to get fired.

</li><li> An arc in <em>So You're A Cartoonist?</em> involves Curmudgeonly Carl, a substitute art teacher who verbally eviscerates an artistic hopeful's style and abilities to the point where the kid is at a loss for words. However, Carl quickly turns into more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Stern Teacher</a>, since not only does the kid in question has an over-inflated sense of his own ability and <em>really</em> needed to be brought down a peg, but Carl actually gives him pointers and tells him that he <em>does</em> have potential, his skills just need fine-tuning. The arc ends with the kid trying what Carl suggested, but mumbling to himself, "I still hate that old coot."
<ul><li> In his second appearance, Carl's calmed down considerably, and offers to help the same kid with his portfolio after an abysmal college fair visit, if he agrees to visit the college fair every year so Carl can critique his work personally. The kid balks at the idea, until Carl smugly reminds him the college he's representing is the only one in the state that has a comic art degree program. The kid begrudgingly agrees, claiming he <em>still</em> hates that old coot.

<ul><li> Erik Mahren, the ex-Marine range master on Range 4 (the heavy weapons range) is notorious for being absolutely ruthless when it comes to weapons safety, but the net result of that is that no students are hurt or killed on the ranges in his entire tenure as rangemaster.
</li><li> The Reverend Darren England has gone after a couple students when he senses their connection to planet-threatening evil... but goes <em>way</em> over the line when he hires Syndicate hitmen to help some of his minions try to assassinate one such student (who happens to be one of the good guys).
</li><li> The closest thing to the "sadist teacher" archetype seen at Whateley so far would actually be Amelia Hartford, though she ends up being more of a highly placed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeanBitterman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeanBitterman">Dean Bitterman</a> due to not actually having a teaching position (that we've seen thus far).

<ul><li> One episode hints that his mistreatment is him projecting his pain from the overly tight high-heeled shoes he insists on wearing. Another episode implies that cultivating such a fearsome reputation is what keeps the students in-line.

She treated his mother even worse, mocking her every failure throughout her entire <em>life</em>, even outside of school.
</li><li> Subversion in Mr. Ratburn of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em>: Ratburn is feared as the strictest and toughest teacher in the school, so his reputation lives up to the trope. However, he is an excellent teacher in spite of, or indeed because of his strictness, and several episodes feature him outside of school in order to humanize him.
<ul><li> One episode revealed he had an even worse teacher, who was also very competent for the same reasons, when he was in school (he was taught Latin in 3rd grade!).
</li><li> When a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedKindergartenTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedKindergartenTeacher">Misplaced Kindergarten Teacher</a> took his place one day, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWantOurJerkBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWantOurJerkBack">everyone wanted Mr. Ratburn back by the day's end.</a>

<ul><li> The substitute teacher Mrs. Grimley takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. She makes the students sit facing the wall, she does not allow passing notes in class, drifting off into space, hall passes, talking, smiling, laughing, or breathing (if she hears you doing it), and she forces them to write essays for minor infractions. The essays get longer as the episode goes on. She makes Ginger, Miranda, and Courtney write <em>16,000-word essays</em> for passing a note in class (and adds another thousand words for complaining). Ginger tries to see the good side of Mrs. Grimley by defending her house when the other students egg and TP it. And as it turns out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk">she doesn't have a good side</a> and doesn't even care that her students pulled pranks on her house.

<div class="indent"><strong>Miranda:</strong> That's inhumane! <br/><strong>Courtney:</strong> I don't even <em>know</em> 16,000 words!
</div></li><li> There's also Ginger's high school teacher Mrs. Zorski, who greets Ginger with, "Let me guess, you're an ex-student of Eleanor's. My cousin and I have nothing in common except the last name." Her actions from that point forward could just be considered a bad case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Stern Teacher</a>, but the fact that she doesn't seem to notice or care that she scares Ginger and the other kids to death and stresses them out is a red flag. She calls Ginger a "lazy freshman" and throws her "chicken scratch" homework in the trash right to her face after Ginger accidentally missed her class that morning. Then there was the fact she gave Ginger a full days suspension for sleeping in her class which she only did because she had a caffeine crash which she started just to get through her classes. Worst of all, she showed no sympathy after Ginger was recovering from appendicitis surgery and just told her life doesn't care for her appendix.
</li><li> Carl's middle school science teacher, Mr. Brooks, who was so anxious to set the poor kid up to fail that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">convinced Carl that he had contracted a deadly virus that killed victims within 48 hours from the off-limits lab freezer.</span> There was no such thing, and Lois chews Brooks out over it.

The biology skeleton in her classroom was the skeleton of <em>the last kid to have gotten on her bad side</em>, which leads to AP believing she's actually a supervillain. Long story short, she isn't and it gets her transformed into the evil psychic Queen Mindbender by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, making her one of Atomic Puppet's most dangerous foes.

<ul><li> Inverted with Mr. Van Driessen, the boys' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">overly spiritual</a> social studies teacher, who apparently can't bring himself to discipline anyone and gets steamrolled by their pranks time and time again.
</li><li> Played straight by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a>-turned-teacher Mr. Buzzcut, who is the complete and utter polar opposite of Mr. Van Driessen. He at least cares about the students well-being however as in one episode he ran to the defense of his students, specifically Beavis and Butt-Head themselves no less, to protect them from a guest teacher who was physically attacking them.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Rancid Rabbit and Sally O' Neil from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em> were very cruel teachers to CatDog in the episode "Back to School".
</li><li> Mr. Wilter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChalkZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChalkZone">ChalkZone</a></em>. He'd have to be if he is willing to stunt creativity on the grounds that he hates cartoons.
</li><li> Ms. Shoop, the guidance counselor and recess monitor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Clarence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Clarence">Clarence</a></em>, gets great pleasure from taking away recess, framing students, and taking the fun out of school.
</li><li> In the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em>, Courage develops self-esteem issues that manifest in the form of a Sadist Teacher that immediately starts tormenting the poor dog and criticizing everything he does, and giving him horrible nightmares. It disperses when Courage eventually accepts himself.
</li><li> Mr. Lancer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> both uses this trope straight and subverts it. He had the terrible tendency to pick on the unpopular main character Danny by choosing the popular kids over him, harshly criticizing his schoolwork, and doling out punishments, yet a few episodes have shown he does care for all his students, even Danny.
</li><li> A couple of the teachers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>: Ms. Barch hates all her male students, and gives them terrible grades. The unfairness of this is only slightly mitigated by the fact that often they deserve them. It is not for nothing that she is depicted as Xena the Warrior Princess in the show's closing credits. Mr. Demartino likes to see <em>all</em> his students suffer, but in his case, it's because he feels it's payback for the pain they put him through with their stupidity. However, he greatly fears Ms. Barch (she beats him up in more than one episode and, when given a paintball gun and permission to fire it, she expends an entire magazine on a cowering diMartino. It is revealed the real reason for her hatred of men is all the unresolved issues with her former husband - diMartino reminds her of him).
<ul><li> In fairness, Demartino's students are so ignorant you could understand how they'd drive him off the deep end at times. He also acknowledges the good students and grades them appropriately. (Daria never seems to have problems getting As in his class.) He also takes genuine delight in correct (even if unorthodox) answers, as seen by Quinn giving a correct answer (though with the wrong logic) of what Manifest Destiny is at the end of <em>Is It Fall Yet?</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> had Mr. Bone &amp; Mrs. Wingo in Doug's own nightmarish imagination. Only his imagination though—in reality, they're both actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Stern Teachers</a>, and Mr. Bone actually went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolf</a> for Doug at one point and expelled <em>his own nephew</em> when he caught him bullying Doug.
</li><li> Played straight in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> episode "Nothing to Fear" with Huey Dewey and Louie's hallucination of their teacher Mrs. Quackenbush as a fearsome monster intent on punishing them severely for not doing their homework (when the boys tell her that they actually got it done, the hallucination apologizes and disappears). Subverted in later episodes when the same teacher actually appears in person and is very sweet.
</li><li> Vice Principal Chakal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElTigre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElTigre">El Tigre</a></em> fits this trope. He has it in for Manny and Frida, and enjoys setting harsh punishments for them. However, said students are often troublemaking kids, so you can't really blame him.
</li><li> Mr. Crocker from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>. Besides his fairy-hunting obsession, he also takes a sadistic glee in handing out "F" grades to his students, and his favorite child to torment is none other than Timmy Turner. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, he actually manages to use magic to change reality and make himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">dystopian</a> world. However, this is balanced out by making him one of the show's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkeys</a>.
<ul><li> One episode had a substitute teacher named Mrs. Sunshine who came across as being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTeacher">Cool Teacher</a>... until Timmy wishes her to be a permanent teacher, at which point she reveals she's actually Ms. Doombringer, a <em>terrifyingly</em> competent fairy hunter. As it turns out, she poses as a substitute teacher all the time, attempting to earn her students' trust as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTeacher">Cool Teacher</a>, knowing that if she was made a permanent teacher, it was because one of her students wished for it with their fairy godparent. As soon as the façade drops, she begins torturing her class to try to find out which student has a fairy godparent in an attempt to capture them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>
<ul><li> In the episode "The Finer Strings", Mr. Washee Washee tortures Peter by placing a hot iron onto his skin thinking it'll somehow accelerate his improvement in playing the violin.
</li><li> In "Friends of Peter G.", Stewie mentions that his new daycare teacher deactivates the security camera and beats her students. A few episodes later in "Be Careful What You Fish For", she's depicted as being a cross between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticTeacher">Apathetic Teacher</a> who isn't around to stop the kids from getting injured (or in the case of one unfortunate boy, abducted) and pulled Stewie's arm out of his socket when he protested her not even giving them a proper lunch. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Brian</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">was completely useless</a> to help until it turned out she already had a boyfriend, after which he immediately turned her over to the police.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravedaleHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravedaleHigh">Gravedale High</a></em> generally averted this trope, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman">Max Schneider</a> wasn't the only reasonable teacher at the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGhoulsSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGhoulsSchool">All-Ghouls School</a>, but the trope is played straight in "Goodbye Gravedale", where Schneider is driven away by his class because of a misunderstanding and is briefly replaced by substitute teachers Mr. Gross and Miss Burns, who both prove to be considerably harsher than Schneider. The latter even forced the class to take twelve tests on the same day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> averts this with most teachers on the show, but plays it straight with Lieutenant Major Goose from the episode "New Teacher". He is a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">drill sergeant</a> who, for some reason, decided to be a teacher. Principal Wartz hires him to teach and restore order to Arnold's class after they scare Mr. Simmons away with their bad behavior. Lieutenant Major Goose runs the class like the military. When he sends Curly to the corner for dropping a pencil and Helga and Harold to two of the other corners for laughing, he makes Stinky stand in the remaining corner for no reason other than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">symmetry</a></em>.
<ul><li> Principal Wartz himself has his moments of being cranky, explosively ill-tempered and/or unreasonable, particularly later in the run of the show. It got to the point that it was brought to attention by the characters in the episode "Principal Simmons".
</li></ul></li><li> Spiro Garkos from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hurricanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hurricanes">Hurricanes</a></em> fits this trope as the coach of the Garkos Gorgons Youth Team. He seems to be this to all footballers but Stevie Pepenopolis had it the worst. And he couldn't be reported to Child Welfare because, in the Island of Garkos, he <em>heads</em> the Department of Child Welfare.
</li><li> Ms. Bitters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> is an extreme example. She's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilist</a> who not only hates her students (especially Dib and Zim), but everyone and everything in the world. "Children, your performance was miserable. Your parents will all receive phone calls instructing them to love you less now." However, there's apparently one thing she won't subject her students to: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">the reason for why Valentines Day is now celebrated with meat gifts instead of cards.</a>
<ul><li> One could argue that she is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> and is well aware of how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> it is.
<ul><li> Her design is almost exactly the same as the teacher in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Squee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Squee">Squee!</a></em> (also by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez">Jhonen Vasquez</a>), who's just as sadistic, and intentionally teaches the students wrong information.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also the popular theory that she's not even human, but rather a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that she wasn't hired by the school — <em>they built it around her</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Were it not for the fact that the show is a cartoon and has a number of bizarre moments, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Principal I.M. Greedyguts</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JacobTwoTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JacobTwoTwo">Jacob Two-Two</a></em> would have been fired and sent to jail years ago. Besides always having it out for Jacob (although the latter does frequently ruin his plans), his crimes include appropriating money from the Dreary Meadows and spending it on luxuries for himself, planning to turn said school into a stable for his horses (sending the kids to the sub-basement to learn, but allowing one to come up "once in a while" to rub his feet) and not caring if Jacob, his friend and a fellow teacher are trapped forever in another dimension.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">flashback</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em> revealed Lucius had a teacher who was cruel to him, despite knowing full well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">he was the future ruler of Miseryville</a>. His still-living head is now mounted in Lucius' mansion.
</li><li> Cotton Hill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> describes the principal where he went to military school as, "In my day the principal was the meanest son of a bitch God ever put on one leg, he'd lean on a desk with both hands and swing his leg at you, then when you were standing there shocked the one-legged man would kick you....... he'd bite you!" And it wasn't just him, the whole school was like that. Cotton actually looks back on the experience fondly and is outraged to find out that the school is no longer sadistic (after being sued multiple times). He forcibly takes over the place and becomes a Sadist Teacher himself, reinstating the cruel punishments of his day, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and is driven mad when Bobby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sells</a> every single one</span>.
</li><li> Headmistress from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuchaLucha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuchaLucha">¡Mucha Lucha!</a></em> loves to yell and menace with expulsion, but still has a lighter side that isn't really hidden.
</li><li> In the animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> New Year's special, Charlie Brown's elementary school teacher decides to give the kid <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em> as a reading assignment. <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doorstopper">War And Peace</a>.</strong></em> To a <em>normal elementary school student.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrinch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrinch">Over Christmas break</a> no less. And from the looks of it, he's the only student in the class who was given that assignment.
<ul><li> Not only that, but she gave Charlie Brown a D- despite his best efforts.
<ul><li> Her reasoning was that no kid his age could have possibly read that whole book. She then proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">give him an even longer book</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This was actually an exaggerated version of a storyline that ran in the comic strip, where his teacher assigned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels">Gulliver's Travels</a></em> during Christmas break (not as long, but still <em>way</em> too advanced for grade school) and Charlie Brown didn't help matters by procrastinating.
</li></ul></li><li> Subversion: This is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a> thought of Ms. Keane's fill-in at Pokey Oaks Kindergarten in "Substitute Creature" simply because he was a monster. But the girls learned by the episode's end to not judge a book by its cover.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em>:
<ul><li> Miss Finster is a sadistic playground monitor, especially in season 1. This is only ever when she's inside the school, though. As Spinelli found out, she's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Cool Old Lady</a> when she doesn't have to be an authority figure. It's also implied in several episodes that there's a mutual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemies">Friendly Enemies</a> understanding between the teachers and children, with the former playing the antagonists. "The Library Kid" has her going into a panic when she sees the titular Library Kid in danger on the flagpole - confirming she would never want to see a child get hurt.
</li><li> Dr. Slicer, the replacement principal in the episode "Prickly is Leaving," is so cruel that he horrifies even Miss Finster. He also wants to make the cannon at the front of the school operational and plans to tear down the jungle gym to replace it with a guard tower.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>
<ul><li> Bart's kindergarten teacher. Ohh boy, did Bart have it rough in Kindergarten... Even worse is that her treatment towards Bart happened <em>before</em> he became the brat that he is known as. That's right, <strong>she</strong> is the reason that Bart is the trouble maker that he is today!
<div class="indent"><strong>Class:</strong> <em>(singing)</em> There was a farmer, had a dog, and Bingo was his name-O! <br/><strong>Bart:</strong> B-I-(clap)-(clap)-O! B-I-(clap)-(clap)-O! B-I-(clap)-(clap)-(clap)! And Bingo was his name-O! <br/><strong>Teacher:</strong> <em>[writes on clipboard]</em> Added extra clap; not college material.
</div></li><li> Subverted in "The PTA Disbands!". The teachers go on strike due to Bart's manipulation and a series of substitutes from the townspeople are introduced and quit one by one. Principal Skinner, fed up with the turnover rate, then introduces a thuggish-looking substitute who immediately starts hurling abuse at the terrified students. He's actually just there to introduce Marge, the real substitute.
</li><li> The same man (named Leopold), also appeared in "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" where it appears he's going to be the new principal after Skinner is fired. Again he terrifies the kids only to announce the real new principal is Ned Flanders.
</li><li> There are also teachers (despite their upbeat attitude) that are known penalize students who tattle and moan (even if they're A-students), show no sympathy towards those who cry, and initially pair up students who clearly do not get along at all, causing even more friction in the class. <strong>Audrey McConnell</strong> from the episode "Bart vs. Lisa in Third Grade", is a clear candidate for this trope.
</li><li> In "Black-Eyed, Please", a new teacher, Mrs. Cantwel, takes a liking to everyone in the class except for Lisa, whom Cantwel bullies by giving her below-average grades and taking the paper cutout joeys off the kangaroo-themed "good behavior" board. When Homer and Marge try to get Principal Skinner to do something, the bullying worsens. Later, Edna got the idea of putting Bart in Cantwell's class and when Cantwell leaves to go to the bathroom, Bart brings chaos to the classroom and then he shows her a compromising video of herself in the bathroom cursing Lisa and tells her he posted it online. The plan works in getting Cantwell to leave and before she drives off, the bully teacher confesses the reason for her hatred of Lisa, Mrs. Cantwell thinks that pretty girls like Lisa have it easier than girls like herself.
</li><li> All of these pale in comparison to Jack Lassen, Edna's replacement in "Blazed and Confused", who smokes in school even more frequently than Edna and Hoover, and will not tolerate class clown behaviour at all and gets glee in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">kicking the dog</a> (or in this case, the cat) literally and metaphorically. He even <em>shaved</em> Bart just for attempting to pull a prank. He's so bad he even steals lunch money from the bullies and Bart vows revenge. Finally, when Lassen is publicly embarrassed by Bart, he tries to kill the boy.
</li></ul></li><li> Mr./Mrs. Garrison of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> sometimes slips into this trope, openly mocking his students if they get some question wrong. The rest of the time he's either just plain incompetent or trying to get the school to fire him so he can sue them as part of a get-rich-quick-scheme, not caring about the mental damage he might inflict on the children in the process through his lewd teachings. It doesn't help that most of the time, he's not even teaching an actual school curriculum, and instead focuses mostly on assorted pop culture gibberish. When Mrs. Garrison blew off teaching to go drink at a lesbian bar, she hired a group of illegal immigrants to do her job for her, and <em>they did it better than she does</em>.
<ul><li> This goes even further in the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E14TheDeathCampOfTolerance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS6E14TheDeathCampOfTolerance">The Death Camp of Tolerance</a>, where Mr. Garrison hires a masochistic leatherman named Mr. Slave as the teacher's assistant, who would eventually become his boyfriend up until season 9, thus becoming a <em>literal</em> sadist teacher.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> episode "Mad Mod" took this to extremes, in which Mad Mod traps the heroes in a school that's constantly trying to kill or brainwash them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> had Granny, of all people, depicted this way in the first segment of the episode "Best O' Plucky Duck Day". She punishes every student who answers her questions incorrectly by making them do 8,000-15,000 page essays over the weekends.
</li><li> Mrs. Martin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WatchMyChops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WatchMyChops">Watch My Chops</a></em> punishes Bernie and Corneil all the time even when Bernie is not in school nor when school is open. It should be noted that Martin is breaking the law as this is illegal to punish children outside of school. Once, she punished Romeo for no reason. This is also illegal.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoonShow">What A Cartoon! Show</a></em> short "Trevor in Journey to Sector 5-G" has Trevor's teacher Mr. Fitzgibbon. He actively torments his students by giving them deliberately hard math problems and withholding recess until his students answer the problem correctly.
</li><li> Principal Madman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhateverHappenedToRobotJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhateverHappenedToRobotJones">Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?</a></em> is hard on all his students, but especially Robot, since he's also a technophobe.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder20');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder20" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> For centuries teachers were allowed to "discipline" children by beating them in class for "bad behaviour". Since the 1980s and 1990s, these practices have mostly become illegal in Western countries.
<ul><li> Especially in Great Britain teachers and headmasters had a long tradition of beating and mentally abusing pupils with canes. Corporal punishment in British government-run schools was made illegal in 1987, and all schools in 2003.
</li></ul></li><li> Attached to above, it's something of a common trope for teaching nuns in Catholic schools to be stereotypes as always smacking their students on the back of the hand with a ruler.
</li><li> This trope is sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> as a reason for homeschooling, though given that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> incidents tend to be a few highly publicized but isolated cases it's usually an excuse for parents who have other reasons, like religious or political beliefs, that they don't want to discuss.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> based the teacher Wackford Squeers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NicholasNickleby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NicholasNickleby">Nicholas Nickleby</a></em> on a notorious sadistic teacher called William Shaw.
</li><li> Writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a> describes in his memoir "Boy" how his teachers often beat the children with a cane and choose the thinnest ones to inflict more pain. He describes one particular teacher, Mr. Hardcastle, as particularly heartless (even forcing a child who was stung on his lip by a wasp to continue writing, <em>as he didn't use his lip for writing, did he?</em>) and focused on punishing even the slightest breaking of the rules. The teacher later inspired the character Captain Lancaster in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DannyTheChampionOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DannyTheChampionOfTheWorld">Danny, the Champion of the World</a></em>, Mrs. Trunchbull in "Matilda" is also inspired by his teachers' abuse of their pupils. The latter was also inspired by a teacher of his daughter's - who caught Liccy and her friend sneaking ice cream during the night and made them stand at the wall until all the ice cream melted in their hands.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://archive.fo/TcfZG">The 6 Most Horrific Lessons Ever Taught in Elementary School<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> brought to you by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em>. It's possible that the teachers involved didn't torment their students out of sadism but out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">genuine belief that they were doing the right thing.</a> That arguably makes it <em>worse</em>.
</li></ul><ul><li> There was once a minor scandal in Poland about one <a class="urllink" href="http://www.edukacjawpolsce.pl/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=202">batshit crazy teacher<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. She made her students (seven-year-old children!) sit with hands tied behind their backs (for "better concentration") and, judging from videos recorded by a student with a cell-phone, was also an utter insane bitch whose lessons consisted mainly of screaming at the top of her lungs. However, her main claim to infamy was her utter, terrifying ignorance. She taught students that whales are fishes, Christopher Columbus was a Polish scientist who made a trip around Earth, "szalik" (scarf) is a five-letter word...
</li><li> As seen on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">Can't Get Away with Nuthin'</a> page, one teacher <em>called the police</em> on a girl for drawing on her desk in <em>washable ink.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>, much?
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> as far along as the university level; professors who hate teaching undergraduate students. Some take it out on them in the course load and grades assigned, some indulge in verbal abuse to unprofessional degrees, and seize any opportunity to belittle their students publicly. A few times, a teacher/professor even uses their position as a bully pulpit to essentially indoctrinate their students with viewpoints that only tangentially have any bearing on the subject, and sometimes even makes it a point to arrange it in regards to people providing proof to back their claims on history that they have to find proof at short notice (between class sessions), with no definitively confirmed method of disproving them by the next class.
<ul><li> Averted in many countries with compulsory civil service, such as Finland or Israel, where people usually go through military service and sometimes have worked and/or traveled before beginning their studies; its a lot harder to look down upon a fellow adult than it is upon someone whos practically a teenager.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1383687/Osama-Bin-Laden-dead-Texas-teacher-suspended-mocking-Muslim-girl.html">There was<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a supreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> teacher in Texas who told one of his Muslim students, "I'll bet you're grieving. I heard about your uncle's death." shortly after Bin Laden was killed.
</li><li> As mentioned under Literature, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a>'s first boarding school was run by a headmaster named Robert "Oldie" Capron who was a <em>literal</em> sadist, and who was eventually committed to an insane asylum.
</li></ul><ul><li> Many schools nowadays, especially high schools, have security guards. The problem is many teachers take advantage of this and call security on a student for the most minor of infractions. The irony of this is that calling security causes a much bigger distraction to class than a student who's slightly misbehaving.
</li><li> Practically every single doctor on Earth can speak of dealing with one of these at some point in their training—medical school or residency. Most of whom will justify their behavior by claiming that they themselves had to deal with one of these, as well as the fact that given that human lives are at stake, it's understandable that there would be such strict demands for perfection and zero tolerance for mistakes.
</li><li> Possibly justified during the World War II years. People in certain occupations did not have to report to Basic Training for the Draft. Teaching was one of these occupations, and since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>, all sorts of people, even people who hated children, got into teaching jobs. After several years, the war ended, but the child-haters were still teaching. They couldn't leave, lest they attract suspicion that they were draft-dodgers, so they took their anger out on the hapless children.
<ul><li> Due to the massive lack of adults in post-Nazi Germany in general, plenty of Nazis ended up in the education sector who continued to use their militaristic, cruel teaching on students. Special mention to the few known cases of Nazi teachers having to teach French/English, but instead opted to teach about "the enemy", occasionally going so far to teach the students the language in written form only, with harsh punishments for any student that spoke in it or challenged them.
</li></ul></li><li> Mostly subverted with Drill Sergeants in the military. Most of them aren't seeking to destroy the recruits, but instead to mold them into professional soldiers/marines/sailors/airmen by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> behavior to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass">Dare to Be Badass</a>. However, you will sometimes find those DIs who are <em>actually</em> abusive towards the recruits, usually by either doling out excessive punishments or by training them in an unsafe manner.
</li><li> In early 2016, some secretly-recorded footage <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/nyregion/success-academy-teacher-rips-up-student-paper.html?_r=0">emerged<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of a teacher at a charter school in New York City ripping up a first-grader's homework paper and berating her for answering a question incorrectly.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> based on Severus Snape, Harry Potter's bete noire, on a sadistic chemistry teacher of hers.
</li><li> Ireland after getting independence in the 20th century was heavily controlled by the Catholic Church, whose effects in schools were still being felt as late as the 90s. A 2018 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.galwaydaily.com/news/twitter-user-gets-deluge-church-stories/">Twitter thread<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> went viral with plenty sharing their stories of abuse in Catholic schools.
</li><li> Actress Constance Wu recalled a story of a teacher that accused her of plagiarism on an assignment she worked very hard on. The teacher attempted to try and prove she had cheated, stating "this is too good to have been done by you". When she couldn't find proof, the teacher dragged Constance to each of her other teachers to ask them if they thought she was good enough to have written it. Each of them said no except, heartwarmingly enough, her drama teacher.
