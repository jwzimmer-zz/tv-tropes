To the public, including his family, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">The Paragon</a>, a handsome, stoic, and supremely confident warrior that has never been beaten in a fight. However, this is just a facade that he projects to everyone; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask">Beneath the Mask</a>, Katakuri is just as gluttonous and goofy as his siblings and is deeply insecure about his imperfections — particularly his grotesque, "pelican eel" mouth. The thing is, while he was bullied for it, he didn't really care since he could always beat up his bullies if they gave him flak. However, it was after his little sister, Brulee, was attacked and scarred by said bullies' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">Revenge by Proxy</a> that he started becoming the way he is, vowing never to slip up and let any of his siblings be hurt again. He is devoted to maintaining the charade as much as possible and only allows himself to forget the pressures of being the "perfect" brother and son during his daily "snack time", which he spends in isolation. He's even willing to <em>kill</em> to keep up the illusion, as seen when he killed a number of chefs who accidentally saw him during his snack time. It's only during his fight with Luffy, an opponent who has seen his physical and personality flaws and cared nothing for them, that Katakuri is finally inspired to break out of this mindset for the sake of fighting a truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a></span>.
</li><li> The Whole Cake Island arc also explores this with the Four Emperors. What hasn't really been touched upon in the story until this arc is that the Emperors play a political game as much as they do a power one. Much like the World Government, the Emperors rely on their reputation to keep their respective empires in the New World, but whereas the World Government presents itself as competent and just, the Emperors present themselves as powerful and feared. They do this by killing or (usually forcibly) recruiting any that challenge them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is because of this that the Big Mom Pirates so desperately chase after the Straw Hats and the Firetanks in the latter half of the arc, instead of just cutting their losses after the two groups managed to escape them the first time. It was already bad enough that they screwed up the Charlotte Family's plan to murder the Vinsmokes, and then attempted to assassinate Big Mom themselves, but if they were to <em>escape</em> without facing suitable retribution, it would almost irreversibly damage the name of Big Mom and open up the crew and their territories to attacks from the other Emperors or even the Marines (who notoriously refuse to challenge <em>any</em> Emperor seriously unless it's on their terms). It's why they muster all the forces they can just to capture Luffy at Cacao Island — as embarrassing as it is to send so many against one man, him escaping would be <em>worse</em>, no matter how minuscule a chance it may be. And when they finally do escape almost unscathed after a lot of damage done, the main reason they don't take a giant hit to their reputation is that the whole mess was so outrageous it instead massively improved Luffy's own, to the point he's thought to be in the same bracket as the Emperors now (much to Big Mom's displeasure)</span>.

(Spectrem: "Look, guys, it's not that we aren't pleased you helped free the inn. We are! And we really like that you're concerned about the people. But, you know, you always gotta take lotsa little things into account before you do something. And the Guardians' rep is not all that little.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This played a major part in the doping scandal. After the story broke thanks to a leak in the ISU, Viktor's immediate reaction had been to speed over to Yuuri and apologize and beg for forgiveness on bent knee; Yakov stopped him and forced him into a press conference to apologize for the accusations publicly, as the longer he put it off the more damage would be done to both his <em>and</em> Yuuri's reputations, and thus, their careers. The fact that this all happened in Yuuri's <em>home country</em>, causing him to lose the biggest competition of his career, made things infinitely worse. Just about the only thing stopping Viktor's reputation from going down in flames was his obvious distress over the situation, seen in his own performance at the competition, which he bombed even worse than Yuuri did, culminating in him running after Yuuri when it was over, clearly heartbroken and desiring to make amends (all of which was televised for the entire world to see). The entire Russian skating team faced backlash for what happened, forcing them to leg it out of Japan as soon as the competition was over, and they didn't face much sympathy anywhere else in the skating world for the following nine months (barring, of course, Russia).

<ul><li> It should be noted that his fearsome act was more for his crew's benefit than his actual reputation. He wanted to be a high-class villain, showing mercy to Tristan while still doing a pirate's work, but his crew were more stereotypical and so maintained a rough-and-tumble attitude outside his quarters.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, the Parahuman Response Team (PRT), the agency in charge of the government superhero teams, is extremely concerned about the image that the heroes show to the public. The steps they take for good PR include things such as ordering heroes to attend charity events, giving assistance to media that portrays powers in a positive light, and classifying information about a given hero's power if the full details would be something the general public finds disturbing. <a class="urllink" href="http://parahumans.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/drone-23-1/">Chapter 23.1<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> introduces Glenn Chambers, head of Image.
<div class="indent"><strong>Hoyden:</strong> All Glenn cares about is the image, the PR. Up to you to figure out how to hold yourself like a 'lady' while you're dealing with street thugs with guns.
</div><ul><li> Multiple layers of PR slavery as it turns out: Glenn himself is not stupid, he just knows that if anybody is going to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">expose the corruption in the PRT</span>, they'll need public support. Which incidentally is something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingHero">Taylor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">has</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">trouble</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuelStationAttendant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuelStationAttendant">with</a>.
</li><li> Played With when it comes to the villains. They must maintain a reputation of being formidable, so their underlings respect them and their enemies think twice about attacking them. The Undersiders, for example, do a lot what they do to maintain their Rep. But villains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">can't have too nasty a reputation</a>, lest they cross <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">the fine line between "intimidating" and "dangerous"</a>. Groups like the Slaughterhouse Nine, for instance, have gone so far over that line that heroes and villains will team up to deal with them when they come to town, and anyone who manages to kill one of them are simply thanked for their service by the PRT. In short, being a villain is a balancing act between this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a>, with slip-ups having potentially disastrous results.
</li><li> The PRT was concerned about image because it wanted parahumans to be integrated into regular society, and thought that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> against people with powers would lead to civil unrest and riots with superpowers that would tear apart society. Worm's sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward">Ward</a></em>, which is set after the collapse of the PRT, shows that these fears were well-grounded. Without the PRT, anti-parahuman sentiment is on the rise, with the protagonists' efforts to keep Earth Gimel safe being hampered by an increasing reluctance by civilians to cooperate with heroes.

To a lesser degree, every citizen has a score based on their social media presence, which influences whether they can secure loans and employment.
</li><li> Brightlord Amaram in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em> is widely considered across Alethkar to be the perfect model of an honorable, disciplined noble general. After Kaladin accuses him of a serious crime, Adolin believes him after pointing out that a) Kaladin stepped in during a duel to save Adolin's life, when Amaram stepped back and said that infighting would only cause chaos, and b) another man famed for his honor, Adolin's father, has a blemished record, making Amaram's pristine reputation suspiciously clean. Adolin concludes that Amaram isn't truly honorable, he just spends a lot of time cleaning up his reputation.
<ul><li> The crime in question? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaladin was a commoner soldier in his army who saved Amaram's life by killing a Shardbearer. Anyone who kills a Shardbearer is allowed to claim their priceless Shardblade, no matter their origins. Amaram instead took the Shardblade, set up false witnesses, and killed everyone else involved except for Kaladin, whom he sold into slavery. Amaram's justification was that a Shardblade would be wasted on a commoner who didn't know how to use a sword</span>.

Another episode, "Whine Whine Whine", involves Superman being sued for slightly injuring a man whose life he saved.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>: A very common trope for this show. The protagonists work for the Department of the Navy and although they are primarily concerned with the proper functioning of the military justice system, the overall PR and public opinion ramifications are never far away from their minds or actions. The news media, congressional people or other groups often play up various incidents. PR considerations are often hinted at by superiors (usually the SECNAV) and are often talked about behind closed doors (to avoid the appearance of unlawful command influence).

His clients are primarily celebrities who for various PR reasons cannot go to the hospital and Dr. Rush makes house calls and is extremely discreet. A movie producer does not want the tabloids to know that he broke his penis while having sex so he offers Rush $40,000 to treat him.

</li><li> One episode in season 4 involves an actor shadowing Danny in preparation for a role in a movie. When said actor gets himself stabbed in a fight, he doesn't want the public finding out so Danny has to drive him to a secret clinic rather than call an ambulance for him.

Admitting any fault is political (and, possibly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">actual</a>) suicide. Passing the buck is the normal way of doing things. This leads to numerous problems for the main characters, who are trying to stop a major disaster from getting even worse. In one case, Moscow spends months negotiating with West Germany for a robot that can withstand the official radiation level at Chernobyl (2000 roentgen). In fact, the real level is six times that amount, and the robot shuts down within <em>seconds</em>, as no amount of shielding can protect the circuitry of anything more complicated than a light switch from such amounts of radiation. Scherbina loses it and curses out top party officials on a phone line he knows is being monitored by the KGB. As revealed during the trial, the two officials in charge of the power plant are only about promotions, so falsifying test results and avoiding looking bad are their top priorities. The same applies to Dyatlov, who browbeats his subordinates into causing the dangerous situation, also hoping for a promotion. Finally, Legasov accuses the entire Soviet state of this, revealing that a flaw had been discovered in RBMK reactor design that would result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailsafeFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailsafeFailure">Failsafe Failure</a> if SCRAM was ever initiated during a runaway reaction, only to be suppressed by the government as it would make them look bad.

<ul><li> This was one of the biggest flaws of Victor Steiner-Davion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>. At the age of 22, he became ruler of the Federated Commonwealth in 3052 after his father, Hanse Davion, died of a heart attack. He really wasn't up to the task and was <em>far</em> too prone to basing his decisions on what to do based on whether or not it was something his subjects would perceive as the "good" thing rather than what was a smart long-term decision. The largest one was when his sister, Kathrine, stole half his realm in 3057. Everyone in the Inner Sphere expected him to immediately try to retake it, but wanting to play peacemaker he let her keep it. This led to her mismanaging that side of the realm for several years, then in 3060, after he returned from fighting the Clans to protect the entire Inner Sphere, he discovered that she'd gone and stolen the other half of the FedCom. Every single soldier in the international coalition he'd commanded immediately pledged their support in going to get his realm back, even the soldiers from the Capellan Confederation, the FedCom's most hated foe. Victor again refused, backing down because he was so concerned about potentially being seen as a warmonger (despite the fact that he already knew that Kathrine had also arranged for the assassination of their mother). Unfortunately, leaving Kathrine on the throne turned out to be a disaster as she was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">ambitious but incompetent ruler</a> who's hamfisted policies of lashing out at anyone she perceived as not showing sufficient respect to her resulted in tensions boiling over until open issurection began on multiple planets, which <em>finally</em> motivated Victor to act against her in the FedCom Civil War.
</li><li> Gaming fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> refer to this as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupidChaoticStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupidChaoticStupid">"Lawful Stupid" and "Chaotic Stupid"</a> when one's alignment rules <em>force</em> them to do something obviously detrimental. This often depends on one's interpretation of the various behavior codes.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook">Sourcebook</a> <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em>, based around the Good alignments, devotes sections of its first chapter to <em>avoiding</em> the Lawful Stupid trap. The first lesson: when the villagers tell you "A dragon is attacking us!" it does not ding your alignment to ask, "How big and does it have friends?"
<ul><li> However, the book also establishes that performing an evil act to save a lot of innocent lives is still ultimately a victory for evil and that a hero may end up in a situation where they can't avoid doing an evil act. But since good and evil are actual forces in DnD, this makes sense. And the book stresses that the forces of good are forgiving, though heroes must pay a price to make up for what they did.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Paladins (the character class) in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">tabletop roleplaying game</a> <em>must</em> be Lawful Good and follow their chivalric codex of tirelessly slaying evil, upholding good, protecting the innocents... lest they fall from grace and lose all their abilities. Some dungeon masters take this to vindictive extremes, punishing the character (and by proxy the player) for even the slightest transgression. (The worst variety of DMs deliberately engineer no-win situations where the Paladin is practically <em>forced</em> to break their code.)
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">Sometimes not even a transgression.</a> You can fall for evil deeds performed <em>inadvertently</em> (this can technically include furthering a villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>), evil deeds performed while being mind controlled and evil deeds performed by <em>other members of the party</em>, though most non-vindictive DMs will allow for a little leeway in this regard. And paladins <em>do</em> options for atoning for whatever evil deeds caused them to fall, thus regaining their powers.
</li><li> Conversely, blackguards must be evil.
<ul><li> Blackguards and Paladins have it easy compared to the variant Paladin of Slaughter, who must be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a>. You must disrespect all authority figures that haven't proven their physical superiority to you, refuse help to those in need and sow destruction and death at all opportunities. All opportunities. It seems quite likely that if this paladin is ever given the watch for the night, someone will die. Horribly.
</li><li> The Paladin of Slaughter is also forbidden to associate with anyone who's not of Evil alignment, and forbidden to have henchmen, followers, and cohorts of <em>any</em> alignment other than Chaotic Evil. That's right, the <em>Chaotic Evil</em> paladin variant has the strictest rules about who they can work with. Somebody seems to have forgotten what "chaotic" means.
</li><li> And don't even begin to think about what it means to be a Paladin of Freedom. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a>. You must disrespect authority and sow <em>freedom</em> at all opportunities. Good luck figuring out what that actually means. This is especially difficult to understand given that an earlier book had contained the Holy Liberator, who was very similar in nature to the Paladin of Freedom except that the code of conduct was basically "Help people and fight evil, and beyond that it's silly to try to give a strict code to a chaotic class."
</li></ul></li><li> Fourth Edition changed this, so now there is a single Paladin class who can be any alignment, but the alignment must be the same as the god the Paladin dedicates himself to. They retain their powers no matter what<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1dn64');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1dn64" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1dn64');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">How long it'll be before that gets changed is anyone's guess, given that the idea of a fallen paladin was in the past central to the class.</span>, but if a Paladin strays too far from his god's tenets, his compatriots will hunt him down and drag him back to be judged by that god's followers.
</li><li> Fifth Edition throws it all out. Paladins no longer have an alignment restriction of any kind (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">though they're still written as if Lawful Good</a>) and instead have a Sacred Oath that they take at third level that provides them with part of their powers and spells and also gives a loose code of conduct. A paladin who repeatedly breaks their oath might become an Oathbreaker, but there's a lot more wiggle room on behavior.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> plays around with this trope a lot, on all sides of the equation. The main protagonists, the Solar Exalted along with the Lunar Exalted, are both hailed as "Anathema" by two thousand years of propaganda, which is one of the main obstacles in their work to save Creation. Of course, once they grow powerful enough they can simply <em>make</em> people love them anyway. That goes for pretty much everything in the setting except mortals, actually.
<ul><li> The most infamous example would be the First Age Solar Desus, who personally invented a Charm that made everyone see him in the best light. Whatever he did, it was Good, and if it wasn't Good, it was <em>for</em> the <em>Greater Good</em>, and he's an even bigger hero for taking up that burden. It says a lot that general consensus is that he was one of the <em>lesser</em> monsters amongst the First Age Solars. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note206ji');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note206ji" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note206ji');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although the fact that he was as affected by the charm as everyone else, and also had a condition that led to him to act with deliberate cruelty when stressed, mean we're in the realm of 'not in his right mind' mode. Some of the other Solars didn't have that kind of excuse.</span>

However, we don't want examples; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">it would only be asking for trouble</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">and more importantly</a>, we don't want this section to be larger than the rest of the wiki.
<ul><li> A common problem with wars throughout history, but especially a problem in the modern era. The 24-hour news cycle combined with the phenomenon of Internet social media has made the public backlash to war more important than ever because the means by which war and its architects can be criticized with modern technology is greater than ever before in human history. If a war is deemed too costly to continue, too immoral, or if it was done for the wrong reasons — the public will let you know so fast that your head will spin.
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek">Nonviolent Resistance</a> and protests work today in the modern era thanks to the press being widely available where it's most important for governments and other organizations to protect their image and reputation.
<ul><li> This is sometimes exploited by foes of the movement, who may place agents of their own in a crowd of protestors in order to incite violence. This tarnishes the group's reputation and serves as justification for harsh crackdowns and mass arrests against them.
</li></ul></li><li> This is actually what the concept of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor">honor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> used to mean, and what it still means in many cultures. Being "honorable" meant that one had a reputation for trustworthiness, reliability, and fair treatment of others, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">even if others might see it as putting yourself at a disadvantage</a>.
