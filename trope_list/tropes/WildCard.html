They truly aren't interested in consistently remaining with either side, and will very often simply want both to leave them alone. They can be the sort of person who will stay out of things entirely, until someone else (usually the hero or other sympathetic character) asks them for help.
</p><p>The Wild Card doesn't care whose toes they stomp on, even if they're supposed to be the Wild Card's own team. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> probably got one (if they even manage to convince one) onto the team <em>only</em> because the Wild Card <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife">owes them big time</a>. The Wild Card can really shake up a team—the more suspicious characters will quite rightly not trust them.
</p><p>Unlike the mainstream neutral characters that don't join evil or good because of their preference of not assisting malevolent individuals accidentally, which they have a right to fear, Wild Card characters are instead dynamic in terms of their morality, which doesn't exactly make them truly impartial. The latter characters however, are truly impartial and rather morally static, meaning they stay loyal to what their overall morality is.

</li></ul><p>Sometimes Wild Cards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">fall</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyMatrimony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyMatrimony">in love</a>. Love is the bane of the Wild Card, because no longer does the world revolve around one amazing and easy to understand person—there's somebody else. Oh my god, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisFeeling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisFeeling">What Is This Feeling?</a>! Knowing how erratic the Wild Card can be, it could be somebody from either team—or both. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">somebody to care about</a>, the Wild Card may well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">become</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">more reliable</a> for a team. Or if there's multiple people to care about, they may become <em>less</em> reliable. There are also some Wild Cards who became what they are <em>because</em> they fell in love with someone.
</p><p>Neutral characters of the said three neutrality alignments can qualify as this (with Chaotic Neutral being more notorious with this trope, but because neutrality is by definition not joining either side, this is by no means a guarantee). Basically there are some neutral characters of the three impartial alignments that are deemed Wild Cards, while some others are not.
</p><p>Wild Cards are very rarely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a>, though; they aren't really <em>dedicated</em> enough to evil—or to <em>anything</em>—to be <em>that</em> evil. However much they may enjoy doing what they do, most Wild Cards have either some form of morality, or high survival instincts, and are likely to turn on their evil employer because they were betrayed, don't want to be blown up with the planet, or even just because they just don't like being <em>that</em> evil. Wild Cards are more likely to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s poor choice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy">Bastard Understudy</a>, or even the Good Team's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Token Evil Teammate</a>.
</p><p>While the average Wild Card sees their "friends" as a handy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofHumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofHumanShield">Bulletproof Human Shield</a>, they have just enough conscience to feel bad about abandoning them when the fight turns ugly. No Wild Card switches teams because they <em>care</em> about their friends—they switch teams because it means a better life for them.
</p><p>On rare occasions, a Wild Card may unexpectedly pull a sudden act of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, though it'll likely be because they guessed that if they didn't sacrifice themselves, they'd probably die anyway—along with everybody else.
</p><p>Or they might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">not</a>. Wild Cards are just <em>that</em> unreliable.
</p><p>Not to be confused with the <em>Wild Cards</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards">book series</a>. Also not to be confused with wild card sports teams, which are teams who qualify for the postseason despite not winning their division, usually being added in order to fill out what would otherwise be empty playoff brackets.

Even though it's a game, Sora strives to survive at all costs; he only helps either side if there's an immediate tangible benefit to him, and isn't above playing both sides at once, although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this ultimately costs him badly when he pulls one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">Back Stab</a> too many, fulfilling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a> aspect</span>.

He will kill criminals, initiate crime wars, recruit gangsters (only to betray them at the right moment), resort to torture to get information (or just because he feels like it), and so on and so forth. It is all part of his vendetta against crime and vision of a better world. Or something like that. While he does truly think he's doing some good for Gotham, his actions sometimes cause innocents to be casualties. He (tries) to kill whoever gets in his way, even his former mentor and foster parent (Batman) along with his "siblings" (the other Robins). Sometimes it isn't even just about them being in his way but him just feeling competitive. It is hard to classify him as hero or villain, but it's clear he is not someone to be messed with.

The problem is, most and with only a few exceptions — even most <em>villains</em> — want almost nothing to do with him, and rightly so. Because when you're a bad guy, but you have a choice of working with other bad guys, you don't want the one who may just try to kill you for no other reason than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">because he thought it would be funny</a>. However, it's a completely different situation if the Joker <em>comes to <strong>you</strong></em>. Because it's not like he's the type to take "no" for an answer. And he might be a harmless prankster one minute, and then decide to be a back-stabbing, murderous psychopath the next. This is a big reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">he's feared even by supervillains far more powerful than he</a>.
<ul><li> Funnily enough this tendency of The Joker is precisely why Lex Luthor always tries to include him in large supervillain team-ups whenever possible. If you have a large group of villains getting together and <em>don't</em> invite the Joker, he's liable to wreck your plans anyway because he feels like he's been snubbed. There's no way for the Joker to <em>not</em> be a Wild Card, so Luthor has found it safest to just include him in his plans in some capacity and at least try to get him to cooperate. The alternative is leaving him out and praying he doesn't invite himself to the party.

Although one central part of his character is that he is both Harvey Dent and Two-Face, so anyone savvy enough (Gordon or Batman) is able to exploit that by forcing a confrontation between Two-Face and Dent.

He shanghais the heroes to escape from some rivals' plots (Of course, his part in the prophecies didn't help matters either), manages to trick the leader of the Dagashi (ninja-like assassins) to the point that even said leader is impressed with his cleverness, and then near the end, represents his government (despite at that time having no legal standing whatsoever) in a set of very lucrative accords, and uses his standing in the accords to buy himself back into his queen's good graces.

He believes that what he is doing is no different than the many acts he has previously performed as a loyal spy, acting to preserve the long-term stability of Alera. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the later books, he turns again upon realizing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> is the heir to the throne and would make a far better ruler than Aquitaine</span>.

She might count as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> Wild Card, given that she is loyal above all to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> but not necessarily the current emperor or empress on the throne.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">House</a> she is associated with, the Dzur, is also something of a Wild Card group, as Sethra notes in the book <em>Dzur</em> how that group likes fighting for its own sake and will choose the right side when everyone else is against it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> plays with this. Harry is generally perceived as this by a large part of the supernatural community, but Murphy points out that he's quite predictable once you know him. He's a guaranteed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a> for the plans of everyone in the immediate area, but if he agrees with the morality of what you're doing he'll help you out.

To this end she drags several acquaintances through the portal with her, knowing that <em>they</em> will also be Wild Cards that she can control better than her enemies can. That being said, they become savvier as the series goes on, and pretty soon they're messing up her plans as well.
</li><li> Walter Baranov the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> of the mystery novel <em>The False Inspector Dew</em> qualifies as one of these in terms of his actions, particularly because the novel never conveys his mental state to the reader, making his true nature ambiguous. Walter had planned on killing his nagging wife on board a ship, but when she doesn't show and another corpse turns up, he has to impersonate a famous detective on account of using that detective's name as a pseudonym, and solves the murder. The ending implies that he will very soon be trying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectCrime">The Perfect Crime</a> again, this time successfully.
</li><li> Josip from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlightToTheLonesomePlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlightToTheLonesomePlace">Flight to the Lonesome Place</a></em> only wants the reward for finding the Blue Boy, not realizing that the reward was put in place so that Ronnie would have a harder time escaping those who want to kill him.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>, Jarlaxle is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> Wild Card. One excellent example of his playing both sides <em>and</em> the middle is when he captured a young woman, made a half-hearted attempt at seducing her, and set things up so his own ally would "betray" him and free her, so they could go rescue her would-be boyfriend and the ally's rival, who was being held by Jarlaxle's employer. Ta-daaa.

</li></ul><ul><li> Eddie Malone from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Leviathan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Leviathan">Leviathan</a></em> is an American reporter with no loyalty to either the Clanker or Darwinist side and a knack for finding things out. While he personally likes the protagonists and can be very helpful at times, his first concern is <em>always</em> having something to turn in to his editors.
</li><li> Zack State, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMentalState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMentalState">The Mental State</a></em>, definitely qualifies. He is a sociopath with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">talent for manipulation</a> and a fondness for devious schemes. It is almost impossible to tell what his objective is at any one time. He normally only reveals what his plans were after they have been completed. He comfortably worms his way into other people's confidences, sets two sides against each other and takes full advantage of any opportunity that comes his way.
</li><li> The Marquis de Carabas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a></em>. He's your man right up until there's more in it for him not to be.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">Vergere</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">New Jedi Order</a></em> series. <em>What</em> she was doing was pretty clear (training Jacen Solo to be an uber-Force user) but the <em>why</em> was so ambiguous that even the editors can't seem to decide. At first the official position was that she wanted peace but wasn't allied with any faction in particular, then that she was a loyal (albeit unorthodox) Jedi of the Old Republic, and now she's apparently supposed to be a Sith acolyte. Thing is, the original Vergere was just such a messed-up enigma that the authors seem to dust her off whenever they need someone to act as the linchpin of the ongoing plot, giving a sort of weird meta-status as the Wild Card.
<ul><li> Talon Karrde as well, although at least he's honourable enough not to sell anyone out if he can help it. He even lampshades it at one point, telling a Republic officer that he's in it for the money, not the ideology. The reason he sides mostly with the good-guys? He reckons they're going to win in the end.
</li><li> Heck, his ship is even called The Wild Karrde!

Varys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">actually mentions</a> more than once that his big talent in life is sucking up to whoever is in power. Both come from very humble backgrounds for the circles they operate in (the littlest of Lordlings for Littlefinger, foreign eunuch for Varys) but through raw talent became Councilors and major players in the realm, and both are aware of how they have to secure themselves at all costs. Particularly Varys, who despite decades as a major player has <em>no title or wealth whatsoever of his own</em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Sellswords</a> are generally on the side of getting paid by somebody whose money is good for at least the next week — preferably, month. With very few exceptions. They may, however, change sides if you wave a better possible payout for less danger in front of their noses... unless they're with the Golden Company and are sticking to their contract. Or, like the independent contractor known as Bronn, they have taken the Golden Company as the standard by which to be measured. However, then you get the ones like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivalOfKillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivalOfKillers">The Brave Companions</a>": <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a> rules.

He is sort of possessed by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> (Mordeth) who became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">pure evil to ward his city from an other evil</a> two millennia ago. But, as it turns out, he (Padan Fain) was working for the main villain before that, and now his only goal is to screw with both teams by killing the hero and making sure no one else does before him. Note that unlike many Wild Cards, Fain <em>is</em> unabashedly evil — it's just that his goals put him at odds in various ways with almost every major faction in the series.
</li><li> Gary Karkofsky a.k.a Merciless: The Supervillain without Mercy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSupervillainySaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSupervillainySaga">The Supervillainy Saga</a></em> certainly qualifies. Not only is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antivillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antivillain">Antivillain</a>, he's also got many friends on both sides of the superhero/supervillain divide.

<ul><li> Jack also played with it, "going rogue" as a result of the fact that the country wasn't exactly happy with him in the first place, but he still always had the country's best interests in mind and was merely playing the bad guys.

The first is, as an intelligence agent of the United States, to secure and defend America's military, diplomatic, and industrial interests abroad. The second, and more important, is as a father: to keep his daughter—also an intelligence agent—safe. Because of the dangerous nature of his daughter's missions, these two goals come into conflict more often than might be thought.

So there you go. He certainly does his best to muck up Admiral Adama's command while recruiting groupies wherever he goes; first he tries to seize power politically, but when that plan goes bust, he embraces the mantle of the 'martyr', founding a sect of monotheists (a novelty in the Twelve Colonies, which are devoutly <em>poly</em>theistic) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionPlay">running afoul of some Romans</a>, i.e. President Roslin.

While he still has moral lines that he won't cross in terms of gratuitous murder, he's extremely unpredictable and untrustworthy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>'s Jayne Cobb appears to be this type of character, but when his one attempted betrayal is weighed against all the instances where he unhesitatingly stands by the crew against overwhelming odds he suddenly looks far less neutral. This may be because the one time he tried to betray the crew, Mal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">damn near threw him out the airlock</span>.

</li><li> William Bell's true allegiances are never really clear. On one occasion, he's fighting against Walternate and helping Olivia, on the other, he's the very man who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">created the shapeshifters</span>. He's also behind some of the show's more... <em>morally questionable</em> acts.
</li><li> Next, we have Sam Weiss. On one hand, he's very friendly, helps rehabilitate Olivia and makes a new friend in the process. On the other hand, Walternate is somehow aware of his existance and doesn't trust him, he appears to be the author behind the century-old book <em>The First People</em>, and knows exactly who Peter Bishop is and what his connection to the Wake Sink Device is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually, we learn that he was just an ordinary guy all along who happened to have generations of knowledge bestowed upon him</span>.
</li><li> The show's biggest wild card is arguably <strong>The Man In The X T-Shirt</strong>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Olivia has absolutely no memories of the man despite the fact that he was in her mind. Even more creepy is that he <em>wasn't</em> a normal "mental projection". Because Olivia regressed and hid because of her fears deep in her subconciousness, all of her memories of everyone she knew turned malevolent, seeking to harm her as well as anything that "doesn't belong" (i.e, Peter, Water and Bell). This man, on the other hand, <em>wasn't</em> a malevolent entity — he simply sought to escape the zeppelin he was trapped in. And finally, after Olivia returned better than ever, this man's image simply appeared in her mind, and she nonchalantly stated that "he's the man who's gonna kill her."</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that he's somehow connected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWatcher">September</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">David Robert Jones</a>.

The Irish weren't really organized as a major gang like El Norte (latinos), the Homeboys (blacks), or the Aryans (neo-nazis), so he only really had his retarded brother Cyrill as muscle.

</li><li> Both Sully and Mickey from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RayDonovan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RayDonovan">Ray Donovan</a></em>. They're loyal only to themselves, collaborate with both heroes and villains, and, most importantly, they're unpredictable. Their actions are always self serving, but also impulsive, and short-sighted, and they end up screwing both the heroes and themselves as they make situations worse for everyone. Mickey collaborates with the FBI to bring down Ray <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only to kill his handler</span> and goes solo. He fakes loyalty to Sully, but ends up on Ray's side by Season 1's end, though Ray tells him to get lost. He loves his family and tries to do the right thing, but the same cannot be said for Sully. Sully used to work with Mickey until Mickey scammed him and Ray hired Sully to kill Mickey. Sully betrayed him and was let loose in Miami, only to find himself increasingly at risk in a city he doesn't fully know, with the cops and Ray's people hunting him.

Lana's first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> came about as the resulting of being possessed by her ancestor, a malevolent witch. Later seasons had her marrying Lex Luthor (who was demoted to "cuckolded husband" almost immediately), embezzling all of his money, and setting up her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapeBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapeBusters">Cape Busters</a> syndicate. She eventually became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">a super-powered secret agent</a> and left the show to pursue adventures of her own.

He actually skirts the edges of having no allegiance, because he is steadfastly loyal to Cardassia. However, he is not necessarily loyal to its current government, and he is on the side of the protagonists in later seasons because he believes the current government does not have the best interests of Cardassia in mind. Only rarely, however, is he actually opposed to the protagonists. It is not uncommon for him to be confrontational though. (Specifically, his methods do not always sit well with Starfleet ethics.)
<ul><li> Although we didn't find out his true loyalties until later seasons. Even then he displayed his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a></em> abilities by keeping people guessing if he was <em>really</em> on their side.

Unpredictable, showing up at most unexpected times, and it is anyone's guess whether it will be a lesson that leaves one better off than they were before or simply a cruel game set up from boredom/desire to experiment.
</li><li> Todd the Wraith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>. He's among the most pragmatic of the Wraith, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBrothers">seeing Sheppard as almost like a brother</a> due to their time together in a Genii prison. At the same time, he's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrinker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrinker">a Wraith</a>, and being among the smartest of his kind means he's among the <em>most dangerous</em> of his kind. The reason he's a Wild Card rather than just a villain like other Wraith is that his loyalty is solely with his own hive rather than to the Wraith species as a whole. Whenever some other hive (or a non-Wraith villain) stands to gain dominance over Pegasus that's just as bad for him as it is for the Atlantis crew.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sheppard:</strong> Here's my problem. Every time we get involved with you, I feel like I'm walking around with a live grenade in my pocket, just waiting for it all to go wrong — for that one thing you forgot to mention.

Whom he chooses to aid at any particular time depends on his ever-changing whims, although if he fears one side may destroy a piece of the Lupin Collection, he will refuse to help them.

Ostensibly, he is a Global Police specialist in studying the Lupin Collection, but he is also a phantom thief and allied with the Lupin family. He is known to change forms and alliances often, even in the midst of battle, thus leading to him being distrusted by both the Lupinrangers (since he is a liability, due to being a rival thief and knowing their identities) and the Patrangers (who suspect him of being a mole, but can't act on it due to his being officially undercover).

Special mention to Sandra, who won employing a self-proclaimed strategy of "as long as it ain't me."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>: the title character's on-again, off-again <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Homme Fatal</a> boyfriend Logan Echolls helps the investigations as often as he messes with them — all for his own shady reasons, of course.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Show</a> equivalent would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusSpace">Bonus Space</a>, but there's two particular examples that fit here:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> has a literal example — a sparkly red "Wild Card" is placed on the Wheel. When you land on the space with it and call out a correct letter, you pick it up and if you want, you can call for an extra consonant. Lucky players who haven't used it, didn't hit Bankrupt <em>and</em> make it to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> get a boost there, where it gives them an additional consonant of their choice.
</li><li> And from their sister series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild">The Joker's Wild</a></em>, the titular Joker acted as this — if you spun one or two, you could make it double as a category symbol and play that category for double its value. You could also use a Joker to call for a category that hadn't been spun (termed "going off the board"). Spinning three Jokers pretty much won the game, though you needed to give a correct answer to win.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Concentration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Concentration">Concentration</a></em> used the Wild Card in all its permutations. It matched whatever the other number selected concealed. On the original, it could be a double-edged sword—if a Wild Card is picked first and the second number revealed a Forfeit, then the player is forced to relinquish a prize from his/her rack (with hope that he/she at least has a gag prize or no prizes at all).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan">Daniel Bryan</a>. There was a time when Daniel Bryan was a Heel who thought he was a Face. He would come out and chant "YES! YES! YES!" The fans would cheer him and chant along. In order to get heat, he became a more blatant Heel. When the fans shouted YES!, he would shout NO! This had the unintended side effect of being extremely fun, and only made people like Bryan even more. His character eventually evolved to have both Heel and Face elements. Like a Heel, he would argue with the fans, get jealous of his tag team partner Kane, and even cost Kane singles matches. Like a Face, he never ran from a fight, and refused to win by cheating. Most Tweeners in wrestling are actually Faces that simply act cocky, or Heels that the fans like. However, this may be the only time a wrestler was truly unclassifiable, as he performed the tropes associated with both sides.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> makes a career out of doing this, knowing well how to manipulate the crowd. Once, he returned from a year-and-a-half hiatus, trolled the audience with a video that had nothing to do with him, and did nothing but walk around saying "Come on, baby!" for <em>ten minutes</em>. After that, when he finally started getting booed, he just <em>left</em>. The announcers remarked that they weren't even sure of what they'd just seen.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> seems to settle into this role whenever he attempts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. Mostly because, even as a face, he's kind of a prick—but a <em>smart</em>, (YMMV) <em>funny</em> prick.
</li><li> During his TNA days, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a> Cage settled into this role after the dissolution of Christian's Coalition, and his major storyline was about him trying to rebuild his burned bridges with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">faces</a> on the roster, in order to combat his allies who had now joined the Angle Alliance. The fact that he was still pretty much a cocky asshole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heel</a> in characterization really hurt his efforts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>, whose exceptional skill at both grappling and cutting promos, and his ability to carry even the most pathetic "wrestlers" to four-star affairs while remaining the Dirtiest Player In The Game throughout, made him almost impossible to boo even as he started to push sixty.
</li><li> Even at his most face-ish, the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a> would lie, cheat, and steal to get his way. It was <em>on his shirt</em>. As he once said while teaming with his nephew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChavoGuerreroJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChavoGuerreroJr">Chavo</a>, "Hey, we may lie, cheat, and steal — but at least we're honest about it."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts">Jake "The Snake" Roberts</a> was an evil version of the Wild Card. He could be a good guy for as long as he needed to.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Montreal Screwjob</a> aside, whether he's a heel or a face, even if he's just playing a commissioner, he's cheered out of the building, despite being notorious for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> kinda fits this example too. Whether he's a Face or a Heel, he will attack anybody just because he simply doesn't like him (examples: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> and "Stone Cold" Steve Austin). Also, even when he's supposed to be a heel post-1999, fans will still cheer him on such as his fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a>. His charisma and obvious desire to entertain the fans even as a heel makes it really <em><strong>really</strong></em> hard for fans to legitimately hate his character.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>. Even after turning Face again, he still feuds and fights with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> and Triple H.
<ul><li> His assaults on both John Cena's father and the McMahon family should have made him the biggest heel in the company. Instead, fans tended to cheer him more.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> also fit this example, as they will attack anybody they feel is a threat to them, not caring whether they are a Face or a Heel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>, despite turning Face in late 2003, still used Heel tactics to win some of his matches such as the one at Wrestlemania XX when he used the steel chain to defeat Big Show. Since dropping the rapper elements of his gimmick and becoming the face of the franchise he still falls short of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape">The Cape</a> despite the company's presentations, engaging in the occasional dirty tactic and contradiction of message and changing his promo cut-down tactics from being straightforward disses to relying on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">Smug Super</a> condescension to press the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>. A closer analysis of the dissonance involved with his character and push might conclude that part of the problem with Cena is he behaves like a tweener yet the company routinely shills him as the purest hero in the history of wrestling, which only adds to the clear perception that corporate pull is the main thing that's keeping him on top.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> will often be cheered regardless of his status as a face or heel due to his incredible in-ring ability. In fact, he once cut a promo proving exactly this: After saying that the US should lose in Iraq, France is better, he dislikes "the black people", and would make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> tap out, he said people ("idiots") <em>still</em> would cheer him, because they knew he was the best in the world. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6oyft_kurt-angle-dislikes-black-people-an_sport">The crowd promptly cheered<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> On the inverse of that, fans <em>continue</em> (in to 2018) to chant "YOU SUCK" at him, in time with his entrance music, as a term of endearment more than anything else.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames">Mickie James</a> has never actually been booed in WWE. Fans loved her crazed psycho lesbian stalker gimmick so much she was cheered over the also very popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a> at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 22</em> and continued to be cheered through her heel run so she turned face and has remained so throughout her entire career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix">Beth Phoenix</a> slipped into this role when she was moved to Smackdown (she had been a heel on Raw) where she was immediately shown to be out for herself and a bit of a three way feud started between her, Mickie and Michelle McCool with Beth's allegiance constantly in question. Eventually she made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. Curiously when she turned back Heel she was still getting a large amount of cheers from the crowd, due to her character having a sympathetic point of view — wanting to make the division about talent instead of looks. So later on they had to make her just care about no one except herself in order to keep her heel, save the part where she still didn't want to hurt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart">Natalya</a> when they competed on opposite sides.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KiaStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KiaStevens">Kharma</a> debuted as a Monster Heel but she only attacked heel divas at first, before then going for Face divas too. Her farewell promo blurred the lines even further.
</li><li> During the summer of 2011, the WWE pulled off the rarely-successful main event tweener feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>. John Cena is nominally the face, does face things, and is certainly beloved by younger demographics, but has long had a poor reputation with the older fans who, while no longer giving him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">X-Pac Heat</a>, think of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a> Hogan-like dominance as a clear symptom of WWE's static nature and an on-screen product that was getting old. CM Punk's current persona is the straight-edge The Guy Who Says What Older Fans Are Thinking. Officially, that makes him a heel, but understandably, it doesn't lead to him getting booed, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> antics are hilariously entertaining to boot. Throw in some excellent matches between the two of them, and the result was arenas split 50-50 with support.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> in general: since he settled into his "Straight Edge Messiah" gimmick across multiple organizations, typically the only difference between whether he's a face or a heel is how condescendingly he talks to the audience when trying to "help" them, or whether he: picks a fight then runs away; or picks a fight, kicks the guy in the face, <em>then</em> runs away. He's also pulled more than one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> by being the most beloved guy in the company for weeks or months, executing a grandiose betrayal, and calling everyone out for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">trusting him again</a>, once outright stating "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">I'm still a snake, you idiots!</a>"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam">Rob Van Dam</a> and his chilled and calm persona makes him hard to get over as a heel, because the crowd just cheer for him anyway when he does his "R. V. D" point at himself gimmick.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee">AJ Lee</a> won the title while supposedly a heel in a feud against Kaitlyn, but was cheered more for their entrances and on winning the title. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">Worked Shoot</a> that was meant to be heel aligned resulted in AJ speaking her mind about the plastic non-wrestling women who currently made up the roster, the crowd responded positively, which gained her even more popularity and cemented her as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>' 2013 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> has him saying he's sick and tired of doing the right thing and instead he'll do his own thing. During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> roster's war with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AcesAndEights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AcesAndEights">Aces &amp; Eights</a>, Styles refuses to join either side and instead viciously attacks both sides. Eventually settles into a "dark hero" role, taking the World Title off of Aces &amp; Eights for good and using it to try to make Dixie Carter pay for her managerial mistakes over the years.
<ul><li> Then in WWE, when the brand split happened and he got put on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">SmackDown Live</a> while his buddies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub">The Club</a> went to Raw, Styles's heel run really ended up just being this. He's still incredibly cocky, insults the audience, and complains whenever he got put in a situation he didn't like, but he's still acknowledged, in and out of kayfabe, as a phenomenal wrestler, he never backs down from any fight he gets booked in, and while he does cheat sometimes, he always cheats by himself, as opposed to guys like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a> who bring in outside help. The result is that he gets cheers everywhere he goes, even against beloved faces like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Being a Wild Card was explicitly a major part of Mexican legend Dos Caras's gimmick; hence the name Dos Caras, which translates to "Two Faces".

One half, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a>, is a heel that gets booed, while his "stunt double" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DamienSandow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DamienSandow">Damien Sandow</a>, who copies everything Miz does, although still technically a heel is over as a face — he went full-on face after the team broke up.

Due to their unpredictability, few mortals are willing to summon them for fear that they will disobey orders. Given that they are servants of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> Mephala, essentially the patron deity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> trope, this trait is rather understandable.
<ul><li> Many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Daedric Princes</a> come off as this, at least from the perspective of mortals. Some can be rather predictable in acting out their defining character trait, but others aren't as reliable. Of note:
<ul><li> Likely first among Wild Cards is Sheogorath, the Prince of Madness. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">enforced in his nature</a> to be a unpredictable lunatic whose "logical" thought processes couldn't be understood by anyone else.

Ranking him alongside Mehrunes Dagon (Prince of Destruction), Molag Bal (Prince of Domination, Lord of Brutality, and the <em>King of Rape</em>), and Malacath (Prince of the Spurned and Ostracized, and patron saint of the Dunmer's constant enemy, the Orsimer). <em>That's</em> how dangerous they consider Sheogorath's whims to be.
</li><li> Boetiah is the Prince of Plots, Betrayal, and Murder. Essentially making him/her the patron saint of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>. Weirdly, the Dunmer consider him/her to be one of the <em>good</em> Daedra.
</li><li> Meridia, despite being one of the more level-headed and less nakedly malicious Daedric Princes, can swing <em>wildly</em> in her allegiances.

Confounding matters is that no one really knows what her "sphere" is, or what he's the Prince <em>of</em>, exactly.

The player could also simultaneously be a wanted fugitive in Whiterun for punching the Jarl's mouthy, spoiled brat in the back of the head and escaping the guards, etc. etc..

He/She has a clear goal that is essentially a good one (prevent the Reapers from destroying all advanced organic life) but most people either don't know about the Reapers at all or don't believe they're real. Even those few who do believe the Reapers are real and a threat to all civilization (such as the Illusive Man) can be badly disappointed at how Shepard treats the problem.
<ul><li> In the first game, Shepard is mostly a diplomatic investment for the Alliance and a tool for incarcerating a rogue Spectre for the Council. S/He's in a position where it's impossible to please both and for them Shepard turns out to be something of a liability until right at the end of the game.
</li><li> In the second game the player <em>can</em> have Shepard be very cooperative with Cerberus, but because of how the game mechanics work, Shepard remains a wild card for them as well. And of course, because s/he's technically working for Cerberus, the Council and the Alliance don't really know where Shepard stands.
<div class="indent"><strong>Illusive Man:</strong> You're making a habit of costing me more than just time and money, Shepard.
</div></li><li> In the third game Shepard is reinstated in the Alliance Military, but that doesn't mean that s/he does everything they tell him/her to or in the way they hoped s/he would. However, by the time there's no intergalactic politics to meddle in in the game and most of the organizations more or less admit that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">We ARE Struggling Together</a>. Shepard is more of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> at this point, being the symbol of hope and unity as well as the Reapers' feared enemy.

Then, in 1970, when the CIA and Pentagon were bickering over the Philosopher's Legacy, he took the opportunity to join Zero. Then when he started thinking about leaving <em>HIM</em>, Zero lured him back with battle data on the "Perfect Soldier Project," and the concept of genomes.

It's especially apparent during the third game, where his single-minded pursuit of his hated rival Sub-Zero causes him to attack good and evil characters alike, and in the ninth game where he said he would only <em>defeat</em> Sub-Zero in battle, but ended up killing him anyway when Quan-Chi reminded him of what Subby supposedly did to his clan, wife, and child.

She just likes killing things. When she was forced to return, one of the first things she did was start scheming against Megatron to try to take over. Unfortunately for her, Megatron only has patience for one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Starscream</a> and eventually orders her termination when he tires of it, prompting her to go rogue and essentially become her own faction with a hive of Insecticons.

<ul><li> The page quote comes from Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord, a French diplomat who embodied this trope a couple of hundred years ago. He started out under the Gallic Church and King Louis XVI, switched sides to the anti-Church, anti-Royalist Republic, ditched them to help Napoleon seize power, converted <em>back</em> just as Napoleon had allied with Russia, convened the Senate that legally dismissed Napoleon, and finally threw his support to the Citizen King Louis-Philippe. All this time he remained powerful and influential, and even managed to stay out of prison. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> says he was known as "The Prince of Diplomats" but Napoleon himself came up with the perhaps equally fitting (if less flattering) label "shit in a silk stocking." More recent scholarship suggests that he saw himself not as betraying any particular regime, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyalToThePosition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyalToThePosition">always serving the interests of France as a state and nation</a>.

</li><li> Video game critic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Jimquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Jimquisition">Jim Sterling</a> is considered to be a wild card by many major video game publishers due to Jim's very wild and swinging viewpoints where he can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">trashing a game for its flaws and production values</a> and giving another one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GushingAboutShowsYouLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GushingAboutShowsYouLike">his most highest praise</a>. Jim's wild card persona is the reason why some publishers silently refuse to give him review copies of their games.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retronym" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retronym">First</a> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheColdWar">Cold War</a> provides several examples:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">The People's Republic of China</a>. After the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a>, the political philosophies of China and the Soviet Union began to diverge, with the Soviets becoming (relatively) more moderate. This culminated in 1969, when the two countries briefly fought a war with each other over a disputed island on the border. Three years later, China withdrew from the Eastern Bloc, opened relations with the United States (ironically for being the more radical government), and began fighting against/supporting enemies of Soviet-aligned countries such as Vietnam and Ethiopia; a massive turning point in the Cold War from which the Soviets never recovered.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">France</a>. After the Second World War, the United States pressured the country into withdrawing from Vietnam. France responded by threatening to re-align itself with the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SovietUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SovietUnion">Soviet Union</a>. In 1965, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesDeGaulle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesDeGaulle">Charles De Gaulle</a> had his government cash its entire reserve of US Dollars in exchange for gold, which helped end the Gold Standard. Finally, in 1966, De Gaulle effectively withdrew France from NATO in protest of the "special relationship" between the United States and Britain (it rejoined in 2009).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran">Iran</a>. Before the 1979 Revolution, Iran was an ally of the United States by way of the British-led CENTO bloc and a major regional supporter of western-aligned Israel (both mutually opposing the influence of neighboring Arab countries). After the Revolution, the Soviet Union became the first country to recognize the Islamic Republic in the hope of gaining a new ally. Instead, Ayatollah Khomeini denounced Communism as incompatible with Islam, leading the US and USSR to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">join forces in support of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IranIraqWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IranIraqWar">Iran's pro-Soviet enemy, Iraq.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Yugoslavia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> began the Cold War as a Communist state and strong Soviet ally. However, because Yugoslavia had expelled the Germans independently, the Soviets never had the opportunity to establish their own satellite regime there. The Yugoslav leader Tito strongly opposed Stalin's nationalist tendencies and opted to participate in the Marshall Plan, leading the Soviets to expel Yugoslavia from the Communist Information Bureau. The two countries somewhat improved relations after Stalin's death, but Yugoslavia never joined the Warsaw Pact, remained neutral, and opened trade and travel with the west.
</li></ul></li><li> Italy is famous for "changing sides" in both world wars. In the first, they stayed neutral until 1915 because technically their alliance with Germany and Austria had been <em>defensive</em> only (not that it mattered to any other European power, all claiming to be fighting defensive wars) until they joined on the <em>Allied</em> side because France and Britain promised a better deal in case of victory. After said victory a certain Benito Mussolini exploited the sense of some Italians of a "mutilated victory" consisting in the Allies not delivering on their supposed promises of 1915. So Italy ultimately joined forces with Nazi Germany, only to change sides again when Mussolini was removed from power. It ended giving Italy no major loss of pre-war territory and they even held onto some of their colonies after 1945. Of course Piedmont-Sardinia, the state that would gobble up the rest of the Italian peninsula in the 19th century did similar things, allying as the need arose with France to beat the Austrians, with revolutionary movements to unify Italy, with reactionaries to crush "too left wing" movements (like Democracy and Republicanism) and ultimately (de facto at least) with Prussia against France. If there was one thing constant about Piedmont-Sardinia's / Italy's foreign politics between 1848 and 1948, it was that whoever tried to ally with them usually got screwed, one way or another.
