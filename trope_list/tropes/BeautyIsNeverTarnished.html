They get into dangerous situations, face menacing villains, get captured, and even get into fights. But where death-defying stunts leave men visibly bruised and bloody, the women are oddly <em>put-together</em>. When women tear their clothing, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">that kind</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">Clothing Damage</a>; if their hair's unkempt it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty">artfully dishevelled</a>. Cuts on the face are always perfectly placed to emphasize their cheekbones. Basically? Fierce hand-to-hand fights are cool, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catfight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catfight">even sexy,</a> but the broken noses and black eyes they cause are not. A heroine will almost never suffer a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever">permanent</a></em> injury such as the loss of a limb or eye, no matter how much punishment she goes through. Even when heroines <em>die</em>, they'll (usually) be privileged to suffer "beautiful" deaths (IRL, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDeadBodyPoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDeadBodyPoops">corpses occasionally shit themselves</a>, and this is statistically more likely in women than in men).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In video games (especially fighting ones) in that girls and boys can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">fight</a> and both genders can take the same hits it is not uncommon for girls to have less extreme facial reactions (IE. doesn't pop out tongue, eyes don't come out of head, or general deformation such as jaws stretching out when hit under said jaw) while males tend to vary on their consequences for taking hits even if they take the same amount of damage to the HP bar.
</p><p>The other version of this trope concerns a different form of beauty: "inner" beauty — i.e., the recognition that women have bodily functions, due to being, you know, <em>human</em>. Gross-out jokes (and anything involving farts, burps, whatever) are male territory.
</p><p>This trope is generally more prevalent (and noticeable) in visual media when you can actually see the women in question. Preserving female characters' attractiveness at all costs is most likely responsible for the prevalence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girl</a> and its various related tropes. Male aliens, robots, and monsters can be as outlandish as the creator desires, but <em>female</em> aliens, robots, and monsters inevitably look just like regular attractive women with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly">fangs, horns</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">antennae</a>, or even just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe">unusual skin</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation">color</a>. Expect the aforementioned female non-humans to be nowhere near as ugly as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">they're depicted</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness">as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity">being</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This is also part of the reason that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender">Men Are the Expendable Gender</a>, and that female characters who <em>do</em> die generally get much "gentler" deaths or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">don't die onscreen.</a> After all, you can't show a woman getting set on fire, riddled with bullets, or having her head ripped off by the monster without ruining her <em>good looks</em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreMale">nobody wants that</a>. There is also a practical possibility for this in long-running works - characters who have particularly bad scars will get them on their back, chest or legs to save make-up artists the trouble of having to apply more prosthetics than they would if the scars were on the face.
</p><p>It's more common in the West, particularly in older movies and shows — however in Japan, the <em>outer</em> beauty version is often averted, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderIsNoObject">people being roughed up or exposed to violence regardless of sex/gender</a>; on the other hand, the <em>inner</em> beauty version is, if anything, much stronger. This may not protect female antagonists from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInGunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInGunge">Gunge</a>, or, less commonly, female villains from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars">appropriate scarring</a>.
</p><p>If a girl regularly averts this and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, she is probably a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapstickKnowsNoGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapstickKnowsNoGender">Slapstick Knows No Gender</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtForcefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtForcefield">Dirt Forcefield</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickingAssInAllHerFinery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickingAssInAllHerFinery">Kicking Ass in All Her Finery</a>. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty">Unkempt Beauty</a>. For the clothing only, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofFashionPlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofFashionPlate">Bullet-Proof Fashion Plate</a>. A common specific form involves characters (especially women) who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes">Does Not Like Shoes</a>, whose feet are very rarely shown to be as dirty and/or calloused as those of people who habitually go barefoot outdoors are in real life.
</p><p>If beauty <em>is</em> tarnished and then subsequently killed off, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDisfigurement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDisfigurement">Death by Disfigurement</a>. If she lives, it's almost always a ticket to the land of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>, via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyToBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyToBeast">Beauty to Beast</a>.

They also never suffer battle injuries: the closest is Ran getting her hair ribbon cut, which just causes her flowing black hair to fall down in a rather fetching manner.
</li><li> Played straight in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, where Nanoha and Fate get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">Clothing Damage</a> at best while Chrono is shown with his face half covered in blood.
</li><li> Balsa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MoribitoGuardianOfTheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MoribitoGuardianOfTheSpirit">Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit</a></em> receives some serious injuries during the series, but none of them leave visible scars. We can assume she <em>must</em> have a nasty one on her stomach, but her clothes are rather modest and only show her arms and face, which remain untarnished.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, both students and heroes end up in dangerous situations against villains and disasters that leave them bloodied, heavily injured and often scared, however, this only applies to the male characters. Female characters are rarely, if at all, seriously injured and at worst rendered unconscious without serious external damage due to an enemies quirk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Double-subverted with Nami. The serious damage she receives during her more intense fights does show, but as soon as the fights are over, in any of the more minor battles, and in the long run overall, her skin is absolutely flawless. The most ridiculous is probably the case of her shoulder; she <em>stabbed</em> it repeatedly during her epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> at Arlong Park, and it left a very large and visible scar (which you can see <a class="urllink" href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/File:Nami_Scar.png">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, above the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a>) for the remainder of the arc. As soon as the arc was over? She got a new tattoo and her scar was nowhere to be seen. But deep stab-wound scars like that, in real life, are particularly nasty and never quite heal so completely.
<ul><li> In the manga, for some time the scar was still visible a bit under her new tattoo the times she wore sleeveless shirts, but by the Whisky Peak arc it completely disappeared. Maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EiichiroOda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EiichiroOda">Eiichiro Oda</a> thought it was too much of a hassle to draw.
</li></ul></li><li> Double-subverted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sanji's brother</span> Vinsmoke Yonji. Sanji kicked him so hard in the face during their confrontation that his face resembled a piece of bent metal, and stayed that way for a while. The only way he could successfully restore his face to normal was by using a <em>press machine</em>, and he's looking fine afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> For someone who is consistently a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> who gets attacked often, Jessie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> sure has immaculate makeup. It doesn't matter if she's having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickEpisode">Sick Episode</a> or being attacked by Pokemon, her hair always bounces back without styling needed and her lipstick never smudges. In fact, the only time she's probably ever even <em>shown</em> without makeup was a XY <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainEpisode">Villain Episode</a>.
</li><li> The absolute majority of female characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> almost never suffer physical injuries (comically that is; when it comes time for occasional serious drama, especially in the final arc, some injuries will be necessary). It's always the guys (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag">those guys</a>) who get punched, kicked, rocked, shocked, burned, and subjected to all other kinds of cartoon violence. Poor them, considering the main good guys are pretty chivalrous letting the girls beat them to a pulp, and even get upset when a bad guy even dares go physical on girls. The only exceptions are Ranma's female self, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror">Magic Mirror</a> female clone, the two devious yet stupid Chinese sisters who get beaten up by Shampoo, and Konatsu's butt-ugly step-mother and step-sisters (well, technically they aren't "beauties").
</li><li> Played straight initially with Flamenco Girl in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco">Samurai Flamenco</a></em>. In some of her early fights, she does get hit from time to time, but nothing too drastic that would make her look bad.
</li><li> Played relatively straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei">Sekirei</a></em>, with tons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">Clothing Damage</a> and minor injuries that never scar. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageBabe">Haihane</a> is notable as the only Sekirei with visible scarring, but this may be justified since it's suggested they have better-than-human healing and access to incredibly advanced medical technology. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Karasuba notes that MBI's treatments are so advanced, the near-fatal injuries she received from Miya's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> left only a small scar.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TenjhoTenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TenjhoTenge">Tenjho Tenge</a></em> tends to go both ways on this. In both the anime and the manga, women are engaged in battle just as much as, if not more than, men. However, in the animated version, the effects of combat towards the girls tend to be limited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">Clothing Damage</a> or injuries which don't obscure beauty, like bruises away from the face or sprained limbs. The manga, which is a great deal more violent, has many female characters face <em>terrible and permanent</em> disfigurement for their lifestyle choices (such as crushed faces, severed limbs, eyes stabbed, and other wonderful things). However, the main female cast, like Maya and Aya, tend to not face such consequences. Although, since they are legendary fighters, it could just be their skill. Maya is also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nearly beaten to death by Kagiroi</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em> normally if any accident occurs, the males will suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a> while the girls just get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">Clothing Damage</a> or other embarrassing things.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki">Uzumaki</a></em>, protagonist Kirie suffers burns that are serious enough to put her in hospital for some time, yet manage to mostly miss her face. Once she leaves the hospital, the ones on her legs are also fully healed without a trace of scarring.
</li><li> In <em>Franchise/Digimon</em>, despite being tortured by Myotismon, Gatomon only gets one scar, on its paw (which is usually concealed by other things anyway). Its digivolution, Angewomon, doesn't have any scars at all and is the series's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissFanservice">Miss Fanservice</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFRANXX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFRANXX">DARLING in the FRANXX</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Wild Child</a> Zero Two had a childhood where she was treated more like a circus lion than a human, complete with chains and sedatives. Yet in the present day (when she's someone's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>) she wears a perfectly coiffed military uniform, her hair is well-groomed, and she is able to function in human society just as well- if not <em>better</em>- than people who had human contact growing up.

</li><li> Seen in earlier X-Men teams, too, where the physical mutations seemed to pop up only in male characters — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastMarvelComics">Beast</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a> are visibly abnormal, Angel has hard-to-hide wings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> had claws.

Besides the fact that she's a clone of the famously <em>un</em>attractive Wolverine, she's been shot, stabbed, slashed, gutted, blown up, burned down to a <em>skeleton</em>, and had limbs hacked off entirely, and the only lasting mark on her body is the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> emblem associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainUniverse">Captain Universe</a></span> on the palm of her right hand. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> since she has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, but the sheer amount of physical abuse she sustains makes it pretty egregious.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/UltimateSpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/UltimateSpiderWoman">Ultimate Spider-Woman</a></em>: Mary Jane Watson has been smashed into walls, zapped with electrical bolts, slashed by razor bats, burned with flame, and been punched square in the face, but she's never suffered any permanent scars or blemishes. Her injuries tend to heal rather quickly by themselves once she gets some rest, although she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutHimselfShaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutHimselfShaving">still sometimes has to explain how she got hurt in the first place.</a> She typically claims that she was caught up in a supervillain attack, which is more plausible than you might think because of how many supervillains are causing mayhem in New York at any given time.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildrenOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildrenOfTime">Children of Time</a></em> in the cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and Beth Lestrade.

However, in the case of the second situation, he <em>is</em> left dirty and smelling like the Thames — the regeneration healed injuries and scars <em>only</em>.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/NaturalSelection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/NaturalSelection">Natural Selection</a></em>. Characters who undergo injuries have them described long after the injuries occur. Satsuki gets this the most as her injuries are gone over all throughout the Naturals Election. Nui and Ryuko, however, play this trope straight. Though in their case, it's justified due to both of them possessing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">healing factors</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnneOfTheIndies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnneOfTheIndies">Anne of the Indies</a></em>: Molly (played by Debra Paget) is abducted and held prisoner by pirates and suffers nothing more than some decorous damage to her dress.

Black Widow, however, other than bleeding from her forehead and lip, suffers little visible damage. Keep in mind that this character is introduced in the film <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being tortured by Russian terrorists</span> and later spends a significant amount of time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fighting the Hulk and having a building fall on her</span>. On the other hand, Maria Hill winds up with some pretty nasty cuts to her face after narrowly avoiding death-by-grenade, remaining bruised and bloody until the action subsides and she's seen getting medical attention.

<ul><li> Subverted by Selina Kyle after she is pushed through a window to her (presumed) death. She has a large, bloody cut on her head from where a shard of glass slashed her, and upon landing in the alley she loses consciousness and lays in the snow for so long that her skin goes icy white. Then about a dozen cats show up and crawl over her body, one of them <em>chewing her fingers</em> and drawing a fair amount of blood. Then her eyes roll around in their sockets, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">Undertaker</a>-style, as she regains consciousness. <em>Then</em>, upon arriving home, she slowly undergoes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic Breakdown</a> that begins with her messily downing an entire carton of milk, spilling a good portion of it on her dress and leaving her with a "milk mustache"; she can also be seen <em>drooling</em> the milk from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">maniacally grinning lips</a> as she goes crazy in subsequent shots.
</li><li> Played straight with the Ice Princess. The Penguin hits her in the face with a sharp-edged Batarang (stolen from Batman by one of his minions in an earlier scene) the approximate size and shape of a Frisbee, which had earlier flattened three grown men — and although Commissioner Gordon tells the news media that there was blood on the Batarang when the police found it, in subsequent scenes the girl is not bleeding and doesn't even show scar tissue. Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the last we see of her, she's falling from an impossibly high building and is killed when she lands face-first on the Gotham Plaza dais, so her pretty face almost certainly got mashed to a pulp — but we never see her autopsy photos, so we'll never know for sure</span>.

However, when she washes up on shore, she's only just got a bit of dirt on her face.

Storm gets into some pretty rough fights scenes with Callisto but never comes away with anything worse than tousled hair.

This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBeautyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBeautyUpgrade">huge departure</a> from real life where Diogo is often depicted as a hardy, bearded man (like you would expect from a man stranded in a savage land for a <em>long</em> time).
</li><li> In the 1958 film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CatOnAHotTinRoof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CatOnAHotTinRoof">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a></em>, Maggie (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethTaylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>) goes out to the pouring rain and gets her hair soaking wet, but the next time we see her, it's perfectly dry and styled.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChargeAtFeatherRiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChargeAtFeatherRiver">The Charge at Feather River</a></em>, all of the men look suitably dishevelled following their hard cross-country ride/hike: dusty, sweaty, unshaven, numerous small wounds, their clothes rumpled, etc. Anne McKeever, however, still looks fresh and rested, her face clean, and her hair styled in a suspiciously 50s coif. Her sister Jennie also looks presentable, but has more justification: being dressed in hardwearing buckskin and having her hair in practical plaits.
</li><li> In the newest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasSparks">Nicholas Sparks</a> offering, <em>The Choice</em>, the heroine is hit by a car and spends an undetermined amount of time in a coma (in the book, it's for a full year).

This, combined with her habit of just showing up without provisions even though she's following the same route as the others, gives the impression that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">curse</a> isn't immortality but the ability to <em>teleport</em>, and she's just porting in from Argos whenever she's needed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DWar">D-War</a></em> has the heroes' car blasted by a dragon's fireball, flip a few times in the air and skid along the ground, only to have the woman emerge (white sweater included) completely unscathed. Of course, there was a little bit of black soot on her face.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em>, Matt Murdock has many scars all over his body, although his face is left untouched. Elektra, despite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a stab through her hand, a cut on her neck, broken back, head injury and getting gutted</span>, is still pretty enough that Bullseye tried to kiss her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em>, Bruce also has several scars along his back but again, his face is okay.
</li><li> Slightly subverted in the climactic shoot-out in <em>Duel in the Sun</em>: although Pearl's <em>face</em> is untouched, her clothes and especially her hands are realistically torn and bloody after she crawls up a mountain on her hands and knees—possibly because actress Jennifer Jones really did injure herself in the process.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEye">The Eye</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaAlba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaAlba">Jessica Alba</a>'s character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is twice blinded by explosions, the first from a firecracker and the second from an exploding tanker sending windshield glass into her eye.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EyesWideShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EyesWideShut">Eyes Wide Shut</a></em>: All of the women are subject to this.
<ul><li> Domino looks very beautiful for a dying, drug-addicted prostitute.
</li><li> After <em>just</em> OD-ing at Ziegler's house, Mandy looks no different than a healthy person (and beautiful).
</li><li> We also never see the death of the woman at the party, and while Bill looks at Mandy's corpse, she never looks visibly injured.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFinal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFinal">The Final</a></em> both plays straight and averts the trope. Two female bullies get chemicals smeared all over their face to destroy their good looks forever, and one gets two of her fingers cut off. However, far more male bullies are tortured than females despite there being a well developed female bully who never gets tortured. Also, Emily is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shot in the head</span> but this isn't shown.
</li><li> If you go with the hypothesis that Jenny from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump">Forrest Gump</a></em> has AIDS, you'll be left wondering why you don't see her with sores and lesions from Kaposi's Sarcoma, hair graying and loss, and other nasty symptoms associated with that disease. Particularly naïve children watching the film might speculate that she died from...being extremely tired, perhaps? The same goes for his cancer-stricken mother.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsOfNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsOfNewYork">Gangs of New York</a></em> (2002), the only punishment inflicted on Amsterdam Vallon (played by pretty-boy actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDiCaprio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>) for his attempted assassination of Bill "The Butcher" is a mild scar on his cheek. This is from a man who <strong>cut out his own eye for flinching!</strong>
<ul><li> When they get to the final battle, this is completely thrown out the window. After one explosion, he's covered in dust, and his hair gets blown out of its pretty little bun, for God's sake. Not to mention that when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kills Bill</span>, he gets blood <em>all over himself</em>. There's also the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> limp he receives from Bill after being slashed across the back of the knee. It didn't look like it was going to clear up</span>.
</li><li> Jenny Everdeanne. She has scars but placed where almost no one can see them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneGirl">Gone Girl</a></em>: When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Amy kills Desi</span>, somehow she manages to be soaked in blood from the neck down. A gorefest with a pretty face, it plays this trope very straight.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardRevengeMilly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardRevengeMilly">Hard Revenge, Milly</a></em>. Milly is tortured and mutilated by the Jack Brothers in flashbacks (with a certain amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">Gory Discretion Shot</a>) but they leave her face untouched, even though she bit one of them on the face. In the main film, all of her injuries are covered by her normal clothes, and we just see her pretty face.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeroicTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeroicTrio">Heroic Trio</a></em>, a Hong Kong movie featuring three beautiful superheroines, lampshades this at one point. The characters narrowly avoid getting blown up. One of the characters turns to the other and quickly asks, "Am I still pretty?". At most, they get bloodied mouths and dirt smeared on their faces, so the answer is yes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>:
<ul><li> Due to medical treatments, Katniss's swollen Tracker Jacker stings completely vanish in the next scene. The cut she receives on her face all but vanishes in the next scene as well. For all the time she spends sleeping outside and fighting to the death, she still looks great by the end.
</li><li> This goes for the other female Tributes too on the whole — even little Rue looks rather perfectly coiffured and clean, for a twelve-year-old surviving in the woods. In life, Glimmer also looks salon-perfect — but the trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> by the state of her dead body after the tracker-jackers kill her.
</li></ul></li><li> Mia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IfIStay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IfIStay">If I Stay</a></em>, in her out-of-body state, looking the same as she did before the accident.

She also gets locked inside a metal cage and lowered into a lava pit. She's only a teensy bit sweaty when she's rescued, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionShmonvection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionShmonvection">showing no visible burns or signs of heat stroke.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jailbait2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jailbait2014">Jailbait (2014)</a></em>: Despite numerous beatings and assaults, the worst injury Anna sustains is some bruising that disappears by the next nude scene and a small scar on her cheek.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldeneye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldeneye">Goldeneye</a></em>, as the half-naked Bond and Xenia wrestle in the sauna, he gets the upper hand, draws his gun, and demands that she take him to the as-yet-unseen villain. When they arrive at the villain's headquarters, <em>she's</em> disheveled, as one would expect as she had to hurriedly dress at gunpoint. Bond, however, is as impeccably dressed as ever, which he somehow managed despite holding a gun on her.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay">Die Another Day</a></em>. Bond is filthy with a shaggy beard and hair after being tortured for 14 months. This is 007 at his most unkempt in the entire <em>series</em>, and audiences at the time were a bit shocked to see the character in such a disheveled state. However, Bond is still in remarkably good shape for someone who had endured that type of hell for so long. All it takes are a single shave, a hair cut and a change of clothes for Bond to become sexy again.

</li><li> While the Bride suffers plenty of beat downs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill">Kill Bill</a></em> and is frequently seen bloodied and bruised, none of her injuries or ordeals leave any lasting visible damage or scars.

</div></li><li> Particularly noticeable in movies from the 1950s and so (at least, those rare movies where women ventured out). See <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLeechWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLeechWoman">The Leech Woman</a></em> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">MST3K</a></em>, whose leading lady romps through the jungle in a white blouse — and it stays white the whole time! Ajax, strong on dirt?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLegendOfZorro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLegendOfZorro">The Legend of Zorro</a></em>, Catherine Zeta-Jones runs across a dirt field at full speed, fights with a shovel, runs back across the same field at full speed, falls in the dirt at least once, and when she gets back to her room her white nightgown is spotless and she doesn't have a hair out of place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesMiserables2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesMiserables2012">Les Misérables (2012)</a></em> goes for "extreme realism" according to the director, with the depiction of 1800s France, and the trope is averted by having Fantine's beauty get destroyed by poverty (Anne Hathaway lost a lot of weight and had her hair cut off to provide the effect). But it's still played straight in other areas; Eponine for example is poor and unhealthy in the book, yet this version of her has clear skin and perfectly waxed eyebrows with her hair only attractively messy. Cosette's child self only has a little bit of messy hair, and looks very good for someone forced to work like a dog in the Thernardiers' inn. And Mme Thernardier is given a healthy dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a> and just has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty">Unkempt Beauty</a> for the scenes where she's starving on the streets.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, Frodo loses a finger, Boromir catches several arrows in his chest, Aragorn spends the whole trilogy bloody, bruised, and scraped. Practically all of the cast is harassed by either the Watcher in the Water or a Cave troll. And all pretty boy Legolas gets over the course of is a bruise and a little smudge of dirt. And Éowyn made it through almost the entire Battle of the Pelennor Fields unscathed, with never a cut or a bruise until the Witch-King smashes her shield and her arm with his gigantic mace.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveStory">Love Story</a></em>: Jennifer Cavalleri Barrett, despite suffering from leukemia, never looks anything but as lovely as she has throughout the entire film.

</li><li> Greer Garsons Oscar-acceptance speech for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrsMiniver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrsMiniver">Mrs. Miniver</a></em> was famously the longest in history. She thanked her hairdresser and costume designer and everyone else who had anything to do with the production. She had reason to be thankful, since her character gets through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHomeFront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHomeFront">London Blitz</a> without a hair out of place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a></em>, the female companion is in a very, very nasty car crash and is shown in the hospital with little more than a band-aid on one cheek and still having perfect hair and makeup.
</li><li> Played both ways in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneHundredFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneHundredFeet">100 Feet</a></em>. Marnie sports multiple bruises and contusions and the occasional cut but never suffers anything worse despite being hit hard enough to be thrown across the room.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetTerror">Planet Terror</a></em>, in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseMcGowan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseMcGowan">Rose McGowan</a> gets her leg chopped off, to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">replaced by an assault rifle with an underslung grenade launcher</a>. However, one will notice that all of the major female characters survive the film, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood">notable exception of Fergie's character</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerHeartWillGoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerHeartWillGoOn">Very few dudes make it out alive</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Poseidon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Poseidon">Poseidon</a></em>, everyone else gets thoroughly soaked several times before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Emmy Rossum</a>'s hair <em>finally</em> stays matted down as it should. After that, everyone's a mess.
</li><li> The trope is in full force in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predators">Predators</a></em>. All the male characters are filthy and battle damaged by the end of the film (or at least, the end of their participation in it). The lone female? Barely covered in a light, even film of dirt, not any hint of actual damage. The one bit of damage she's seen to take is suitably out of the way that it doesn't have to get filmed in subsequent shots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyOrNot2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyOrNot2019">Ready or Not (2019)</a></em>: Grace is bruised, bloodied, stabbed through the hand, dropped down a hole and covered in dirt — but her face is still clean and pretty at the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> has Alice make it through the entire ordeal without so much as a scratch. The worst she gets is a little wet. Illustrating just how much this trope is in effect, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich">Milla Jovovich</a> noted that her body was covered in lesions and bruises after shooting the brief scene where she is dragged along the grille of the train.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SafeHaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SafeHaven">Safe Haven</a></em>, the heroine is able to give herself a perfect haircut and dye job in the midst of frantically fleeing from her abusive husband. She also doesn't have a mark on her even though a flashback shows that he slapped and tried to strangle her before she fought him off and managed to get away, and she's sporting perfect makeup, which would hardly be the top priority of a frightened woman desperate to get out of town.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity">Serenity</a></em>, where the female crew gets banged up pretty badly, though mostly in areas away from their faces.
<ul><li> Zoe's face remains untouched, but her back receives a horrible slash that will probably become a rather unattractive scar, even with Simon's medical skills.
</li><li> Kaylee is incapacitated by a series of poison darts, leaving her skin and face untouched.
</li><li> Inara is bitten in the face by a Reaver, but by the end scenes is just as lovely as ever.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead">Shaun of the Dead</a></em>. No one, except for Shaun, gets really bloody and dirty until the end. Even then, Liz is still better off than Shaun.
<div class="indent">"You've got some red on you."
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SinCity">Sin City</a></em>, there is a scene where Dwight (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CliveOwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CliveOwen">Clive Owen</a>) and Miho (Devon Aoki) both plunge into a tar pit, coating themselves entirely in black tar. Miho is naked when she jumps into the tar, although it's hard to tell (the comic is more explicit in this detail) she should at least have tar stuck to her skin. Dwight is similarly clean and he actually fell into the tar while fully clothed. Miho also had blood splashed all over her face in an earlier scene, which also got cleaned up inexplicably very quickly. Oh, and the men get bruised up and battered a lot, showing scars, cuts, and blood all over in this movie. Some women do die, but it is normally clean gunshot and there is not near as much dirt on them.
</li><li> Played straight for the first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteATaleOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteATaleOfTerror">Snow White: A Tale of Terror</a></em>. Lilli is involved in a cave-in underground and is seen with dirt all over her after they get out, but is perfectly clean the next time we see her. It's implied she washes in the stream. Then at the end, Claudia cuts her face with a pane of glass.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman">Snow White and the Huntsman</a></em>. The two title characters come across a village inhabited only by women, all of whom intentionally scarred their own faces so they would be considered ugly in the eyes of Queen Ravenna, sparing them from being sacrificed to her life-stealing magic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam">Space Jam</a></em>, Lola Bunny is the only main cartoon character that never suffers any kind of injury, or, indeed, any kind of indignity. Other characters (mainly Bugs) even deliberately take hits intended for her. This did not help her popularity of the perception that she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>, especially since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a> has allowed other female characters like Granny to fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapstickKnowsNoGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapstickKnowsNoGender">Slapstick Knows No Gender</a> for years.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> Rosie still looks pretty good for someone who was killed by a hundred shards of flying glass, including at least one to the face/eye.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a></em>:
<ul><li> Carol Marcus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gets fed a piece of the scenery by Khan when she gets in his way, and shortly afterwards has her leg stepped on by him, complete with a sickening crunch.

</li><li> Unlike Spock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kirk doesn't have any burns on his face and hands when he dies of radiation poisoning after repairing the warp drive</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nothing ever mars Princess Leia's beauty no matter what happens to her — captured, tortured, broken out in a shoddy rescue attempt (let's be serious, it was rather unprofessional), and to top it off, dumped in a garbage bin — she still looked great after it all. And <em>that</em> was just the <em>first</em> movie. Of particular note was <em>her hair</em>. Almost all of her hairstyles would be difficult — if not impossible — for a hairstylist to even <em>create</em>, to say nothing of keeping them in place after all she goes through. Ironically, the most realistic one was the style she had in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGoEnslavement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGoEnslavement">Jabba's prisoner</a>. (And in that case, <em>the rest</em> of the outfit was very unrealistic.) Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Vespa:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">You shot my HAIR!</a>
</div></li><li> Padme is the same in the prequels, but at least in her case, her clothing usually seems to have been made with combat in mind in such situations. In the climax of <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Anakin, having embraced his Darth Vader persona by this time (although not yet in the cybernetic suit and mask) Force-chokes her in a mistakenly vengeful rage. Instead of breaking into undignified gagging as Admiral Motti did in <em>A New Hope</em>, Padme only gasps softly and then faints</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>, only Rey remains unwounded while Finn and Kylo Ren both have serious injuries after the three of them duel with lightsabers. Also when Poe is strapped to the torture machine he is shown to have gotten bruises and blood all over, but when Rey is put to the same device, not a single one to be seen<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0u6lu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0u6lu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0u6lu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually, that frame doesn't seem to be a torture device, just a restraint. Poe was tortured by an interrogation droid that can be seen over Kylo Ren's shoulder in a few shots. We never see the droid in Rey's interrogation scene, so Rey probably wasn't tortured at all. But, that just further enforces this trope</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>, Rey gets a nasty slice on her upper arm during her fight with Snoke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a>. It remains visible until the end of the film (it's even on the poster), and it looks deep enough to scar. But all it does is contribute to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars">rugged, action hero image</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetsOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetsOfFire">Streets of Fire</a></em>, McCoy and Ellen Aim aren't hurt at all by the gang, while the men get the snot beat out of them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a></em> Sarah Connor's hair is immaculate at the end of the film, despite having been at ground zero for two explosions, being chased all night by a Terminator, and all the other damage she suffered.
</li><li> Films of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a> had a rare exception to their usual standard of not actually hitting a woman. A short featured the Stooges as cavemen courting. Moe and Larry have their mates subdued in stereotypical clubbed-hard style. Shemp's beloved had to bash <em>him</em>. The rival tribe comes along, sees the Stooges hauling the women away, and hurls spears at them, sticking in the usual rear slapstick target. Since Shemp is the one being dragged, though, it's the woman who's hit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers</a></em> doesn't go too overboard on this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeganFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeganFox">Megan Fox</a>, but it is really glaring in reference to the robots. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a> for GM vehicles apparently mandates that all of the Autobots' car modes must be sparklingly clean at all times.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></em> plays this trope noticeably straight. Megan Fox looks as though her (rather overdone) makeup was being touched up every 30 seconds. This is particularly jarring in the final battle, when every other (human) character is covered in filth and blood, Fox still looks perfectly clean and her make up is totally untouched after both her and the main lead get poorly teleported to the other side of the world, run several miles through the hot desert, have several explosions happen basically on top of them, and get thrown into the sand. The main lead is bleeding, grimy, and filthy while she just has her hair a bit rumpled.
</li><li> And then in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon">the third film</a>, after being thrown through a building, running through an apocalyptic battleground, the lead and the soldiers with them are suitably beaten up, <em>Carly's hair and white jacket aren't even ruffled.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Untraceable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Untraceable">Untraceable</a></em>. The male victims suffer agonisingly slow deaths with obvious and continuous physical damage (i.e. one victim is submerged up to his neck in a tank slowly of sulfuric acid). The heroine's suspended over a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a> that will either kill her instantly or let her escape without a scratch.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em>, Evie's appearance doesn't suffer at all after a prolonged period of imprisonment and torture. It can even be argued that having her hair shaved down to stubble just makes her look even more doe-eyed and delicate. This is in stark contrast to the comic, where she looks like a mummy afterwards.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Versus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Versus">Versus</a></em>, every single character with the exception of the female lead ends up literally coated in blood; and the male lead is implied to lose an eye (although it could be just stuck shut). More than that, her white shirt isn't stained in the least.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wolves">Wolves</a></em>: Cayden is left badly injured after his first fight with Connor, but everything heals after he wolfs out, including scars. Although wolfing out while that injured is apparently <em>very</em> painful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017">Wonder Woman (2017)</a></em>: A highly egregious example occurs during the sniper scene where Diana takes down the sniper by jumping into the tower the sniper was in, destroying it. Diana walks out of the rubble all clean and her hair still fresh. May actually be a subversion due to her being a supernatural being, so mortal stuff kind of just....pings off of her not showing any lasting damage. Now when she fights Ares......

Suzie in fact has been homeless since she was ten, and is attractively svelte. This is all explained in the book - where Suzie previously lived with a cousin who took care of her for a couple of years before she became a prostitute. And even then they worked a dance hall with rich businessmen as their clients - so they weren't sleeping with that many. The girls at the Nam Kok are also considered a step above street walkers and the hotel arranges for them to have weekly medical checks.

Many of the Ghosts refuse to go to Heaven because it will mean giving up their quirks, such as saying mean things to their loved ones. The contrapositive of that statement also falls under this trope. <em>Everything</em> in us can find its fullest and most joyful expression in Heaven if it will only submit first to God. Specifically seen in the case of the Lizard, which represented a certain Ghost's uncontrollable lust. After the Lizard is killed by an Angel (with the Ghost's permission), the Ghost turns into a Person, and the Lizard is reincarnated as a Stallion, an expression of joyful, holy, physicality.

<ul><li> Such a common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> trope that soap magazines frequently ridicule it and need to praise the few times that it's Averted or even subverted:
<ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldAndTheBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldAndTheBeautiful">The Bold and the Beautiful</a></em>, after Brooke had a nervous breakdown and spent weeks wandering the beaches of Barbados, critics blasted the storyline for many reasons, not the least of which was that this supposedly mentally ill and homeless woman was apparently still managing to take showers, brush her teeth, comb her hair, and make regular trips to the salon, as evidenced by her perfect hair, skin, nails, teeth, and clothing. This was also done when Taylor Hayes was burned in a house fire. After several weeks of angsting over whether or not she would be disfigured, the bandages were removed  and as a writer for Soap Opera Digest snarked, "I've had <em>sunburns</em> that were worse than that."

While the attractive cast often gets in fights that leave them bruised and bloodied, facial wounds, including deep-looking cuts, typically heal over in a couple of episodes. Notable facial scarring is quite rare. Many characters also manage surprisingly well-kept appearances despite their very rough lifestyles.

<ul><li> It's usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">played straight</a> with Simmons, who can get infected with deadly viruses, chased and captured by the bad guys, and generally be thrown around a lot without looking too much the worse for it a few minutes later.

</li><li> Played straight with Skye during her homeless period at the start of the show, when she's supposedly living in her van but nevertheless reliably in full make-up with amazing hair.
</li><li> May is an interesting example: as the show's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> she's often shown as messy, bloodied, and dishevelled as the guys — up to and including stitching up her own stab wounds in a spare moment — in an apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a> of this trope; yet somehow that seems to be part and parcel of her particular brand of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Fanservice</a>.
<ul><li> Played straight in the Season 1 finale, when after May's long and very brutal fight with Ward, May has no visible bruises and looks like she hasn't been in a fight at all (in contrast to Ward, whose face is very beaten up).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Played straight for the most part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, at least in terms of their faces. Oliver is heavily scarred on his chest and abdomen, but never his face.

The guys were sweaty, rumpled, and grungy, but their resident girl looked utterly perfect at all times, to the extent of her white shirt and pale slacks remaining spotless while she was kneeling in a hole digging for ancient artifacts.
</li><li> Tracy in Season 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch">Baywatch</a></em> turns out to have advanced cancer, yet shows almost no outward signs of suffering from the illness.

Justified in-universe, in that (a) anyone with a secret identity <em>needs</em> to cover up scars they couldn't have gotten in their civilian persona, and (b) with the kind of money and technology that lies beyond a lot of DC heroes, it wouldn't be too hard to come up with makeup that good.
</li><li> In the UK science show <em>Brainiac</em>, there are male and female test subjects (called 'Brainiacs') who are subject to experiments. You will find that for all of the experiments that subject a person to pain (such as electric shock), getting dirty, urinating, or just behaving in an uncivilized manner, female Brainiacs are never chosen. They usually take on administrative roles and assess the males who perform these kinds of experiments. The exception seems to be the "Can You Do Your Job While Being Electrocuted?" skit — where a female checkout operator, ballroom dancer and school teacher were used.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingIn">Breaking In</a></em>, when, after being caught in a very strong security system, all of the male members of the team sustained bruises or some other sort of minor injury (including one getting his eyebrows burned off), and Melanie does not. She gets called out on it, with people wondering why she doesn't seem to have a scratch on her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> One egregious example is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E5BeerBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E5BeerBad">Beer Bad</a>", where tainted beer turned a group of frat boys and Buffy into Neanderthals. The boys actually transformed into stereotypical cavemen while Buffy just acted differently and had a few tangles in her hair.
</li><li> Usually played straight with Faith, and easily explained by the enhanced resilience enjoyed by all Slayers. Even after extended battles with Buffy, who hit harder than most vampires, Faith always looked fine, without even a smudge on her makeup.
<ul><li> While attempting to defeat The Beast in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS04E13Salvage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS04E13Salvage">Salvage</a>", Faith suffers a horrific beatdown, and is so bloody and battered afterwards that she can barely walk. Her reactions afterwards show that her confidence is just as damaged as her body.
</li></ul></li><li> The first fight Buffy and Faith had with each other did leave a few bruises on each other's face.
</li><li> In her debut episodes, Fred looks more like she spent a few days camping than five years in a hell dimension.
</li><li> A rare gender-swapped version; Spike is simultaneously the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey">Iron Butt Monkey</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Mr. Fanservice</a>. The guy gets his ass kicked just about every other episode, but very, <em>very</em> rarely does his handsome face actually <em>see</em> any of the damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBurningBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBurningBed">The Burning Bed</a></em>: Francine gets some black eyes but still looks pretty good after Mickey beats her up, with a minimum of swelling and redness. Of course, she's played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FarrahFawcett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FarrahFawcett">Farrah Fawcett</a>, who was an incredibly attractive woman.
</li><li> Played with on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em>. Sarah frequently gets into fights with that episode's bad guy or mooks. Usually, she comes off without a scratch despite often taking several good hits. Other times she's had bruises and split lips. Some notorious fights (the high school reunion and car fights in Season 2 and Season 4's catwalk fight) ended with her face rather battered and bloody. Nonetheless, by the next episode, her face is back in perfect condition (one wonders how no one ever seems to notice). Chuck himself has been in several fights from Season 3 forward but never shows a sign of having been hit. Casey has sustained several visible injuries over the course of the series, but they seldom carry over into subsequent episodes. Most notoriously, after being shot in the leg in Season 3 and needing emergency surgery performed, in the episode set the <em>very next day</em> he shows no sign that he was ever wounded.
</li><li> The classic Polish series <em>Czterej pancerni i pies</em> had a precise rule about this. All the male characters would get dirty and greasy but all the female characters would always be shown with no dirt and clean clothes even though they were supposedly experiencing the same wartime conditions as the men. This was done very deliberately to soften the impact of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> series on a viewing public that lived through the war.

Peri also gets poisoned and dragged through most of the same stuff he does, but all that happens to her is her skin and lips becoming romantically pale.
</li><li> When Martha Jones appears in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E13LastOfTheTimeLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E13LastOfTheTimeLords">"Last of the Time Lords"</a>, she's a refugee who has been walking the post-apocalyptic Earth for a year, barely a step ahead of the Master and his forces, facing exhaustion, blistering heat and freezing cold. Despite all this, she looks no less well-rested and well-groomed than she did while traveling with the Doctor.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E2TheWitchsFamiliar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E2TheWitchsFamiliar">The Witch's Familiar</a>", Missy pushes Clara down a hole to see how deep it is. After falling twenty feet and landing on solid rock, Clara has virtually nothing to show for it except some scrapes. Similarly, when she is later hooked up to a Dalek in the same episode, she comes out of the experience looking as perky as ever.

<ul><li> This show provides a rare example with a male character. When Ser Loras Tyrell removes his helm in "Blackwater", his curly hair looks perfect despite having fought a battle; he even does a mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairFlip">Hair Flip</a>. There doesn't appear to be a single scratch or bruise on him. <a class="urllink" href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4qbcj850i1qk4ih5o1_500.gif">A popular animated gif on tumblr<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> pokes fun at this improbable moment.
</li><li> Another such example which can even be contrasted with a female is that in Season 7, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jorah Mormont is cured of greyscale</span>, leaving virtually no visible effect. In contrast, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shireen Baratheon was permanently marked by the disease</span>.
</li><li> In the books, Daenerys' hair is burned off in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfTheInferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfTheInferno">Out of the Inferno</a> moment, but here it's as fireproof as the rest of her — and not even a bit sooty. Also applies to whenever she rides Drogon with only partially braided hair. As any woman with long hair can tell you, it only takes a little bit of wind and a few short seconds to turn those luscious waves into a total rat's nest.
</li><li> In-universe invocation in "The Door". Sansa Stark looks very little the worse for wear despite having been forcibly married to brutal sadist Ramsay Bolton and subjected to rape and torture every night. Because Ramsay was smart about it: there are still enough Stark loyalists left in the North who would rise up in revolt against the Boltons if one of them were seen abusing the daughter of Eddard Stark. So he made sure to never do anything to her face, or to any part of her that would show. What else he might have done to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">is left to the viewer's imagination</a>.
</li><li> In the battle of Castle Black, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pyp</span> is given the very gross death of getting an arrow through the neck and blood splattering everywhere. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ygritte</span> who dies minutes later does so by an arrow through the back, allowing so as not to detract from her actress's beauty. She even makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropDeadGorgeous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropDeadGorgeous">beautiful corpse</a> in the next episode.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Catelyn Stark</span> is also given a much milder death than in the books. There she began clawing at her face, ripping great chunks from her skin and was essentially given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> to put her out of her misery. In the show, she's simply given a slit throat in the closing seconds of the episode.
</li><li> Male example in Jon Snow. Despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExposedToTheElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExposedToTheElements">Exposed to the Elements</a> and away from the chance of a decent wash for pretty much most of the episodes, he always ends up looking quite good. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">Pretty Boy</a> features are never damaged at all — even when in the above-mentioned battle, he gets his head smashed against an anvil and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">Blood from the Mouth</a>, yet no missing teeth.
</li><li> The party of Bran, Rickon, Meera, Jojen, and Osha likewise look very good for people who have spent months travelling through the wilderness. Bran is riding in a wheelbarrow yes but his hair always looks like it's just been washed.
</li><li> Talisa looks very good for someone who's introduced having to amputate a foot. Despite likely being in such situations frequently, she's never covered in too much blood and her hair is only lightly tousled.
</li><li> Arya is shown to have scars from her training with the Faceless Men. None of these are on her face.
</li><li> Arya comes out of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the massacre of King's Landing</span> with nothing more than a light covering of ash, despite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being inside a city that's burned to the ground</span>.

</li><li> In the Season 4 DVDs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, Evangeline Lilly (Kate) laments that her character never gets to look beat up, no matter what damage she appears to take.

Interestingly, Bo is so ridiculously beautiful that even while limping and being covered in cuts, slashes and her own blood from head to toe doesn't detract much from her attractiveness in the first place.

Naturally, the reason is never addressed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Season 4 episode "Delete", Chloe shows absolutely no injury after she has been slammed head-first into walls multiple times, thrown down two flights of stairs and hit by a few of Lana's most vicious kicks, with at least one directly to the face. Oddly, despite Lana's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">The Chick</a> status, she actually had blood on her face when it is over and she definitely isn't beaten as badly as Chloe.
</li><li> In "Spirit", the same thing happened, just worse. Clark <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">possessed by Dawn</span> hits her with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> punch also directly to the face that sends her flying into some metal canisters and she is completely unscathed. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chloe is eventually revealed to have healing powers</span>.
</li><li> In "Persuasion", Chloe and Tess had a brutal fight during which Tess grabs the front of Chloe's coat and punches her in the face repeatedly. Nope, nothing. Not to mention Tess tackled Chloe through a glass table and the latter smashes her with a glass bottle...
</li><li> Green Arrow provides a male example. Late in Season 9, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zod sears his house symbol into Oliver's chest with his heat vision</span>. Later on, in Season 10, he hasn't even got a hint of a scar from it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite the Doctor saying otherwise, Captain Janeway suffered some remarkably mild-looking fire injuries in the episode "Year of Hell" (even her famous red hair is intact). Ironic given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> conclusion (which meant that the producers didn't have to worry about long-term effects) and that <em>Voyager</em> itself is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet">completely trashed</a>.
</li><li> Seven of Nine's famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensualSpandex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensualSpandex">catsuit</a> was justified as a dermaplastic material to cover and heal the injuries from her Borgification. Must have taken her skin a long time to heal, as she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">never stopped wearing it</a>. In addition, while most other Borg have been seen to have had extreme modifications to their faces, the worst Seven gets out of it is a piece of tech permanently affixed around her left eye (although the series does leave it ambiguous as to whether her hair is real, given she was hairless as a Borg).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekPicard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekPicard">Star Trek: Picard</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Nepenthe", Elnor kicks Narissa so hard in the face that she falls down, yet she doesn't have a broken or bleeding nose, a black eye, a loose tooth, or any kind of bruising or blemish <em>whatsoever</em>. The same thing happens in "Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 2" where Seven of Nine punches Narissa a couple of times and the latter then roughly tumbles on to the floor, but Narissa's pretty features remain unscathed.
</li><li> Although this trope normally applies to female characters, Elnor is nevertheless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope">treated no differently</a> than an attractive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> by the showrunners in terms of constantly maintaining his photogenic appearance because he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate">Elfeminate</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairedPrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongHairedPrettyBoy">Long-Haired Pretty Boy</a> who's played by Evan Evagora, an ex-model. In "Broken Pieces", he's punched and kicked in the face several times, but you wouldn't know it from his flawless, injury-free visage.
</li><li> In "Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 2", Narissa smashes Seven of Nine's face against a console. There's a little bit of blood on the side of the latter's mouth, but otherwise, Seven's gorgeousness hasn't been negatively affected.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em>: Steve Harrington getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">the absolute shit beaten out of him</a> and ending up with enormous bloody scars on his face happens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">at least once a season</a>, while his ex-girlfriend Nancy Wheeler hasn't gotten much worse than a <em>shove</em> in three seasons of television.
<ul><li> This is pretty blatant in Season 3. Jonathan &amp; Nancy get attacked by their flayed ex-coworkers from the <em>Post</em> in the hospital, while Steve &amp; Robin get captured and interrogated by Russians opening a gate to the Upside Down beneath the Starcourt Mall. In each boy-girl pair, guess which one is beaten bloody and which one is left basically unharmed?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope">Gender-Inverted</a> on a regular basis. The two pretty boy leads, Sam and Dean, might get beaten up regularly but it's rare to see the effects last even until the end of the episode. Dean even says at one point that coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> erased all his old scars and sorted out his broken fingers. Uh, we've seen your hands, sweetie, they had a lovely manicure. The inversion makes more sense when you remember that <em>Supernatural</em> is targeting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstrogenBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstrogenBrigade">very different audience</a> than most of the shows on this list.
</li><li> There's also a Season 3 episode where a young woman who has been in a coma since the age of eight appears to have spent the entire time lying peacefully in her hospital bed, with perfect hair and a full face of makeup.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Castiel</a> joins the cast, he continues the trend, as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> ensures no scars. He eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">starts healing Sam and Dean</a> on occasion, making their pretty faces make a little more sense.
</li></ul></li><li> Noticeable to some extent in the later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em>. While both men and women show many of the expected effects of primitive living for a month, the men almost always have visible stubble and clearly grungy hair, while the women almost never have leg stubble and their hair often seems much cleaner.

Her boots caught Lita above the eye, cutting her a little. Sensing the potential to make the match more exciting, she deliberately targeted the wound in order to make it bleed more.

The fact that Lita already had a hardcore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">Tomboy</a> image probably made the folks backstage more comfortable with it.

</li><li> Parodied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">Cody Rhodes</a> in 2011, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> kicked him in the nose at the tail end of his "Absolutely Dashing" gimmick.

</li><li> Blading had long been a popular way to insert drama into a match — where the wrestlers would hide razor blades in their gear and cut themselves to escalate the violence of the match. While men and women did this in most places where pro wrestling occurred to various degrees, women in WWE never bladed, because that would have detracted from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a>. The blood mentioned above was accidental.
</li><li> Eventually men in rated pg WWE were barred from blading too, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> getting fined 100,000 USD for doing so. Medical glue was also adopted to "instantly" close wounds, but this wound up nearly ruining matches, such as a ladder match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWorldsGreatestTagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWorldsGreatestTagTeam">Shelton Benjamin</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> resorted to opening up wrestlers the hard way, but he had little finesse and ended up making people look <em>worse</em>.
</li><li> Behind the scenes, the Divas had to resort to lots of hacks and tricks so that the bruises and scrapes they got from wrestling most of the week wouldn't show up on TV. Strategically applied make-up would take care of the face, while most women resorted to weaves and extensions to prevent their hair from getting too damaged. Likewise their gear was secured with lots of double-sided tape to prevent any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction">Wardrobe Malfunction</a> (or revealing too many body bruises).

<ul><li> Part of Tifa's backstory is Sephiroth slashing her across the torso with his giant sword. You'd think this would leave a pretty noticeable scar, right? Nope, she recovers from it just fine with no ill-effects whatsoever. She spends the whole game in a tank top. Pity she never taught Aeris her secret, isn't it?
</li><li> Perhaps she did — when Aeris gets stabbed, there's not a trace of blood, and while she looks shocked and in pain at first she dies with a smile on her face (as Cloud observes in dialogue later). Her hair comes undone, but this is just so her hair can romantically billow out around her beautiful corpse as her body sinks into the water. This is especially notable considering that Aeris's death was an attempt to write a non-beautiful, emotionally realistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath">Plotline Death</a>.

Even right at the very end when Zack is murdered and both young men are covered in mud and blood, the amount of blood is extremely limited and their hair still looks great, instead just looking attractively smudged up.

</li><li> Sylvanas Windrunner from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> series. Once a beautiful High Elf, she put up a heroic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Arthas</a> when he invaded Quel'Thalas. Arthas rewarded her for her trouble by having her brutally tortured, then killing her and turning her into a banshee. Her corpse was left to rot for what was presumably an extended period of time before banshee Sylvanas eventually broke free of Arthas' grasp and possessed it. Despite all this, she's still depicted as beautiful in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">Evil Is Sexy</a> sort of way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeathlyPallor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeathlyPallor">Her skin is now blue</a> and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">eyes red</a>, but there's no visible scarring or decomposition. As mentioned below, it seems this is a feature of high ranking undead.
<ul><li> The Broken Isles loading screen shows Sylvanas Windrunner fighting demons on the Broken Shore aside Varian Wrynn. Varian's armor is damaged and he has several bloody cuts on his face, but Sylvanas is, of course, completely spotless.
</li><li> Death Knights are similar, the time between your character's death and revival is left unstated, but you're not terribly decomposed unless you choose one of the three skins made specifically with rot in mind.
</li><li> Exaggerated with Derek Proudmoore in <em>Battle for Azeroth.</em> In the second war, Derek was incinerated by a dragon when sailing at sea(pre-retcon, his body was turned to ash), his corpse sinking to the bottom of sea where it would remain for over <strong>thirty</strong> years. Yet when found and resurrected as a weapon by the forsaken, Derek's corpse is not only not a bloated mess from decades under the sea, but inexplicably in pristine condition outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeathlyPallor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeathlyPallor">Undeathly Pallor</a>. Especially notable as a fellow soldier found with Derek, was in poor condition with bones sticking out their body just like all other forsaken.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/YoJinBo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/YoJinBo">Yo-Jin-Bo</a></em> allows main characters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofFashionPlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofFashionPlate">both genders</a> to avoid so much as a scratch in art. Despite running from ninjas through a forest, Sayori doesn't ever rip her kimono or get sweaty or anything. In fact, after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode">hot spring</a>, Jin even comments on how lovely girls smell after they get out of the bath...despite the fact that her clothes were not washed and thus should <em>stink</em>. She does break a sandal strap once, but that's only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry">so Bo could carry her</a>. And even when the guys are said to be injured in text, it only rarely shows up as blood spatter in the art.
</li><li> Resident damsel Ashley Graham in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> fits this bill, as while she is vulnerable to many attacks that hit Leon, she doesn't bleed or show any damage when hit. And while Leon has many death animations assigned to him Ashley tends to use the same death animation when killed by the same attacks. Miss Graham does have her own two unique death animations that not even the other female character Ada shares but do not show much physical damage. The first is having a giant rock fall on her during Leon's second fight with El Gigante, but in this instance she isn't shown at all and her other unique death animation is a neck snap by a zealot when she fails to escape being strangled in time before her HP runs out. Her Physical appearance does not change in this instance (aside from a dangling body) and her enemy simply proceeds to toss her corpse over his shoulder as the enemy does with the AI Ashley.
</li><li> Naturally in Fanservice game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RumbleRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RumbleRoses">Rumble Roses</a></em>, the girls can be whipped, kicked in the nose, and have their joints manipulated in superhuman ways but no matter how much damage they receive they never show any physical injury aside from just holding the area most damaged when damage is high, though this damaged area doesn't affect their ability to fight. A notable example is Anesthesia who shocks her opponent's bellies with a medical AED for the girls that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff">have the area exposed</a> and take the shock straight to the skin they do not show any damage afterwards to the area either.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros</a>.</em> Male characters typically snore when put to sleep, none of the girls do and typically just make more pleasant idle noises. In their defeated poses while they clap all of the girls are also shown taking their loss rather well and bare no ill will but some of the males like Bowser look rather unpleased and refuses to face the camera and Wario seemingly hurls insults towards his opponents. When screen ko'ed a lot of the men are shown as if their face is being pressed against the screen while the girls are just shown looking cutesy in front of the screen before going away.
