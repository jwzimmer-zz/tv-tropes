</p><p>Why did we have the first half of each story again? It was All for Nothing.
</p><p>Sometimes, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> completely destroys the point of an earlier arc in the same story. It could contradict the early story's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">message</a>, or it could reveal that the events we cared about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">never happened</a> or weren't what they seemed. A hero's decisions don't seem so heroic if it turns out that they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">manipulated</a> every step of the way. And if a character goes through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, their earlier stories become irrelevant when we know they'll disavow it all.
</p><p>This trope can be used to set a story on the cynical end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>  nothing lasts forever, and something that seems so important may be just a passing moment. Yes, the farm boy may have risen to become king and gotten the girl, but his life doesn't end there, and things can still go downhill. Another use for this is to deliberately shock the audience  a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> hurts so much when the character we cheered for six seasons turns on us.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: This is the worst part of being an Apostle. It doesn't fix anything, it only changes the subject after reaching the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> in the short time, since as many Apostles can attest (for instance, The Count still loves her daughter, Rosine realizes too late the God Hand never granted her wish to become an elf and Ganishka is still paranoid as ever), but that doesn't mean they won't reach it again. In fact, things gets worse since a dying Apostle will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedOffToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedOffToHell">Dragged Off to Hell</a> by their victims eventually.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the first saga of the series, Yamcha, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Krillin all train in order to be able to combat the incoming Saiyans. Soon as Vegeta and Nappa get there and they, along with Gohan and Piccolo engage the two. Yamcha is blow up in a sneak attack by one of the man-made henchmen, the Saibamen. Chaiotzu ends up blowing himself up in vain to trying to kill Nappa. And Tien ends up losing an arm and using up all his energy just trying to take Nappa out... which also fails. And Krillin ends up being pretty damn useless as well, as Nappa punishes him and Gohan. So all that training was for naught. This repeats itself on the Android Arc, where the humans ultimately realize how underpowered they are compared to each new foe that appears. As a result, they give up on fighting... or at least Yamcha and Chiaotzu do.
</li><li> During the Buu Saga, Vegeta becomes so obsessed with topping Goku that he makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Babidi</a>, allowing Babidi to turn him into a Majin and bring forth his inner evil to do so. As it turns out, Goku had unlocked Super Saiyan 3 and had been holding back against Majin Vegeta the whole time, so Vegeta sold his soul to Babidi, forsook his family, friends, and own convictions, and helped unleash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Majin Buu</a> upon the world for <em>nothing</em>. More than that, the very thing he did all of the above actions for, his pride, was utterly and completely destroyed. Not only were his sacrifices meaningless, he once again has to deal with the fact that Goku made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">huge leap ahead of him by unlocking Super Saiyan 3</a>, to say nothing of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">insult of being allowed to think he could win.</a> As a result, Vegeta is pretty damn pissed with Goku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectedForAJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectedForAJob">when King Yemma brings him back to fight Buu</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">after he gave his life in a failed effort to make amends</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Vegeta:</strong> I sent myself into a cold oblivion, and I did it on a lie!
</div></li><li> This is not the first time this happened to Vegeta. In the Frieza Saga, he spent the majority of the story arc avoiding a direct conflict with the titular tyrant, while using subterfuge and quick action to take the Namekian Dragon Balls for himself and pick off his men, reaching the brink of death more than once, so that he can use the Dragon Balls to wish for immortality, and so that he can finally challenge him. Unfortunately, the Grand Elder, whose life sustains the usage of the magical orbs dies, and Frieza confronts him and his erstwhile allies, Krillin and Gohan. Seeing no other choice, they battle him head-on, but it's not enough. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GondorCallsForAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GondorCallsForAid">Piccolo is revived and brought to Namek</a>, and he turns the tables against Frieza at first, but it quickly becomes clear that the battle is still a losing one. So Vegeta, in an attempt to become a Super Saiyan, has Krillin put him to the brink of death and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Dende revive him</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">so he can receive a dramatic power boost</a>. It works, but Frieza still toys with him, and he loses all hope when he realizes he's not a Super Saiyan, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">a savage beatdown by Frieza's hands</a> before he executes him. Everything he did in that arc was to free himself from the yoke of Frieza, and it all it earned him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">was a pitiful death</a>. At least he got better by the arc's end.
</li><li> Said word-for-word in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZKai">Dragon Ball Z Kai</a></em> by Piccolo upon seeing Frieza's true form. After all the training he did with King Kai, and everything Gohan and Krillin went through to get Namek's Dragon Balls to revive him... he states to Gohan that he can no longer protect him. Not from Frieza.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> has an "All For Nothing Saga" in the form of the Future Trunks Saga. Basically, the entire reason it happened is because the heroes tried to fight off this new threat in the form of Goku Black and Future Zamasu, and saved Future Trunks' timeline and survivors of their attack. So after 20 episodes of mystery-solving and fighting what happens? Merged Zamasu becomes a bodiless form who succeeds in killing off <em>every single survivor</em> that the heroes fought so hard to protect, and begins the process of spreading across the entire multiverse and timelines. This forces the heroes to summon Future Zen-Oh, who has to completely erase Future Trunks' entire timeline from existence, just to finish off Future Zamasu once and for all. And Future Trunks and Future Mai are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivors</a> of that timeline. That's right, all their efforts they worked so hard to protect the timeline ended up being completely <em>meaningless,</em> and they couldn't even meet their friends in the afterlife because it's also blown up. The only compensation for all this is the fact that Zamasu was stopped before he managed to spread to other timelines. That, and Whis can send Trunks and Mai back to a time just before Goku Black came into being, allowing Future Trunks to prevent it all from happening in the first place.
<ul><li> The manga version had it even worse. Least in the anime they managed to killed Merged Zamasu's main form. In this version, nope, they cut him in half... and he just makes multiple copies of himself. Meaning there's no way they can even defeat him because he's just too overpowered. It's only due to Goku remembering he had Zen-Oh's button that saves them.
</li></ul></li><li> On the flip-side, this also applies to Zamasu himself in that he finally succeeded in killing of all the mortals in the timeline and managed to have a whole universe shaped in his vision upon gaining his bodiless form. But by that time, he has completely lost his mind, which means that he will never be able to enjoy it. His victory is also negated when Future Zen-Oh appears and eradicates the timeline he resides in, with the knowledge that he couldn't kill the people who caused him the most grief.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jellal spent years before the start of the series up to the Tower of Heaven arc manipulating Erza, his childhood friends/fellow slaves, and even the Magic Council itself in order to prepare the R-System for the process of reviving the black wizard Zeref after being possessed by his spirit as a child. He tormented Erza, destroyed countless lives, and even killed one of his friends Simon in the name of obtaining "true freedom." The kicker? Even if he hadn't been defeated by Natsu and Erza, it wouldn't have mattered because <em>Zeref was never dead in the first place.</em> His "possession" was really the result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashing spell</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Ultear</a> who was manipulating him for a plan by her own dark guild to unseal Zeref and to take the Council's eyes off their movements. He becomes a wanted criminal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">loses his memories</a>, gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">death wish</a> upon learning what he did, and it was all based on a lie.

Nobody's amused. Shinji teams up with Kaworu because he's the only one who still show him kindness, and tries to fix everything. He loses him too and <em>partially triggers Fourth Impact</em>. So now Shinji has destroyed the world, lost Rei, only saved Asuka (whose every second in existence is sheer suffering and hatred towards Shinji) and another step in Gendo's hidden agenda is completed. At this rate, you can expect Shinji to rip apart what is left of his dignity and sanity and eventually destroy the entire universe.

Charly is so hurt and angry that she joins a militant black faction, the Black Powers, and even adds Randy's name to a list of racists the gang intends to beat up. A few issues later, they reconcile and become friends again. Over the next dozen issues, they experience adventures together, share many happy moments, and even seem to be moving toward becoming a couple after all. But after Randy becomes trapped inside his dark antibody, Charly begins avoiding him. In Issue 31, Randy confronts her about it and Charly bluntly tells him that they had been the two normal-looking ones in their old therapy group, but now that he was trapped inside his antibody, he could no longer pass for normal. When Randy asks if they're no longer friends because of his appearance, Charly reminds him that he did the same to her. She tells him that she is rejecting him the same way he rejected her, and leaves. It's as if everything Randy and Charly shared with each other in the time since his rejection of her doesn't count for anything. One would think that the fact that Randy and Charly had <em>saved each other's lives</em> more than once would at least be enough to sustain a friendship, but apparently not. Because there was very little direct contact between Randy and Charly in the next (and last) issue of the series, the reader is never told whether Randy and Charly ever resolved their differences.

This eventually culminates in the Red Wedding, where he has Robb and Catelyn Stark and most of their bannermen murdered while they were under guest right. Considered his greatest triumph, it's after that everything begins to fall apart. First, Jaime refuses to leaves the Kingsguard and carry on the family name, then Cersei reveals his aforementioned legacy is nothing more than a lie by confirming the rumors about her and Jaime are true, and then Tyrion outright murders him after being put through a sham-trial that was meant to end in Tyrion's death, unable to take his father's emotional abuse anymore. Once Tywin dies, that's when everything <em>really</em> goes downhill: the Tyrell alliance he painstakingly tried to maintain crumbles after Cersei blows the Great Sept of Baelor sky high with wildfire, killing Margaery, Loras, and Mace, along with Tywin's brother Kevan. This sees Tommen commit suicide and Cersei taking the Iron Throne for herself in a desperate bid to stave off the inevitable retaliation. The Starks he had seemingly wiped out and defeated have retaken Winterfell, and then Daenerys Targaryen lands in Westeros, dragons and all. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All of that eventually leads to Jaime and Cersei dying in Daenerys's inevitable attack on King's Landing, leaving Tyrion, the son he despised, as the last remaining Lannister.

Even then, he couldn't have possibly harmed any of the people left on the Island, as those were stuck in a completely different <em>time period</em>. Sorry, Hurley, the Lie was All For Nothing.
</li><li> Could be argued that most of the characters' storylines became All For Nothing at various points through season 6, the writers just killing them off seemingly without a care for any kind of subplot they still had going on. Probably worst of all when Sun spends almost a season and a half returning to the island and finding Jin so they can return to their daughter before both simply drown.
</li><li> John Locke's entire story arc also seemingly turned out to be All For Nothing, as he was simply a pawn in The Man In Black's game all along. However, Locke's life and death did had one major consequence: he had finally managed to convince Jack of the truth of his beliefs, thus allowing all the events of the last two seasons to happen.

Hawthorne is able to collect films from alternate worlds, including a few where the Allies won. Finding out, the Nazis put together a massive machine designed to cross over to these other worlds. In the season 3 finale, Commander Smith tells a captive Hawthorne that the Nazis have tested the device with three "volunteers" exploding and a fourth vanishing. They are now going to use it to invade and conquer other Earths. Hawthrone smugly tells Smith this won't work for one simple reason: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A person can only cross over into another reality if their counterpart in that world is already dead.

</li><li> In one ep, Potter was delighted by an accidentally-delivered can of tomato juice, something he hasn't had in a long while. Radar wants to get him a whole case, so he, Hawkeye and BJ engage in a load of horse-trading and just plain grief to acquire it. When they get their goods, Potter reveals that he remembered why he had gone so long without tomato juice - he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotAllergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotAllergy">horribly allergic</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>. At the inception of the series, a teenaged Merlin comes to Camelot and is made Arthur's manservant, being told repeatedly by a prophetic dragon that the two of them have a great destiny together: to unite Albion, to legalize magic, and to usher in the Golden Age. <em>It never comes to pass</em>. After five seasons, which amounts to ten in-show years, Arthur <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies at Mordred's hands before any of this can occur</span>. Unless you count the brief three years of Arthur and Guinevere's reign that happened entirely off-screen in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between series 4 and 5 (in which Merlin is still a lowly servant and the druids and other magic-users still have to live in hiding), everything that Merlin ever worked, waited and hoped for comes to naught. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though given that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> shows that Merlin is still around, and Arthur is traditionally the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain">King in the Mountain</a>...</span>
</li><li> More than once on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></em>, the killer discovers too late that the motive for the murder (from a supposed payday to winning over someone's love) either never existed or isn't what they expect. A key example is "Night of the Coyote." A man kills a rancher to find the location of a lockbox stolen by bandits a century before. He finally digs it up, expecting gold or silver. Instead, he finds it's filled with bonds...for a company that went bankrupt in 1905.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a></em> have made several very complicated myth setups, only for them to completely blow up in their faces.
<ul><li> A giant Lego ball that took hours of work of about a dozen people to make, after getting both all the blocks from Lego Land and the largest private collector, completely broke apart before it even made it halfway down the setup track.

</li></ul></li><li> When they attempted to retest the JATO Rocket Car myth from their pilot episode, they wanted to give it the best possible chance of actually getting airborne, so they pulled out all the stops: spending a lot of money on a "real" rocket (instead of their original homemade version), building and reinforcing a massive ramp, installing remote controls and elaborate tow-lines so it could be launched safely. After all that effort and expense, their professionally-built rocket engine exploded when it was ignited. This was perhaps the only time since the first season that they couldn't give a verdict of "busted", "plausible", or "confirmed". As this was the "Supersized Special", they ended up calling the myth "appropriately supersized"; after all, they'd still gotten a consolatory fireball.
</li></ul></li><li> A version of this trope that actually favors the protagonists occurs in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em>. A billionaire businessman conspires to rig California's election system, and then starts killing anyone who could implicate him. While the businessman is able to avoid arrest, the investigation results in the scheme being made public, thus ensuring that it won't succeed.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> shows that no matter what you did in the previous entry, the Curse was never really stopped, only held back until the fire starts to fade again. You've come to Drangleic looking for some way to cure yourself of the Curse of undeath, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and while you do get a treatment for it if you complete the Lost Crowns Trilogy in the form of the ancient crowns of the Sunken King of Shulva, the Old Iron King, the Ivory King of Eleum Loyce, and Vendrick's own crown, you ultimately come to the conclusion hat no matter what you do there is no cure, and you can only hope to propagate the cycle of Light and Dark long enough that someone else will find a way to cure it long after you're gone. If you completed the Scholar of the First Sin content, then you can make it a little less futile by refusing to ascend the Throne of Want and instead trying to find another way out of the cycle, but Aldia states that this is a fool's hope at best.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> seemingly subverts this in all of its endings, as the game implies that the Age of Fire can't be saved and it is going to end no matter what you do. All you can do is choose how it dies: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You can either Link the Fire one last time, giving the world a spark of light to go out on. You can have the Firekeeper snuff it out so that a natural flame can take its place out of the Age of Dark. Or you can consume the First Flame itself and use its powers along with the Dark Soul to break the Curse and rise as the new Lord of the Age of Dark.</span>
<ul><li> Then we get to the Ringed City DLC, which really shows just how pointless this whole mess with the Fire and the Dark really was: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Dark was never supposed to be malevolent, it was only made that way when Gwyn (paranoid as he was) placed a seal of fire on mankind. This act cut off their natural affinity for the peaceful Dark in the souls, and as they lost control over their own Dark the Abyss and Humanity itself grew malevolent and chaotic, leading to the Curse itself. If Gwyn hadn't been paranoid about the Dark, every single problem in the whole series could've been avoided.</span>

If you decide to remain loyal to the Guardians, you will uncover various things about the Drifter's past, mainly because the man decides to help you discover it, claiming he has nothing to hide. You eventually discover his hideout and investigate it, only in end to be told that there is no evidence against the Drifter that shows he is guilty of anything and the investigation was pointless. The only things that change is the info about the Drifter fills up a lore completion segment,(which details how the probe was pointless) and you still get to do the Gambit co-op modes, but Drifter doesn't trust you anymore, occasionally calling the player a snitch.

They fight their way through the corrupted cathedral, crumbling catacombs, dark caverns, and ultimately into Hell itself. Upon defeating Diablo, the Warrior plunges the crystal holding Diablo's soul into his own head, volunteering for an eternity of torment as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">can for this ancient evil attempting to break free</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> reveals that the Rogue was corrupted by Andarial and destroyed the monastery her people call home, the Sorceror went mad and retreated to a pocket dimension of his own making, and the Warrior (now identified canonically as Prince Aiden) wasn't strong enough to hold Diablo, and had handed the Lord of Terror a much stronger host than the 10-year-old boy he'd been inhabiting in the first game. When Diablo escaped the cathedral, he burned Tristram on his way out, slaughtering everyone who lived there, leaving Deckard Cain as the only survivor.

<ul><li> Ironically, it's not that pointless; DLC reveals that some of the Collectors were stranded from their base when it exploded, and it's implied that the intel helped them integrate with the alliance.

<ul><li> Additionally, forcing the two groups to make peace (essentially allowing them to rebuild the Quarian homeworld together) is essentially rendered moot if one picks the "Destroy" option at the game's end (as all of the geth are destroyed, anyway).
</li><li> You can go <em>further</em> and wipe out both civilizations, turning Rannoch into a wasteland. And in the worst ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you set all Mass Relays to self-destruct, ending the Reapers but nuking galactic civilization back to the (cultural) dark ages</span>.

</li></ul></li><li> A lot of angst for all characters comes from the knowledge that everything the Protheans did to win their war ultimately failed to prevent their extinction, and that there is every chance the same thing would happen in their cycle.

</li><li> A bit of a running theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">Uncharted</a></em>, where Nate walks away with either nothing, very little or even losing something valuable of his (assuming you don't count him picking up the Treasure collectibles). A consistent trope is that he <em>never</em> gets thing he spent the whole game searching for, although he's more about the chase than the reward. Walking away from an expedition with no treasure and just a clue to a new location also pushes the characters into feeling this way about things.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedDrakesFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedDrakesFortune">Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</a></em>, Nate initially has nothing by the end and intentionally left his ring with Sir Francis. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> when it's revealed that Elena recovered the ring for him and Sully stole a boat from the pirates who stockpiled a crate full of Spanish gold.

<ul><li> This also turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the fate of Libertalia. Henry Avery intended it to be a utopia for pirates to live without society's rules.The problem being, a society made up of people who rob and plunder for a living was doomed from the start.
