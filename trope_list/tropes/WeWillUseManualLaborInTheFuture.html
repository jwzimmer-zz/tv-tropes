Why mining? Because cave sets are cheap and easily redressed to represent different planets. However, we have to ask ourselves why such technologically advanced civilizations (presumably capable of building automated robot mines) choose to be so dependent on manual labour as to indenture or enslave thousands, even millions of sapient beings instead of applying technological solutions which are cheaper, stronger, more efficient, tireless, more humane and less rebellious.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes the trope is justified by slaves or servants symbolizing social prestige, but in societies that are supposed to the technological near-equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> or whatever outfit the heroes belong to, it comes as a bit surprising that interstellar polities so frequently appear dependent on menial and dangerous labour conditions with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">No OSHA Compliance</a>  and if they represent social prestige, why aren't they on display, as servants, maids, entertainers or sex slaves? Items of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">Conspicuous Consumption</a> aren't conspicuous if they are hidden away in a mine.
</p><p>For what it's worth, there are <em>some</em> benefits to slavery which could explain its use in a futuristic setting. There are some jobs (namely skilled, management and service work) which are just too complex for any currently envisioned mechanical technology to do without some human assistance. What makes this trope appear blatant and unable to suspend disbelief is that futuristic slavery rarely involves these environments, but rather dangerous hard labour such as mining, repetitive industrial work and space construction work. In these environments, slaves are way too soft and inconvenient to provide for because of the biological fact that they get exhausted and need to sleep (and in Sci Fi space labour you have to invest in highly expensive and complex life-support biospheres for every single slave, defeating the purpose of cheap labour in the first place), and they also have much more dangerous intelligence and machinery at their disposal. A disgruntled slave who's a mad scientist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">MacGyver-style</a> improviser or C4 expert (or even one with just a pickaxe) is substantially more dangerous than one who works primarily with a hoe (not that you should write the latter guys off if you've got them in a pinch either  isn't that right, oppressors of the peasant caste in the ancient Far East?)
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Part of the reason for this is that the evil being portrayed usually isn't the slavery itself, but the emphasis on punishment which the workers must endure. Many "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag">The Gulag</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">in Space</a>" examples are more about punishment than economic efficiency. In Sci-Fi, you can identify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> or any other villainous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">dystopia</a> through their use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenalColony">Space Gulags</a>. In modern-day society, we have machines that are quite capable of automatically pressing license plates for free, but prisoners are the iconic way to do it.
</p><p>This trope can potentially be justified for the same reason many industrial processes that could be automated are not. The time, cost, maintenance, and effort for completely automated systems can quite often be far in excess of what skilled labour can have. Automated systems often have a fairly limited lifespan, and the cost of building, maintaining, and replacement is occasionally ludicrously high, thus slave labour or labour that borders on slavery is used in lieu of automation because it's often actually cheaper provided the workers are from a poor country populated by species with a higher fertility rate and physical fortitude but much lower average IQ and life support costs than the country their masters or employers are from.
</p><p>If the manual workers are not slaves but the normal population of a civilization, one fictional reason sometimes given is the ethics of dignity of work. There are very few places there a human is mandatory to do work. Generations of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLuddite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLuddite">Evil Luddite</a> argue that if too much is automated, most people are unemployed. This is a reason why some people oppose industrialization. The consensus of actual economists is that while automation may displace some specific workers temporarily, in the long run it simply frees them up to perform more productive work. Thus in the Star Trek Federation, the replicator doesn't make people totally obsolete, but instead allows them to spend their time doing something more productive or more fun than manufacturing common goods.
</p><p>In addition, the amount of effort to build certain types of quality control is either not possible, absurdly difficult, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">downright dangerous</a>. Occupiers may also use the local population instead of slaughtering them, in the hope that the workers' presence will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">deter</a> an all-out counter attack. Another common and logical way to justify the use of slaves is through presenting the history and dangers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I. Is a Crapshoot</a>, the reason why future civilizations want to avoid automation. A rogue AI can hijack automated systems with impunity, but individuals are easier to identify and kill when they get too loud.
</p><p>Thus, this trope isn't about future slavery; it's more about any instances about using manual labour even though people in the series already have something that would be quicker, easier, more efficient, and/or overall better. A common yet rarely understood example is ubiquitous presence of characters upon ships capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>  why stock and crew a starship when one can simply send an <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft">automated probe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>? Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple">it's hard to tell entertaining stories about automated probes</a>. This is a big reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> space development <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack">holds few people's interest</a>.
</p><p>As well, beware of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels">Technology Levels</a>; just because a civilization can travel in space <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfJesusThenAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfJesusThenAliens">doesn't mean</a> they actually <em>have</em> servitor robots. But the series that have already shown automation yet refuse to use it in the obvious places don't have any excuse. This is perhaps the ultimate extension of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a>. Compare with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack">I Want My Jet Pack</a>, and compare <em>and</em> contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobStealingRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobStealingRobot">Job-Stealing Robot</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note081i9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note081i9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note081i9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Aversions of this trope may fit better there as well.</span>

However unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlienNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlienNation">Alien Nation</a></em> they're genetically altered to NEED to be slaves. Depriving them of their built-in desire to be slaves causes a lot of friction between them and their hosts (currently humans). May be justified in that Ren is genetically programmed to have sex with her master as soon as she detects he's 'in the mood' (they're also blindingly gorgeous) so much of the reason for their creation could be sexual.

It's not just butlers and maids either, vast armies of robots are used as slave labor to haul vast building materials as a robot foreman beats on a drum to keep the workers in time. The Machines in 01 have production lines to build various items for both internal use and export. The main factor in this story is that it comes from the Zion archives and told by The Instructor, a program who interprets the archive's knowledge, so much of the knowledge of the past is to be taken with a grain of salt.

On most all other worlds, such work is done by robots, although in the same continuity the planet of Orando is governed by a ruling class of giant snake people and labor is done by a second-class citizenry of raccoon people.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, one of the most valuable materials in the world <em>must</em> be mined by hand.

One the one hand, in the cities of the world, robots are so effective for so many things that unemployment rarely dips below 85%, causing mass boredom, which in turn leads to massive crime levels. Conversely, penal servitude in the Cursed Earth is a fairly common penalty, and is commonly meted out to those who smash robots in order to be able to work. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHellOfATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHellOfATime">That type of criminal tends to jump at the opportunity to get back to work.</a>

This being a bad idea is kind of the whole point of the film.

Most of what they do would probably be computerized nowadays, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">said computers weren't around in 1926</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moon">Moon</a></em> neatly averts this trope, featuring a vast lunar mining facility staffed by exactly ONE human, who mostly serves as a troubleshooter for the automated systems. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is, however, essentially a slave himself, and cloned to boot</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Wookiees and Mon Calamari are enslaved by the Empire, but given the Empire's formidable military-industrial infrastructure, the omnipresence of droids, and the latter species' unusual physiology, alien slavery in the Empire makes little practical sense. (Droid slavery, on the other hand...) It seems slavery in the <em>Star Wars</em> verse is largely a policy intended to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">humiliate and degrade acceptable targets</a>, when it isn't a cover for genocide (any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">parallels with Nazi Germany</a> are probably intentional). Organic slaves are also seen a status symbol, but that's more for, er, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGoEnslavement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGoEnslavement">personal</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGoEnslavement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGoEnslavement">needs</a>.
</li><li> Wookiees and Mon Calamari are described as being favored for slave labour due to their strength, dexterity, creativity, and intuitive understanding of mechanics and electronics, making them ideal for engineering work. In addition, the prequels reveal that the Wookiees helped Yoda escape Kashyyyk; Palpatine might have decided to enslave them as punishment. It is also implied that the main customers of the slave trade are from worlds which <em>don't</em> have access to advanced technologies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo">Solo</a></em> shows the Kessel spice mines canonically and the first time onscreen. Both organic slaves and droids are used. It's unstated, but probably they use organic slaves where they're cheaper than droids, or can work more easily in the tunnels, like the old EU had it.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em> series has humans being rounded up and used for slave labor by Skynet in the post-Judgment Day future. Most noted among their uses for slaves was forcing captured humans to throw corpses into furnaces. The reasons for using humans rather than automated systems are never made quite clear, though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation">fourth film</a> implies that Skynet is doing it purely out of malice, as it already has plenty of automated production lines.
</li><li> Surprisingly averted in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990">Total Recall (1990)</a></em>, as this film's actual heavy mining is only seen being performed by machines. Although this begs the question of just what those downtrodden masses whom the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> villain exploits, and the rebels are fighting to liberate, are doing at a Martian mining outpost, in the first place...
<ul><li> It's possible they were a useful workforce earlier during the "setting things up" phase and some combination of bad contracts, unanticipated level of reproduction, and passenger transport turning out less profitable than projected meant when they finally should have been paid off, left and retired, they (and their descendants) ended up stuck instead.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUnearthly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUnearthly">The Unearthly</a></em> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarradine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarradine">John Carradine</a> horror movie that was once featured on MST3K), a mad scientist has a bunch of caveman-like mutant rejects in one basement room, most of whom are apparently pushing a large electric turbine around in a circle, like the giant mill that Conan the Barbarian had to push when he was a slave. Not a terribly efficient source of power, all things considered, but at least he's putting his rejects to work!

The very first chapter is about the precedent that prevents artificial intelligences and uploads from being treated as property. One protagonist is a male submissive; his daughter sells herself into slavery to herself to get away from her mother, taking advantage of a loophole in Islamic law. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the alien and later human-made sentient corporations use minds as a currency</span>. But manual labour itself is more or less entirely obsolete, what with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">The Singularity</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em> uses the lower (read: intentionally retarded) castes to perform manual labor, and has even perfected technology to create multiple clones of the same human being (with the stated reason to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">ensure consistency</a>). They have stopped developing technologies and need a large consumer base - both of which are to ensure societal stability. Of course, one reason they stopped developing technology was so that the lower castes would not be put out of work. (One of the characters <em>claims</em> that they'd tried a settling a fully-automated island with only the ruling class Alphas, as an experiment, and it collapsed into civil war within a year because they all wanted to be on top, while an experiment with giving people more leisure time in Ireland caused an overuse of the government-issued pleasure drug soma and general unrest since they had idle hands.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCavesOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCavesOfSteel">The Caves of Steel</a></em>, a major source of contention between Earthlings and the Spacers (former planet colonists from Earth, now rebelled) is the refusal of Earth to <em>stop</em> using manual labor. Robots could do all the work better, faster and safer for only a fraction of the cost, and are one of the key reasons for the utopian societies of the Spacers, but their introduction to Earth society is being resisted (sometimes violently) because they will displace so much of the human workforce. In the <em>Foundation</em> series (thousands of years later in the same 'verse) the descendants of the galaxy spanning human diaspora still rely on human labor; the Spacer colonies and their descendants settled into decadence and crippling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility">Creative Sterility</a>, never expanding further and eventually being forgotten.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfSteel">Children of Steel</a></em> novels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">animorphs</a> are identured to the companies that create them for 50 years or until they manage to earn enough to pay the multi-million credit cost of their gestation and education. Or they die considering they tend to work in hazardous jobs. The Egypt-themed planet Pharoah goes so far as to practice outright slavery.
</li><li> John Peel's young adult series <em>Diadem: Worlds of Magic</em> shows us Pixel's homeworld of Calomir. Residents live in fully automated houses with robotic servants and spend most of their time in a virtual world similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReadyPlayerOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReadyPlayerOne">Ready Player One</a></em>. When he leaves his house one day (which he has never done before), he comes across a slave labor camp, where he is told that they make everything that those in houses consume.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em>.
<ul><li> Justified in that after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Butlerian Jihad</a>, complex autonomous machines are forbidden for millennia. Even regular old <em>calculators</em> are replaced by (highly-paid) people called Mentats.
</li><li> Most of these are Buddislamic slaves "harvested" from primitive worlds. The justification: their ancestors refused to fight machines, so the descendants have to pay the price. Even more, they should be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">happy</a></em> to do their part.
</li><li> Even the Ixians, whose entire planet is a giant underground machine factory (they are the ones who build the enormous Guild heighliners) use throngs of suboids, a specially-bred race of humans mostly incapable of independent thought. This is considering that factory machines like the ones we have don't need to have complex computer "brains", which is what they're really afraid of.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">Omnius</a> in the prequels chooses to use human slaves instead of the more efficient machines, although that seems more of a status thing (i.e. putting humans below it).
</li></ul></li><li> In Jerry Pournelle's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FalkenbergsLegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FalkenbergsLegion">Falkenberg's Legion</a></em> series and its spinoffs, the colonized planets generally have little or no industry or infrastructure, and the CoDominium keeps shipping convicts and dissidents to them whether they like it or not. In particular, Haven, Tanith, Frystaat, Thurstone, Arrarat, Hadley, and Sparta all have a permanent underclass, with degrees of unfreedom ranging from "can't vote" to "outright property".
</li><li> A variant in the 1958 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> short story "The Feeling of Power", set long after even the most basic mathematics were delegated to computers and forgotten. After a technician reinvents pen-and-paper math, the Terrestrial Federation plans to replace the computer guidance systems in its missiles with human-piloted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">Suicide Attacks</a>, since it's cheaper for them to teach a human to calculate trajectories than to build a computer that can.
</li><li> In Rick Griffin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HayvenCelestia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HayvenCelestia">Hayven Celestia</a></em> the krakun have colonized numerous star systems and enslaved many species.

Jakari, one of the crew, acknowledges that the use of living slaves makes sense for deep space work since they can't be hacked, but on seeing their commissioner have slaves bathe her thinks that seems excessively decadent.
</li><li> Subverted with humans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfTheGalaxy">The History of the Galaxy</a></em> books, who strive to computerize anything and everything. In fact, at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> creates new colonies by sending a completely-automated factory. Human workers are only added in later stages to oversee the operation and expansion. Played straight with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople">Insects</a>, who had highly-advanced technology <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">3 million years ago</a> but have never had the need to develop complex machines due to their enormous work force, which is created by artificially de-evolving intelligent members of their race into mindless drones. This process is completely reversible, making their race extremely versatile.

At the same time, said rulers possess technology to among other things control weather (at least on a local scale) and piece together human corpses into living monstrous doglike creatures.
</li><li> A scenario like this is used in-character in <em>Martians in Maggody</em>, when a reporter convinces two guilible locals that stealing copies of a UFO enthusiast's computer files is the only way to prevent scary aliens from enslaving humanity and forcing everyone to work in mines.

He's an IRS agent investigating the UFO enthusiast's unreported profits from book sales and lecture fees.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst">Myst</a></em> tie-in novel <em>The Book of D'ni</em> introduces the Tehranee, a race of people so advanced, especially in engineering and chemistry, that they are universally indolent, wiling away their days in the pursuit of superior artistry and poesis, while the burden of building and maintaining their vast artworks is placed on a huge caste of slaves. Worse, these people's linking technology allows them to travel instantly to any planet they can describe, giving them access to basically unlimited resources of every kind, which should make all forms of slavery utterly obsolete. Thus, the Tehranee preserve slavery apparently just because it's traditional and they can't be bothered to create a better system. The culture (and the world they recruit overseers from) is utterly wiped out in the inevitable revolt.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nova">Nova</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelRDelany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelRDelany">Samuel R. Delany</a>, everyone in the future has cyborg implants that allow them to interface with machinery, letting people control any machine, from vacuum cleaners to spaceships, and pseudo-physically perform labor through them  not quite manual labor, but not using robots. While it would be possible to automate everything, it was found that people have a psychological need to connect their actions to work rather than letting robots do everything for them.

One of the characters notes that slavery is economically inefficient compared to automation, but was apparently instituted to help the ruling class keep control. It gets to the point that high-class slaves are mostly running the government, however, so when it falls to an invasion they can easily overthrow and slaughter their masters, declaring a communist state.

Use of anything other than manual labor risks exposing the glitterstim spice to light or heat and reducing its value and potency. Lampshaded heavily in the book that introduces this explanation. There are species in the galaxy that consider the cold, dark mines an ideal environment <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and after leading a revolt, Luke decides to keep the mines operating, using paid labor from such races.

<ul><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">Rogue Squadron</a></em> series. The various prisoners of <em>Lusankya</em> are, to their knowledge, used as slave labor in mines. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact, the mines are a deception meant to keep the prisoners from finding the actual escape routes and the manual labor is just a form of distraction and punishment.

</li><li> In the EU novel, <em>The Rise of Darth Vader</em>, this is confirmed: Kashyyyk was punished for harboring fugitive Jedi and fighting Imperial troops sent to retrieve them. However, while the Wookies and Mon Calamari <em>are</em> used for their technical skill by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, it backfires on them: Admiral Ackbar started as Tarkin's slave before escaping to the Rebels, taking valuable intelligence with him, nearly killing Tarkin, while the Wookies sabotaged everything on the Death Star they could.

Wookiee labor was used in places where it would be too expensive to use and keep repairing droids, and was a revenue stream for Czerka while they found out what else the planet could get used for.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Great Galactic War</a> era, the Empire threw almost everyone who wasn't human or Sith species (and even a few that were) into the slave pits.

The dark and cold and tight confines of the tunnels make droid mining impractical.

When one of them explains this plan to one of the humans, the human exasperatedly asks what use they could possibly have for slaves when they have the technology to move a giant chunk of a distant planet thousands of light years to their present location.

Also, they are largely unconcerned with doing things efficiently, instead preferring to do things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">impressively</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>. This is explicitly said to provide the Good Guys with one of their main advantages against the Goa'uld.
<ul><li> It should be noted that the Goa'uld quite logically did <em>not</em> want to provide advanced technology to their slaves, so while they themselves rode around in fancy starships, their servants largely lived on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges">dung age</a> planets. And it's stated a few times on the show that the Goa'uld are parasites by mentality as well as by nature. They don't innovate, they steal technology (like the eponymous gates) from other civilizations. It's possible they never came across anyone using robots to steal from them. That said, there were earlier instances of Goa'uld using some automation. One pre-Anubis episode featured a Goa'uld robotic probe that was seen exploring a planet on its own, and Teal'c believed this was a brand-new development — the task might have previously been assigned to bands of Jaffa warriors.
</li><li> However, remember the Goa'uld were not interested in power for some pragmatic purpose, but in power <em>itself</em>. They saw themselves as <em>gods</em>, after all, and competed through showmanship and intimidation as much as through things like production and military efficiency. An inefficient army of terrified slaves might impress a Goa'uld's rivals far more than an efficient machine doing the same job in half the time. The show frequently acknowledged this as the Goa'uld's key weakness.
</li><li> Whatever their attitudes, even the Goa'uld's basic <em>biology</em> gives them an excellent reason to Use Manual Labor In The Future: they're obligate parasites of humanoids. Robots can't be parasitized, but slaves can. And humans, to the Goa'uld, are really just vehicles they don't happen to be riding around in at the moment, so why <em>not</em> put them to work in the meantime?
</li><li> The Ori continued the trend. Even with all the knowledge of ascended beings, their ships are still built by their primitive human worshipers. This one is also justified, as the Ori quite literally gain power from worship, so their entire powerbase rests on their followers being too stupid to realize they're being conned.

Chaos forces and Dark Eldar use slaves because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">it's more fun that way</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> is common in <em>40K</em>; it's the only place where your starship is powered by plasma reactors but you need thousands of press-ganged shanghaied deckhands to load its guns. With ropes. While being whipped. Most of the manufacturing is done by 'servitors', which are lobotomised cyborgs used for manual labour (although they are often equipped with heavy weaponry in combat situations), made up of heretics, criminals, etc. (though most are actually just human blanks grown in vats; servitors use human brains as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU">Wetware CPU</a>, due to AI ban), then completely mind wiped, drugged and many of the organs/limbs replaced with more 'efficient' robotic equivalents. In 40k, cybernetics is ubiquitous and easier to control (as in, one of the least grimdarked-to-hell elements in the setting) than the aforementioned Iron Men. The Forge Worlds (run entirely by the Adeptus Mechanicus) are responsible for producing the monumental amounts of equipment needed daily by the Imperium of Man, have a relatively small human population, for example Mars (The first human colony and the headquarters of the Adeptus Mechanicus) has a population of 20 billion, while the Hive World Ichar IV (before it was consumed by the Tyranids) had 500 billion and produced far less (particularly when the Genestealers showed up).
</li><li> It doesn't help that said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineCult">Adeptus Mechanicus</a> acts like an autonomous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> that monopolizes any advanced technology, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> to simple automated systems, in the Imperium. Any independent scientist or research organization that gets too popular will be forcibly bought, assimilated or killed by the Adeptus Mechanicus, who think that advanced archaeotech obtained from Precursors are better than independent innovation. They entirely have the capability to build an army of automated servitors to do the fighting for the Imperium, only that they think they're the only ones in the entire universe who have any idea about something arcane and forgotten called "Science", and hence hate to share it openly with other factions of the Imperium, who in turn don't fully trust the Mechanicus and consider them as borderline heretics who get away with it because the Mechanicus answers only to the Emperor himself, and are responsible for personally maintaining the Emperor's life-support system. This forces said other factions to instead rely on manual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> which are far cheaper than hiring servitors and a Techpriest who will maintain the automated systems.
</li><li> Ultimately, all of this is reflective a curious (and abhorrent) form of dealing with scarcity. Due to the constant war, constant strain on resources, overpopulation, and loss of technology, the Imperium has quickly found that the one resource it <em>does</em> have for free are human bodies that keep breeding more and more like a bunch of tyranids. Thus, while it may be more efficient in the instant case (i.e. an individual starship) to build an autoloader for your skyscraper shells, on the galactic scale, the materials needed to build such a loader are far, far more desperately needed to maintain the already-existing archaeotech, and/or build lasguns and M2 Browning heavy machine guns (yes, the 100 year old design is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">still in use, more or less unchanged, 38,000 years in the future</a>). There are practical benefits as well. An autoloader that is damaged in combat will probably not be brought back online soon enough to continue the fight, but if a work gang is killed off the rubble can be cleared and the workers replaced in a matter of minutes.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda">Necromunda</a></em>, a hive world with its' own spin-off game based on gang wars, the one resource that the planet has in abundance is manpower. As a result, the massive population of the Necromundan hives spend the majority of their lives labouring away in the manufactories to produce the planets manufactured goods. This is taken even further in the underhive where the lack of resources means the population have to partake in backbreaking labour just to survive, something that has resulted in a thriving slave trade. In the first couple of editions of the game, the Pit Slaves were a gang made up of escaped slaves who had been fitted with crude cybernetics to make them more efficient at their roll.

This makes sense in many applications since robots are expensive to produce but human vermin are cheap and disposable. Notable cases include:
<ul><li> Zone New Delhi and Zone Denver, which use human brain tissue or even whole brains as a substitute for expensive electronics to run lesser robots.
</li><li> Zone Moscow, which uses human agents to collect what remains of the libraries and artwork of human civilization.
</li><li> Zone <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Washington, where the human inhabitants believe themselves to be the sole remaining human-controlled nation and labour mightily to maintain the strength of their military robots to keep it that way - controlled, of course, by their 'tame' AI that in actuality runs the government.</span>
</li><li> Some of the Zoneminds that have instead chosen to ruthlessly eradicate all humans immediately are actually at an economic disadvantage to their bretheren because of it, both due to the lack of cheap labor and the extra resources they've expended in the extermination efforts.

It is illegal in the Imperium, though the Sword Worlds have a judicial slavery as punishment for murder, treason, and other heinous crimes (which makes one amused at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a> of the fate of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Space Pirate</a> caught while trying to sell off his captives). It is not always made clear what the slaves are expected to do. However the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> of <em>Traveller</em> at least sort of justifies it.
</li><li> This is almost to be expected in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em>, given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> of the setting. Throughout much of North America, people are often enslaved or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndenturedServitude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndenturedServitude">indentured</a>, turned into cyborgs and used as miners. The Coalition doesn't use slave-borgs, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">nonhumans</a> are sometimes enslaved and employed in the mega-cities or the 'burbs. In magic-dominated places, meanwhile, slavery is widespread and slaves are used for any and every task, be it labor, warfare, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames">Gladiator Games</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">sex</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan">food</a> (the latter is a big one, since a <em>lot</em> of alien evils do it to cement their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> status).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns">Fading Suns</a></em> due to the Church's attitude towards technology there is a great deal of demand for manual labor. The Muster Guild specializes in providing workers though most of them are temps or outright slaves while members get cushy supervisor positions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em> identured servitude was revived as a means for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega Corps</a> and their Hypercorp successors to obtain cheap labor for their off-world colonies, it was accepted due to the expense of interplanetary travel, especially since the fastest means is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">upload your ego</a> into a new body at your destination. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">The Fall</a> there were suddenly billions of disembodied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost">infugees</a> willing to sign anything if it meant eventually having flesh again. The practice is condemned by most Autonomists, excepting the anarcho-capitalist Extropians who also practice debt slavery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> has ridiculously advanced robotics, but people who have worked their way up to the highest security clearances replace robot servants with human because robot servants are just so low-grade.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, human labor is far cheaper than machine labor, particularly in the Periphery where civilization never truly recovered from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">300 years of total warfare</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">destroyed humanity's technology base</a>. The tiny Marian Hegemony that styles itself after Ancient Rome is the only nation that condones slavery. The Clans, meanwhile, have a Caste system where they have Technicians (responsible for keeping all military equipment like Battlemechs and warships functional) and at the bottom, Laborors, who take care of every menial function like growing food or performing factory work. Laborors have effectively no rights in Clan society, they're regularly forced to meet high quotas (regardless of how realistic said quotas are), they get minimal food or medical supplies allocated to them, and they often lack any leasure time or forms of entertainment.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTime">Real Time</a> board game <a class="urllink" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert">Space Alert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, players can perform exactly two actions, they can move or press buttons. Nothing on the ship works without a member of the crew pressing a button, which in turn can only be located in the same compartment as the device said button controls (hence the whole movement mechanic).
<ul><li> The game doubles down on the need for manual labour by requiring that players regularly jiggle the mouse attached to the main computer least the screen saver activate and shut the ship down for a turn!
</li><li> The ship also comes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Battle Droids</a> that can accompany players to repel boarders, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">can't be ordered to press the freaking buttons</a>.

The "transhuman" arm of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilArmy">Combine Overwatch</a> also appears to be a lesser version of this; the changes made are less radical and they retain more intelligence, however the process is voluntary.

It then turns out that robots <em>do</em> perform most of the real mining labor, and the human-heavy mining operation is really just a front for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">Evilutionary Biologist</a> to get test subjects for his (honestly pretty pointless-looking) secret experiments away from the prying eyes of Earth's government. Note that <em>RF</em> originated as an entry in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a></em> series, the premise of which centers around futuristic mines run entirely by robots (which have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">their own problems</a>).
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">Gaia Online</a></em> event, each of the four towns was assigned two fantasy races to assist them in the upcoming "Rejected Olympics". The futuristic town of Aekea got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Blizzard Style Orcs</a>, in addition to the previously introduced Aliens. The new aliens were created by leftover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> that the <em>real</em> aliens left behind, while the orcs were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> away by saying they were a newly discovered species that have been hired as manual laborers. One character even wonders if the orcs are actually being payed for their work. ...Of course, there's just one problem. <em>AEKEA IS A CITY FULL OF ROBOTS</em>. It's the only city that's even <em>allowed</em> to have robots, as they were banned everywhere else after some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">war that no one talks about.</a> But the fact that you are enslaving <em>orcs</em> to effectively do something that could be accomplished by a <em>tow truck</em> or a <em>pulley</em> is a bit confusing...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em> the Amarr Empire makes a wide use of slaves. Although they could easily replace most of their slaves with advanced technology, like the other nations have done, the Amarr believe that, by enslaving "lesser" peoples like the Minmatar, they are saving these people's souls. It's no surprise that the Amarr are quite far behind technologically when compared to the Gallente and especially the Caldari.
</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader">Crusader</a></em> game, <em>No Regret</em>, makes a few things clear. First, the most valuable mineral in the solar system is found almost exlusively on the moon—almost half of known reserves are there. Second, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">WEC</a> ships mostly political prisoners there, to get them out of the way and do mining with minimal safety while surrounded by heavily-armed guards. Third, the game's own lore states that while semi-sentient guard robots and maintenance bots are present, they are apparently quite expensive, compared to unprotected laborers operating nonsentient machinery with guns pointed at their heads. Played straight, justifed, and subvereted all at once.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> when you eventually learn the slaves in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> human ranches aren't there for any real work.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> The franchise is notable for almost entirely averting this trope: almost every single person you see with a job is either a highly skilled technical worker/manager (e.g. engineers, scientists, programmers, financial analysts, stockbrokers, financial managers, doctors, lawyers), or in a service position where a personal touch is the entire point (e.g. waiters, beauticians, personal care assistants, chefs, guards, teachers, counselors, social workers, salesmen). The manual labor is done by fleets of robots, drones, and hyper-efficient nanofabricators. At a few points, such as in his conversations with the "administrative assistant" Kelly or an unnamed asari shopkeeper on the Citadel, Shepard can outright ask why they still have jobs when a simple virtual intelligence or robot can accomplish it nearly as well for cheaper. The answer? Their <em>real</em> jobs are talking to people to make them feel comfortable and adding a personal touch to the product or service, because people will pay more for it even if it technically changes little, thus adding value (a real life economic phenomenon known as mass customization). This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">shown</a> in the conversations with Khalisah al-Jilani: the job of "cameraman" is now occupied by a flying semi-autonomous camera robot, but there's still a reporter in front of the camera because people prefer it that way. The very few species that <em>do</em> still use organics for manual labor are specifically noted to be odd for it:
</li><li> The batarians still practice slavery, despite a being starfaring civilization for centuries. They argue that slavery is a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureJustifiesEverything">cultural right</a>" of their people; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Council</a> doesn't buy it. It's made clear multiple times that this (along with other policies like autarky) has made them an economic basketcase.
</li><li> The kett of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> do this with some of their captives, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if they decided they're not "worthy" of Exaltation</span>, working them to death in camps. This in addition to actual mechanical labor they use elsewhere. On the plus side, it gives the workers a chance of escaping or getting rescued. In the ketts' case, the reason is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">religious</a>: they exalt organic forms above machinery, to the point that even their warships are biomimetic.

<ul><li> The Pit of Saron instance takes place in/around a large open-pit mine being worked on by undead miners and slaves captured from the Alliance and Horde armies. Fair enough. But when the players lead the Inevitable Slave Revolt against the overseer, you might wonder - why would the Scourge bother with living slaves when they could just kill them, raise them from the dead, and have undead slaves? Undead don't need to eat, after all, and mindless skeletons won't be plotting revenge any time soon.
</li><li> The Silvermoon City tailor shop has a basement that is filled with leper gnomes working looms to manufacture textiles. They sleep on thin rugs on the floor, cry at times, and are watched over the store owner's succubus minion.

It also gives the other two nations even more reasons to fight Yuri, and freeing the slaves is actually possible.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elite">Elite</a></em> you could trade in slaves, though it would mean your legal status would take a hit. You could even <em>accidentally</em> pick up slaves if you scooped up an escape pod from an enemy ship (and there was no way to free them, or hand them over to the cops). <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSourceRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSourceRemake">Open Source Remake</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oolite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oolite">Oolite</a></em> fixed this by offering a small reward paid out from the survivor's insurance policy instead, and occasionally a bounty from the local police if they turn out to be a wanted felon, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">you can still do it anyway if you feel like being a dick.</a>
</li><li> In the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EliteDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EliteDangerous">Elite: Dangerous</a></em>, the democratic/corporate Federation is heavily automated, while the patronage/oligarchy Empire makes heavy use of 'Imperial slaves' for manual labor. Imperial slavery is essentially a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndenturedServitude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndenturedServitude">Indentured Servitude</a> where people under debt sell themselves for a set period to a buyer, who manages their expenses, health, and gives them an agreed-upon workload; this is generally considered to be a spartan, but livable arrangement. However, at the borders of Imperial space the slaves may be traded to shady Commanders who fly off to Federal and Independent space to sell them on the totally unregulated black market, and there are several instances of the Empire invading systems and taking the citizens as Imperial Slaves.

They claim that slavery is an inherent part of their culture, and their society would collapse without it. Then again, they also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">brutal torture of said slaves as entertainment</a>. Their science buildings also work by sucking the brainpower (and even thoughts and dreams) out of slaves' minds.

Thaks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Dread Lords</a>' influence, the Korath decide to wipe out any non-Drengin from the galaxy (they actually succeed in wiping out two races). However, since the Drengin economy hinges on slaves, they can't have the Korath be doing that.
</li><li> The backstory to the first game even shows the lengths the Drengin will go to in order to get slaves. Millennia before the Arceans made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContact">First Contact</a> with humans, the Drengin were sending out sublight probes to other stars to map them out. They discovered the Torians and decide to conquer them. Since, until the humans invented the hyperdrive, all races had to use static <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">hypergates</a>, they spent 75,000 years dragging a hypergate from Drengi to Toria and an additional 5 years for the conquest fleet to arrive after activating the gate. Now that's commitment! Of course, it also made it easy for the Torians to overthrow them. They simply shut down the gate after fighting off the planetary garrison, preventing any reinforcements from being sent. It's heavily implied that this would have been the fate of the humans had they chosen to activate their gate when the Arceans sent them the blueprints.

The social prestige seems to be the main reason for this as they end up posing as gods, but an even BIGGER reason is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when purely enslaved by the apple and ordered to concentrate, a group of humans can become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>.

</li><li> Prevalent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Piratez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Piratez">Piratez</a></em>, because hiring Runts is way easier than buying complex machinery and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies">Ubers</a> make excellent Runts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> Authoritarian and/or Xenophobic empires can legalize slavery, and depending on how the empire sets itself up, slaves might be <em>more</em> effective and efficient than actual robotic workers. (Though for anti-AI Spiritualists, it's a moot point.) There's also a variation in Force Labor purge, in which the slaves are deliberately worked to death; here, mass-scale death is the goal, the work they do before dying is just a side benefit.

Bender gets himself named Pharaoh and takes it up to eleven.
<ul><li> In another episode, Hermes and LaBarbara Conrad unwittingly vacation at a forced-labor "spa". However, the episode also subverts the trope: Hermes is freed after he uses his organizational skills to rearrange things so that all the labor can be done by "a single Australian man," making all the other slaves redundant.
</li><li> Possibly justified in the <em>Futurama</em> universe since almost all technology has highly advanced AI <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">for some reason</a>, and therefore can't/shouldn't replace slaves. Even the seemingly inanimate appliances like the television and ceiling fan expressed sentience during the robot uprising episode. Even a singing card has intelligence.
</li><li> Inverted in more ways than one when the gang go to a museum about life in the Twentieth Century. They describe the "automacar" as being constructed in factories manned by "primitive robots". By which they mean robots dressed like cavemen who say "Ooga-booga" as they hit cars with clubs. Apparently we used manual labor in the <em>past</em> but our manual labor was robot labor that was still manual labor because it was sentient.

There are TV shows, books and even art projects all about doing things the "old fashioned way" or "as they did back in ___".

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cosplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cosplay">Cosplay</a> is a good example, most cosplayers will make their own costumes. Ditto Goth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita">Gothic Lolita</a> and other "do it yourself" fashions promoting hard work and original looks. They will mock those whose hardest work is swiping the credit card. Some cosplay/costuming competitions are limited to those who did the work themselves (or, in the case of child fans, got Mom or Dad to do the work) and ban purchased costumes.
</li><li> In general, making clothing will be hard to fully automate until our robots can manipulate a needle human-style and visually perceive fabric in three-dimensional space - there are basic tasks even a human-operated sewing machine isn't really good enough for. In some ways costume making emulates the production of "high fashion" (the designs which eventually get modified for machine sewing and trickle down to department store exclusive collections and the like) and given the manpower and budgets behind those outfits, learning to sew actually <em>is</em> the economical option, even if your goals are more realistic.
</li><li> Cooking is another. Cooking is a complex art and science that actually requires a lot of skill, and making an automat for every single recipe will be costly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> promised us a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons">Jetsons' kitchen</a> complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPills">Food Pills</a>— but many of the "labor-saving devices" never really caught on, except the blender and food processor. What's more, better understanding of nutrition and human physiognomy makes food pills impractical (some basic nutrients will always require a larger-than-pill mass, and human gastric stretch receptors, which help indicate fullness, wouldn't be triggered by itty-bitty pills).
</li></ul></li><li> The manufacture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">aircraft</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">ships</a> or any large structure with tight spaces has to be done by hand. Robots can't fit into tight spaces and then make sense of bundles of wires and cables. Welding, riveting and painting in tight spaces or on irregular surfaces is still beyond the grasp of current robotics. But robots are getting better every year.
</li><li> Taking advantage of their food being very heavily standardized, McDonald's once experimented with a robotic kitchen, going so far as to build a Hong Kong outlet that used one. They scrapped the idea, but not the outlet, when the construction and maintenance turned out to be far more costly than employees. Their one fully automated outlet is still there, as a minor tourist attraction, but building more isn't worthwhile with today's technology. Likewise, "vending machine" restaurants are seldom seen today even as curiosities, because of the complexity of food preparation. Thus it's cheaper to train maneuverable high school kids than to maintain the equipment. Same thing goes for having a small, well-trained staff that makes complex food. These people will usually be harder to replace, or wield more clout during employer-employee conflicts. It's just more convenient with fairly untrained, unorganized kids, most of whom do not expect to work there more than a few years, if that.

Devices are graded from 1 to 10. So that cool gadget made in a factory by robots can be repaired by hand at home.
</li><li> An interesting historical case: Ancient Greece. Towards the later parts of its history, this society seemed to be teetering on the brink of an industrial revolution, but never quite made the plunge, instead sticking with slavery and other traditional, labor-intensive methods of production. Ancient Greece had a great deal of scientific thinkers, the capacity to build complex mechanical devices, and even developed a simple steam engine. The steam engine especially, if developed further and perfected, could have been used to simplify a lot of labor-intensive jobs, as it was when the Industrial Revolution finally did roll around. But the Ancient Greeks saw it as nothing more than a curious toy.
<ul><li> Those that did think the steam engine was great tended to not be taken seriously. One guy was pretty sure that Hero's Engine could be used to predict the weather. Given that the boiling point of water varies depending on air pressure, and that quite a bit of the weather is dependent on moving high/low pressure fronts, he was probably actually on to something. Ancient Greece also had several factors working against it that are considered a requirement for industrialization. First, their technology base was actually very low, to the point that they had little access to high grade iron for a good steel industry. Second, they had no real centralized polity to ram the reforms down their throats. Third, they would not have been able to afford it even if they did have a fully centralized authority. They actually saw the potential, but wrote it off as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>. Even the Romans, who could have possibly done it to a limited degree, would not have been able to fully pull it off for the first and third reasons respectively. The nations of Europe in the late 18th century which kicked the industrial revolution off actually had more concentrated wealth <em>individually</em> than the entire Roman Empire at it's height.
</li><li> Consider also the medieval Chinese, who invented so many amazing feats of chemistry, engineering and metallurgy yet somehow were eclipsed by the western European nations and remained a bit of an industrial backwater for hundreds of years. Though much of this was cultural, as Confucianism taught rigorous adherence to the status quo. The Chinese were never able to separate philosophy from religion and they were never able to invent the scientific <em>method</em>. They did have all the ingredients for the scientific and technological revolution, but they never made the final breakthrough. Once that was introduced from outside, however, China has rapidly risen to the spearhead of technology.
</li><li> Jared Diamond, an anthropologist, argues in his book <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em> that many factors contribute to why Europe developed industry ahead of other places, including ones like China that actually had many more native inventions. First, there's the resources on hand as mentioned above-can't industrialize if you don't have the right metals easily available. Second, politics-if you have a number of separate states, an inventor has more options when attempting to sell his idea. China once had the best sea ships in the world, but the Emperor decided they were unneeded since they already had everything, and discontinued them. By contrast, European states were almost constantly fighting and competing over resources. Thus someone like Columbus could still get backing from Spain when he was rejected first by his native Genoa and then Portugal. Similarly, Da Vinci worked for the Duke of Milan, and then the French, who had <em>conquered</em> Milan. China was a unified empire with everything centrally controlled, and their government distrusted the potentially disruptive changes inventions could bring, so most languished.
</li><li> The Chinese in the Southern Song dynasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">which lasted between 1127 to 1279</a> hold the distinction as coming the <em>closest of any pre-industrial society to starting a full-fledged industrial revolution.</em> During this era, the Southern Song saw the rise of steel &amp; iron making, coal refining (and burning), mass produced goods, drilling for oil, joint-stock companies, widespread laissez-faire proto-capitalist entrepreneuralism, paper money, and even an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">early printing press 600 years before the Gutenberg movable type.</a> Mechanical machinery was toyed with constantly, and some philosophers dwelled on the possibility of machinery replacing need for artisans and well-off peasants, the closest thing the Chinese had to a middle class. If the Southern Song lasted for even 50 more years, they could have started an industrial revolution. However, a combination of a lack of a middle class (society was still highly stratified between peasants and the elite) as well as the Mongol invasion &amp; subjugation prematurely ended the Chinese's proto-industrialization and caused them to permanently slip behind Europe and the Near East until the 1900s. Thus, to the Chinese of the Song Dynasty, this trope essentially came true.

Additionally, the loader is an extra pair of hands that can assist with maintenance, sentry duties, etc., not to mention the critical-to-morale functions of brewing tea, making soup, and so on. And having an autoloader doesn't mean no loading is done: the crew not only have to load the shells (and, in case of most Soviet designs discussed here, the separate propellant charges as well) into the autoloader first, but the autoloader only houses a portion (22-28) out of 40-50 shells carried in the tank. The rest is housed in conventional lockers, which are crammed into hard-to-reach spots throughout the hull, and have to be manually loaded by the commander or the gunner (which is awkward even in theory). The biggest problem NATO designers have however is that autoloaders interfere with their measures to reduce the risks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">magazine detonation</a>. Modern-generation MBTs, most prominently the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks">M1 Abrams</a>, place the majority of main gun shells into the extended back of the turret (the bustle), equipped with blow-out panels and sealed behind armoured doors in order to prevent the explosion of shells from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">instakilling</a> the crew. Soviet autoloaders on the other hand are located under the turret, or, on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">T-64 and T-80</a>, in a circle under the turret ring, making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">near-impossible</a> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">not</a></strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">to hit</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredCoffins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredCoffins">leaving the crew no chance of survival</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedsWithRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedsWithRockets">Soviet school of design</a> was informed heavily by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">WWII</a> experience: although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons">German Überpanzer like the Panther and the Tiger</a> could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">snipe Soviet tanks at extreme ranges</a>, they were notoriously unreliable and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy">few in number</a>, owing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">their bloated size and mass</a> - the "medium" Panther was larger (and heavier) than the Soviet IS-2 heavy tank - and so the bulk of Heer armour was made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMobile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMobile">Panzer IV</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksButNoTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksButNoTanks">StuG III</a>, which could be effective but certainly weren't as hardy.

Not that it had that many — a Soviet tank of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> was armed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">bigger gun</a> and equally thick armour compared to a NATO design of the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels">generation</a>, while being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">lighter</a> (modern Western MBTs are approaching 70 t; ComBlock designs are no heavier than 45 t) and hence more agile and economically and logistically affordable. The sole reason for this was because, as it became apparent in WWII, the Soviets ruthlessly cut down on interior volume — while Western tanks are cramped, they seem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessarilyLargeInterior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessarilyLargeInterior">ludicrously roomy</a> in comparison with Soviet-school vehicles that are near <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownCar">Clown Car</a> levels, which means that the crew, naturally, sit on top of ammo and fuel, and have by regulation to be shorter than 185 cm (which means that someone around 170 cm is actually comfortable). An autoloader does not worsen the safety situation, but helps shrink mass and size further by eliminating another member of the crew, and it was the Soviet mantra that the best protection is not being hit at all; also, the human loader would eventually get tired, and was a lot less effective in the more confined interior, as the pre-autoloader but equally small T-55 and T-62 show. Furthermore, Soviet tanks were expected to actively maneuver rather than snipe targets from hull-down positions (as NATO tanks were likely to be doing), and had poorer suspension; it is considerably harder to load the gun manually when the vertical stabilizer keeps thrusting the breech up and down. Additionally, the later-pattern autoloader on the T-72 is significantly less vulnerable: the shells are arranged not in a cylinder under the turret ring, but in a circle of the floor, and hidden at the very bottom of the vehicle behind an extra layer of armor - hence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill">anything capable of triggering a magazine detonation likely destroys the tank anyway</a>. As to the spare shell lockers, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets">new T-90 variants</a> do move them into a bustle storage compartment - and Hatedom run afoul of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">bustle haters</a>, who believe that any large turret bustle is extremely likely to get hit in combat, whereas the baseline T-90 has a compact (short and broad) turret, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">it is impossible to hit anything but the heavily-protected front from a sector of 60°</a>. Also, many Abrams loaders jam the doors open, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">completely nullifying the protective qualities of the system</a> - to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">keep the rate of fire up</a>. Finally, autoloaders are believed to be more usable in future tanks for two aspects: firstly, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Race</a> is liable to continue, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">tank guns</a> will likely get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even bigger</a>: as of 1990, there were prototypes of prototypes a Leopard 2 variant with a 140 mm cannon and a T-80 variant with a 152 mm gun. Both of these exceeded the practical abilities of human loaders and were fitted with autoloaders — much like modern 152-155 mm artillery, which uses at least partially mechanized loading instead of <em>two</em> loaders per gun. The second element of prospective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets">Russian</a> tanks is removing the crew from the turret altogether, settling the issue completely by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">a front-mounted capsule tough enough to survive the destruction of the rest of the vehicle</a> — while even further reducing the size of the turret.
</li><li> And then there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GaulsWithGrenades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GaulsWithGrenades">the French</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> out of their love for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> tanks: the Leclerc stores its ammo in the bustle, AND mounts an autoloader inside of it, and, as a bonus, it's even faster-firing than the Soviet equivalents.
</li><li> For a relatively even-handed overview, Chieftain of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a> fame discusses the pros and cons of autoloader systems <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0x-8NheU1E">in this video.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Large Chinese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which produces <em>a lot</em> of various gadgets for big name brands, including all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Apple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Apple">Apple</a> products, traditionally employs manual labour on its assembly plants, specifically because putting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">a lot of former Chinese peasants,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">orphans and abandoned little girls</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmarishFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmarishFactory">into a sweatshop and running them till they drop</a> is <em>much, much</em> cheaper than investing into a First World Japanese-style automated assembly line. This also means that Chinese "Gross Domestic Product = economic development" is actually a misunderstanding: GDP is only the average value of the products that go out of the country (e.g. Apple products and cheap toys), while real economic development is more accurately measured through Per Capita Income (as in, the actual profits for the average prole), and guess what, said Chinese peasants and little girls have almost the same minimum wage PCI as third world countries, while the GDP profits goes to executives at Foxconn and then Apple. <br/><br/>As time passed on, though, overall Chinese economic growth meant that fewer and fewer people are willing to tolerate harsh working conditions and meager pay, so the labor unrest became a problem for the company. Add to that the calls for product boycotting from the labor action groups and displeasure from the brands themselves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">who are conscious about their image</a>  and cue the news that Foxconn is investing astronomical sums into the automated assembly. Robots may be more expensive in the long run, but they don't make a fuss and don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">beat the managers half to death</a>.
</li><li> Sailing. No matter the size of the boat, anything from hauling the sails to changing the tack is done manually. That's because yachts are usually cramped boats with little space for extra machinery, and because technology has a tendency to fail when least expected. Besides that, crew members are easily movable ballast where extra weight is needed. Back when steam had only started to make inroads, <em>huge</em> crews that sailing ships had were their second main disadvantage after their reliance on the weather. Steamboats might've needed a place for coal and thus carry less cargo, but they could be manned by twenty sailors instead of more than hundred like a sailboat of same size. So the mechanical winches were installed, sail plans simplified, emergency engines mounted, and last cargo-carrying sail ships actually had remarkably small crews, not much larger than steamships, with sailors almost never going aloft. But <em>then</em> is was discovered that sailing makes an excellent practice even for steamship sailors. And so the <em>tall ships</em> were born  a mobile classes of various marine schools, which are <em>intentionally</em> built in the old-fashioned way to teach the cadets what the sea really <em>is</em>. There are several unconventional and very high performance designs that use sail-by-wire or computer controlled sail trimming... the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELL5lTE9Tek">Walker Wingsail<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> design is nearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">20 years old</a> and the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sailrocket.com/node/286">Vestas Sailrocket<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a later design capable of 65 knots under sail power. There's still no substitute for something that can be repaired and driven by hand though, given that you don't want your motors to seize up or your electronics when you're several days or weeks sail away from land...
