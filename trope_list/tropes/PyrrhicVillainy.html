Actually... no. Sometimes the villain surprises us all and is victorious, even if only in the short-term. However, victory comes with a price. Both they and the audience may well ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItReallyWorthIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasItReallyWorthIt">if it was</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">worth it</a>. Often this takes one of two forms: either it has taken so much effort (and such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">underhanded methods</a>) to win that it has left the good guys as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">moral victors</a> with a better legacy, or in order to accomplish their goal the villain has had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">to sacrifice what they cared for most</a> and/or made them likable and/or relatable-to for the audience.
</p><p>So while their efforts might have paid off, to answer the earlier question of whether it was worth it: frequently it is not.

This sort of plot may be found in a villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, back when the villain was either a hero or a much lesser villain, and first turned to true villainy, bringing victory... but at a cost.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory">Meaningless Villain Victory</a> is when the villain wins but a sudden unforeseen event renders their victory hollow and their efforts for naught. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks">Being Evil Sucks</a> also counts if the villain in question has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> about the choices he made.

<ul><li> Harry McDowell in the anime version of the game franchise <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gungrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gungrave">Gungrave</a></em> first just wanted enough power to live his life freely and protect the people important to him. With time, he succeeds in rising to the top of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">Millennion</a> and making it more powerful than the law itself, but only by losing sight of his original goals and betraying almost everyone he cares about. He's driven to kill both Brandon, his best friend whom he relied on all his life (leading to some spectacular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdowns</a>), the fatherly prior head of the organization and his wife, Brandon's sweetheart. Twenty years later, though, he's finally able to face Brandon and come to terms with his life.
<ul><li> Conversely, in the game's continuity, he shows no remorse for killing Brandon/Grave (Harry in the game's storyline is depicted as little more than a complete prick). Either way, he still wanted Mika, the innocent daughter of Grave's former love interest dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry even had Big Daddy used as a guinea pig and mutated him into an acid flame-spewing monstrosity, just to <em>see what kind of effects Necro-Rise/S.E.E.D. would have on him</em> and has no qualms about siccing Big Daddy on Grave as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of the game. As a result, Harry dies, Grave lives, and moves on with his "life" with Mika.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em>. Yes, your contract with Enma Ai gives you what you want: to punish someone who's slighted you big time. However, by sending that person to Hell, you've condemned <em>yourself</em> as well, since when your life comes to an end, you will join them in Hell. See the mark on your chest? It'll remind you of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> you made.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">The Major</a> succeeds in defeating Alucard, even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Integra</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">kills</a> him in the end. Also, London ultimately rebuilds and life continues on like normal. And just like the last time he was soundly beaten, Alucard is never truly out of the game; he comes back <em>eventually</em>.</span>
<ul><li> On the other hand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Major was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a>, and everything he did was with this singular goal in mind, so he may have gotten exactly what he wanted.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Happens twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kars, the main villain of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">Part 2</a>, gets what he wants <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is to become the ultimate lifeform, which lives forever and can adapt to any environment or situation</span>, but ends up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">flung into space, where he will live forever, but slowly go insane from the boredom</span>.
</li><li> Enrico Pucci in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">Part 6</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills most of the heroes and obtains his vision of "heaven", if only for a moment... but then gets killed by a mere child, and the world then gets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>; and he's no longer in the universe, having never been born</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Although it may depend somewhat on your interpretation, SEELE's plan doesn't seem to have turned out the way they intended by the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>.
<ul><li> Chairman Keel seemed quite pleased with the outcome. Presumably, they are among the people who can't "imagine themselves in their own hearts", so no free resurrection card for them, but that's apparently what they wanted.
<ul><li> Shinji, arguably, fits this trope better. In both endings, this is what he wanted. In both endings, he got better, but after getting what he wanted... well, Alexander the Great might have wept over no more worlds to conquer, but thanks to Shinji there's no longer a world.
</li></ul></li><li> Gendo certainly didn't get what he wanted. Rei rejected him in favor of Shinji, and it's implied that he is not reunited with Yui in the pseudo-afterlife that is Third Impact, since (what appears to be) Yui/Unit 01's response is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">literally biting his head off.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/SaintBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/SaintBeast">Saint Beast</a></em>, having defeated two justified rebellions from the angels, Zeus is sick of war and decides to retire and go into a long sleep.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em> Season 2, Kirito Kamui finally killed Masako Togane and forced the Sibyl System to judge itself. However, everything he did is already pointless because the system remains standing and is on the verge of expanding its control outside Japan by lending its "help" to SEAUn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and assassinating its leader when he realized their true nature</span>. All that Kamui did was helping Sibyl get rid of those defective brains that hinder their progress and the ones left are the sociopathic ones.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Zamasu has actually succeeded in his "Zero Mortal Plan" when his bodiless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> form has successfully managed to wipe out all mortal life in Future Trunks Timeline. Unfortunately, by that time, he has completely lost his sanity meaning that he will never be able to enjoy this victory. Furthermore, he also failed to kill the fighters who cause him the most grief and shortly afterwards, gets immediately wiped out by Zen'O after Goku called him. Zamasu's plan ultimately amounted to nothing because of this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilmanCrybaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilmanCrybaby">DEVILMAN crybaby</a></em> has Ryo Asuka a.k.a. Satan wins his battle with Akira and succeed in killing off all of the Devilmen and humanity. However, all the demons are dead as well, and Ryo realizes too late that his victory means nothing since what he <em>truly</em> wanted was to be with the only person ever he cared for, except that he killed said person. Ryo consequently falls into despair and grief just as God obliterates the Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RosePrincessHellrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RosePrincessHellrage">Rose Princess Hellrage</a></em> starts the story with the title character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> successfully mounting a coup against her father to seize the crown. Congratulations. Unfortunately for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead">Evil Redhead</a>, the way he did it only served to make his rule a mine field.

On top of that, his supporters are fanatics he exploited with their hatred of the main character's silver hair and eyes, so they go and initiate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>, having her rise up as the very agent to destroy his country, and the way they did it completely alienated The Church, the one organization best suited to deal with her.

<ul><li> In <em>Kankinkon</em>, the most powerful man in the setting, the Saijou family patriarch Touji, has accomplished this. He used his connections, riches, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainwithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainwithGoodPublicity">good public face</a> to kidnap the woman he fell in love with, force her into marriage, and then fool her family into thinking she was taken care of after hitting her head and giving him their blessing. He even received a son and heir out of the ordeal and gets to have wild sex with her whenever he wants, but none of it even matters since he grew to only desire her love. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">And he will never get it</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">because he trapped her into the marriage in the first place.</a>

By and large, he's a fairly benevolent monarch and does much to solve many of the world's problems. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring">he's so bored out of his mind</a> that when the one unaffected hero manages to break the spell on a few others, he lets the rebellion win.

</li><li> This is a running theme with Dr. Doom; every time he manages to take control of a nation/planet, he'll spruce the place up very nicely and run it better than most governments ever manage, but will ultimately get bored of running it. Doom enjoys the challenge of taking over a nation and solving problems, not the mundane managerial work of keeping national status quo. The exception is in <em>Doom 2099.</em> He conquers the United States, and actually intends to keep power, so he can fix the <em>entire world.</em> It doesn't end well for him, the country, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">most of the heroes.</a>

She commits a number of heinous crimes, including cutting off Rainbow Dash's wings and burning Rarity's boutique, to make sure they have no choice but to follow her philosophy of twisted equality. She eventually obtains even the Princesses' cutie marks and rules over Equestria. It quickly collapses under her rule—ponies starve due to farmers' inability to grow crops and chefs' inability to make edible food, others freeze in uncontrollable weather, houses collapse due to incompetent builders, and disease runs rampant due to lack of doctors. Eventually, everypony dies and Equestria is reduced to a completely lifeless wasteland. Realizing her mistakes, Starlight waits for her original-timeline self and Twilight to arrive so she can show herself what Equestria will look like if she turns everypony "equal".

She's smart, clever, and cunning, just not as much as she thinks she is. As a result, the long term consequences of her actions keep coming back to bite her.
<ul><li> Cersei Lannister's smirking victory over Tyrion and later the Tyrells become meaningless as it comes with a high price. Her champion Ser Gregor Clegane winning over Oberyn Martell in Tyrion's trial on Joffrey's murder breaks new tensions from Dorne and leads to Myrcella's death. Jaime, out of sympathy for Tyrion, helps him escape only for Tyrion to kill Tywin on the way out, leaving the kingdom in her less-than-capable hands. Her reinstatement of the Faith Militant as a means to get back at the Tyrells backfires when she herself gets arrested and punished for her own crimes which also leads her own son Tommen to accept the Faith as part of their alliance to the Iron Throne.
<div class="indent"><strong>Olenna:</strong> You have no support, not anymore. Your brother is gone; the High Sparrow saw through that. The rest of your family abandoned you. The people despised you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy that I've found in this misery.
</div></li><li> At the end of Season 6, Cersei finds herself in an even worse position. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She has triumphed over her enemies by detonating a wildfire cache under the Great Sept of Baelor, killing several hundred people from the nobility (including most remaining members of Houses Tyrell and Lannister, all of whom were opposing her) and the Faith within the sept, (who were about to put her on trial) probably as many commoners outside it and destroying a good chunk of the capital city. In the aftermath, her only surviving son commits suicide because Cersei was too busy torturing a prisoner who had once abused her to comfort him. Cersei has made it onto the throne at last, but her House is bankrupt, the crown is deeply in debt and her armies are depleted by war. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Nearly the entire realm is either starting or in the middle of some form of rebellion against the throne</a>, meaning that while she is positioned in a way that no one in King's Landing can challenge her, she doesn't rule much beyond that demesne, not to mention the fact that she has added the plentiful Reach to the list of enemies of the increasingly powerless crown. On top of all this Daenerys has finally launched a full-scale invasion backed by both her armies and her dragons, and with the support of Tyrion and Lady Olenna of House Tyrell, uneasy but former allies alienated by Cersei, and the harshest winter in recorded history has just started. Despite her apparent power and triumph due to ascending to the throne, the number of people actually loyal to Cersei can be counted on one hand (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Qyburn, and the Mountain as her personal muscle), she has just as many if not more enemies than ever, and even her twin brother has become disillusioned with her, emotionally isolating her from everyone she cares about.</span>
</li><li> By the end of season 7, it's even worse for Cersei. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thanks to her alliance with the Ironborn and sacrificing her own home territory to strike at the Tyrells the war is going surprisingly well for her, but she still has no way to deal with the dragons and ultimate defeat is inevitable. When Daenerys unexpectedly calls for a ceasefire to deal with the imminent undead invasion Cersei not only agrees but declares that she will send her own armies north as well since she has no desire to rule a graveyard. Only this is a lie; as soon as the invaders head north she orders the planning to move her own troops stopped, and explains that her real plan is to play for time while she brings in mercenary reinforcements from Essos. She could have done this by simply accepting the ceasefire; she offered to join the defense for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">literally no reason other than that it gave her the pleasure of betraying them</a>. This is what finally convinces Jaime that she's completely mad and leads directly to his defection.</span>
</li><li> In the series finale, things end about as badly as they possibly could for Cersei. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cersei's naval forces take out Rhegar and kidnap then execute Missandei. Grey Worm develops an obsession with destroying everything connected to Cersei, and with her last sane-and-trusted lieutenant dead, there's nobody left to keep Daenerys' inner rage from devolving into full-blown madness. The rest of King's Landing quickly surrenders unconditionally, but that just triggers Daenerys' mental breakdown from fear of being unloved and she <em>orders her forces to systematically kill every last civilian</em>. Cersei's last moments are of pure terror as she begs the gods to save her, and is quickly crushed to death by falling castle. Meanwhile, Daenerys is quietly backstabbed by Jon before she can continue her purge across Westeros and beyond. And instead of Jon Targaryen taking the throne, Bran quickly manipulates his way into getting <em>elected</em> as the Seven Kingdoms' first proto-president King, and then quickly redistributes his powers to a council made of everyone alive who showed the most common sense. In the end, both of the women who obsessed over the throne were crushed by their need for it, the titular throne itself was melted down and replaced with a republican government, and with (implied) industrial progress finally taking place things have gotten better with no one the wiser.</span>

Simpson</em>, Simpson manages to get acquitted thanks to a combination of a fiendishly clever defense team, a string of poor decisions by the prosecutors, and one of the officers pulling a last-minute Fifth Amendment plea to avoid being cross-examined. He is technically a free man, but half of Los Angeles (including most of his white neighbors) now hates his guts, his former in-laws are challenging him for custody of his younger children, and Robert Kardashian, one of his few real friends, has realized that Simpson used him and never wants to see him again.

In doing so, Billy indirectly causes Penny's death and Captain Hammer's humiliation. The final scenes show him living the high life of an A-List villain... but the final shot shows Billy, heart-broken and traumatized. And the final song describes that he has achieved everything he ever wanted, but the lyrics are dripping with double meanings: "The world I wanted at my feet": the world is my oyster, or Penny - the "world I wanted" - lying dead at his feet. It's also shown that all of this was strictly unnecessary; Penny thought Billy was attractive, and probably would have gone out with him had he asked her to.

However, after a relatively short spell of being horrified and depressed, JO remembers that it was just fiction and all the good things about real life, then goes outside to enjoy himself and cheer himself up by playing with his roommate's dog. Meanwhile, Sage is left in a deep depression with his "victory", pondering where mankind has gone wrong, and whether a species capable of such cruelty and darkness is worthy of redemption.
