Nowadays though it has, ironically, acquired a quaint sort of datedness to it: inevitably, it will be more reminiscent of the era the work <em>came from</em>. Also sometimes called "Retro Futuristic".
</p><p>Think of mobile phones as a simple example. Once, they were large, cumbersome, and it was considered that they would only ever be available to the rich. Works from that era will tend to depict even a 'futuristic' phone as still no smaller or sleeker than a brick plugged into a suitcase. Later, when they became widely available and shrank dramatically as technology improved, for a while it was assumed they would keep getting smaller and smaller; depictions of the future from this period will show people using tiny communication devices. Again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a> and the preference has shifted to them to growing increasingly large once more yet thin enough to slide into the back pocket of your jeans. Any current depiction of the future featuring such slablike devices will also turn into a time capsule of the period it was made in, if and when flexible and foldable phones become commonplace. And so on.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes the dated feeling is due to this sort of straight-line extrapolation of trends ascendant when the work was written into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture">the (far) future</a>. Sometimes the datedness is a bit more subtle. It's possible that the prediction turned out to be technologically or aesthetically accurate (or at least on the right track), but still fails because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">the designer's implicit assumption that social values will be the same in the future as in their own time</a> — as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">demonstrated</a> in the page image.
</p><p>Often the datedness behind zeerusty designs lies in the attempt of the designers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWereTryingTooHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWereTryingTooHard">to 'improve' on the technology of their time</a>, only to find out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">more mundane designs are actually far more efficient</a> if advanced engineering and craftsmanship are used on them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Not that this is not always a bad thing</a>: often the dated vision of the future is a lot more imaginative than anything being attempted today, with more modern, 'realistic' depictions striking viewers as bland and boring precisely because of the authenticity.

The most out-of-date part is the assumption that AT&amp;T would be the main carrier for all  or <em>any</em>  of these technologies. Almost every one of those technologies exists in pretty much the form depicted in the commercial but most of them are either non-centralized or connected to the public Internet; the only way AT&amp;T would make any money off of any of them would be as a patent holder.
</li><li> Telmex (a telephone company in Mexico) heralded in 2008 its brand-new video phone service by airing a "Homage to the Video Calls", which was basically a montage of every single "TV phone" featured in a sci-fi movie.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ProjectBlueEarthSOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ProjectBlueEarthSOS">Project Blue Earth SOS</a></em> purposely invokes this, since it's a throwback to '50s science fiction TV. The series takes place in an alternate version of the 1990s and the technology and setting is made to display this trope due to it being how someone from the 50s would imagine the 90s.

</li><li> In the same anime one of the characters in a scene is listening to music on <strong>a Walkman</strong>.
</li><li> The prominence of boxy desktop computers in <em>Gundam Wing</em> (made in 1995).
</li><li> The majority of UC Gundam series have the ubiquitous appearance of floppy disks, even ones made during the age of Compact Discs and Laserdisc, like <em>Gundam 0083</em> and <em>The 08th MS Team</em>.
</li><li> According to <em>The 08th MS Team</em>, the Apsalus, a flying weapon of mass destruction, uses the same hard- and software components as a mid 1990s desktop PC, such as a 6X86MX CPU from the long-defunct manufacturer Cyrix. Along with DirectX6, you can kinda tell why the first 2 versions of the Apsalus ended up crash landed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">G Gundam</a></em> has a scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Master</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Asia</a> holds up a floppy, claiming it contains vast amounts of information.
</li><li> The theatrical recap trilogy of <em>Zeta Gundam</em>, which extensively uses footage from the 1985 TV series, adds laptops and more futuristic computer displays, in an attempt to renew the futurism.
</li></ul></li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em>, released in 1987 and set in 2032, is similar: clothes and hairstyles are <em>very</em> 1980s; car-phones are common, but the hand-held ones are rare, meaning characters make calls from phone boxes with video screens, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">the Soviet Union and East Germany still exist,</a> at least in the very first OVA. However it is worth noting that even though they completely missed the Internet revolution, many of the mecha designs, especially the hard suits, still look very futuristic.
</li><li> Yoshiyuki Tomino's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon">Space Runaway Ideon</a></em> faces the issue of its protagonist having perhaps the largest afro in anime. There is also the silliness of the alien race, the Buff Clan, wearing futuristic versions of Elvis Presley's wardrobe, which were apparently intentionally done as a semi-tribute to the over-the-top outfits worn by every evil overlord in the 1960s sci-fi B-movies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>'s outfits in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> tended to border on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClothes">Space Clothes</a> anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tezuka wanted his readers to be able to relate to the characters and setting, so he usually only added things like robots and spaceships when they were important to the story. Ultimately, though, this results in what looks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a>, with ludicrously Zeerusty spacecrafts and intelligent robots that run on vacuum tubes existing in what otherwise appears to be mid-20th century Japan, even though the series is supposed to take place in the early 21st. There's an amusing bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> of this in the introduction to one of the paperback collections, where a character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack">complains</a> to Tezuka, saying that since it's the future, he should be wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClothes">Space Clothes</a> instead of a threadbare old suit and living in a high tech space colony instead of a crummy one-bedroom apartment.
</li><li> Oddly enough, the subsequent remakes managed to be even more Zeerusty than the original. The 1980s version tried to depict a more futuristic world where technology was more integrated into modern life, with the result being that the technology's greater presence makes the show's datedness even more obvious and jarring to modern viewers. Even though they got the part about more people using computers right, the computers look totally anachronistic; the futuristic architecture and flying cars they use are often hideously impractical; and all the robots that don't look identical to humans look like a cross between old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Kenner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Kenner">Kenner</a> toys and outdated computer parts. The latest anime from the early '00s is more self aware about this and deliberately goes with an over-the-top retro-futuristic style similar to that used in the earlier Tezuka-inspired film <em>Metropolis</em>. In most ways this is an improvement, but sadly, it sacrifices most of the down to Earth charm that arguably helped make the original such a huge hit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pluto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pluto">Pluto</a></em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse">Ultimate Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemake">remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> by Naoki Urasawa, stakes out a comfortable middle ground here. Most of the robots look like bigger &amp; better versions of ASIMO, modern conveniences that are just now starting to catch on like debit cards and flash-drives are ubiquitous, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolographicTerminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolographicTerminal">Holographic Terminals</a> are fairly common and most of the automobiles look like larger versions of modern Smart Cars. On the other hand Urasawa has restored some of the more domestic 20th-century touches that gave the original its charm. Ordinary things like houses, cafes and flowershops look pretty much like they always have. He also manages to throw in a few bits of retro-futurism that are even sillier than the original, such as high-tech-looking skyscrapers so huge that they can fit <em>entire gated communities onto their roofs</em>.
</li><li> Abundant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a>,</em> evident in many of the vehicles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">SuperRobots</a> in the series. A case that stands out is an episode in which Baron Ashura captures and analyzes Aphrodite A, only for the disc with the data to be destroyed. It's a good thing the villains didn't have e-mail. Ironically, in another episode Ashura stored data in a sort of card that had to be inserted into a computer to display the information stored in it (effectively, an SD/Flash card)....
</li><li> There are other examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em>, but the craziest is Desler's use of a gold-colored mid-20th century earth telephone to argue with Starsha. Gamilon General Lysis composes his report on his first encounter with the Argo/Yamato on an alien <em>typewriter.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em>'s CRT monitors, 90s-like GUIs and BeOS. Also notable is the Dreamcast-like console seen in the OP animation, and the many computers that seem to be running some version of NeXTSTEP, the direct predecessor to OSX. Lain doesn't take place in the future, however, but in "Present day, present time! Hahahahaha!", ie. some kind of alternate reality that may or may not be turned into the world that we know at the end of the show.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the 2008 anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mnemosyne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mnemosyne">Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne</a></em>, where a character in 1991 boasts extensively about the cutting-edge advanced technology of her 486 PC.
</li><li> There's something of a meta, in-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>. The character Vizor/Dark Glass(es) is from two-hundred years in the future, as are several other characters, such as the Three Emperors of Illiaster. Many of these cards have by now been released as cards for the trading card game. Aside from the universe-destroying time paradox this has inevitably caused, the cards...don't stack up to what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> would dictate. On the other hand, in-universe, their energy-bladed duel disks were introduced to the series with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhARCV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhARCV">Yu Gi Oh ARCV</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">Space Opera</a> that features absolutely no noteworthy computers during its entire run. The novels were first written back in the 1970s. Its pilot movie was shown in cinemas in 1988. By the time the series had finished airing in 1999, current technology had outrun them completely, with super computers the like of which the author <em>Yoshiki Tanaka</em> could have never imagined during the inception of his masterpiece.

GPS is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGraphicsWillSuckInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGraphicsWillSuckInTheFuture">fairly primitive</a> (although that is slightly more believable; GPS devices in the present day don't have the sharpest graphics either, since they're purely functional). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">TV series</a> shows that chatrooms are still popular when in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> they've mostly been superseded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendingNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendingNetwork">social networking sites</a>, although geekier types still use IRC.

The show also features prosthetics that are virtually impossible to tell from the real thing (for example, Spike's bionic eye) yet the characters still use firearms that were manufactured over a century ago according to the series' timeline.
<ul><li> The weaponry is possibly more of an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthinTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthinTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, since there are many examples of this in real life.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoldKeyComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoldKeyComics">Gold Key Comics</a> were just as dated, technology extrapolated from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> even though the comics were published well into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>.
</li><li> Dean Motter's works — including <em>Terminal City</em> series, <em>Mr. X</em>, and <em>Electropolis</em> — use this trope, with a heavy dose of savviness and a pronounced tendency to pun. Character names like Tess LaCoyle and Erik "the Red" Haring are among the less egregious.

The alleyway recycling center with huge cubes of shrinkwrapped laserdiscs awaiting processing was utterly hilarious. For as much as it got wrong, though, the film actually got quite a few things right, such as widescreen TVs, video conferencing, targeted personal advertising, video games that don't require the use of hands, tablet computers, 3D movies returning to prominence (just <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hologram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hologram">holographic movies</a> yet), and (perhaps most famously) <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins">a Major League Baseball team in Miami<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and, while a year off, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/back-to-the-future-chicago-cubs_us_581b73c9e4b0b8e11a1358c9">Cubs finally winning the World Series.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Explained in that this was one of the first films where the director deliberately went for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> look. Also, the jetpacks at the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIsland">The Island</a></em> is mostly devoid of zeerust. It takes place in 2019 (released in 2005), where Los Angeles looks pretty much the same, except for efficient high-speed mass transit. Though the vehicles are pretty much all modern cars (no junkers). MSN runs a free database that allows you to look up anyone you need at booths, and the phones and computers are pretty much the same, albeit with more voice recognition software. However, for everything that is perfectly in place, something is off. The police have flying jet bikes with machine guns, tiny spider bots can enter someone's body through their tear ducts to act as a tracking device, and, of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>giant underground colonies where sentient clones are raised for the wealthy as organ banks.</em></span> All this is supposed to come about in ten years?! The one thing that they almost got right was the video game that tracks movement, though the Xbox Kinect never really worked well with anything but dancing games.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun">Logan's Run</a></em> could not look more 1970s if it were set in a disco (bits of it were).
</li><li> A strangely modern example appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a>:</em> K shows J a tiny disc, explaining: "it'll replace CDs soon." Back then, it looked like the logical next step in audio recording medium. But with the invention of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MP3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MP3">MP3</a>, it seems we skipped that "micro-disc" step. The trope is then used intentionally in the third movie, with the 1969 MIB headquarters (as well as many of the aliens inside) having a very Zeerusty look.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang">Fritz Lang</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em> has vid-phones, with 1920s style handsets. Much like Le Corbusier, the cars on the elevated freeways are all Model Ts. The flying taxis are a mix of antique biplanes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic">Raygun Gothic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld">zeppelins.</a> It has ticker-tape machines and antique IBM devices instead of computers, of course.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes2001">Planet of the Apes (2001)</a></em> remake starts out on a futuristic spaceship, yet one from which trained apes are sent on scouting missions. Chimps did play a key role in old 1960s orbital exploration, but were only used to confirm that the space-borne environment wouldn't hamper the anthropoid brain or body, before human astronauts could take their place. Nowadays it's rodents, fish, and various invertebrates that are commonly sent into orbit, while far-flung surveying of the solar system is performed by robots: There's no <em>point</em> to launching apes anymore.
</li><li> It is amazing how they were able to build a fully functional cyborg in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987">RoboCop (1987)</a></em>, while still using floppy disks. Robocop's visual displays are also in monochrome. Even the computers used by the police station and OCP's corporate headquarters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGraphicsWillSuckInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGraphicsWillSuckInTheFuture">have pretty crappy graphics</a>, although that may be because the setting of the film is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture">Used Future</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentRunning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentRunning">Silent Running</a></em> features robots that can understand human speech, yet take their programming from non-reprogrammable cartridges, which our (going mad from loneliness) protagonist has to write new software for, hand-solder the programmed chips onto the boards, and then insert into top-loading bays that wouldn't hold a NES cartridge steady.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SkyCaptainAndTheWorldOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SkyCaptainAndTheWorldOfTomorrow">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</a></em> (2004) is chock-a-block full of Zeerust — not surprising, given that that was the point of the whole exercise. There is a 1930s submersible with a radio-imager that can send pictures back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier">Airborne Aircraft Carrier</a>, giant bipedal robots wreck New York, and the hero's plane can go <em>underwater</em>. The entire movie is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> and must be set entirely between 25 August 1939 and 1 September 1939 because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> is in theaters (released 25 August 1939) but Germany hasn't yet invaded Poland (1 September 1939).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen">Soylent Green</a></em>. Nice arcade machine you got there, Shirl! The film is set in 2022, but Shirl plays a full-sized stand-up arcade game in a swooshy plastic enclosure that couldn't be more 1971 (it's actually the seminal vector-graphics game "Computer Space"). The police callbox also qualifies.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> suffered from this more than the book. In the film version, CRT monitors were prominent despite flat-panel monitors already having been invented and in production by the time the movie was made.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em>
<ul><li> Khan's followers look like the entourage of a hair metal band, with Khan himself resembling an elderly version of Cutter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Elfquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Elfquest">Elfquest</a></em>.
</li><li> The computers look pretty 80s too, although they're at least better than those in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>. In the novelization, one of the Regula 1 scientists complains that a portable computer doesn't have enough memory for his "fifty meg"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1q5pf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1q5pf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1q5pf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's not specified whether he means mega<em>bits</em> or mega<em>bytes</em></span> game. Star Trek later introduced the fictional unit of "quads" to describe computer capacity in order to avoid looking dated.
</li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a>, Nicholas Meyer talks at great length about how dated the way David wears his sweater is, citing it as an example of how "all works of art are inevitably products of their time".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> features many elements of this, being an unusual (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">for the time</a>) combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic">Raygun Gothic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture">Used Future</a> aesthetics. Technology is constantly breaking down and not working correctly, bundles of wire spark frequently, interfaces are all levers and flashy buttons, visual readouts are bright lines and enormous geometric shapes, and holographic visual displays are monochrome with crackling static. And in the very first movie, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">plans for the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject">horrifying superweapon</a> are on "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_drive#History">data tapes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">tapes are still used for some specialised purposes</a>, and can store terabytes of data). The prequels, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenAge">set before</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> forced the galaxy into a constant state of war and deprivation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic">feature shinier and more streamlined technology</a> with next to none of the grit. At any rate, it ducks the whole Zeerust discussion in the first place by stating that the story takes place "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away." Thus, it's not the future and it's not our technology.
</li><li> A curious example appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrangeDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrangeDays">Strange Days</a></em>, which was filmed in 1995 and set in a futuristic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk">Cyberpunk</a> dystopia all the way in <em>1999</em>. While obviously the mind-recording technology that formed the centerpiece of the movie's plot has never shown up, the main character's voice-transcribing answer machine is also not exactly the way that particular technology developed. Neither was Los Angeles <em>quite</em> the decaying urban nightmare just seconds away from exploding into all-out civil warfare in 1999. The fashions are also quite a bit more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk">Cyberpunk</a> than what really went down. You also have to wonder, with the rise in population of file sharing since 1999, why recorded memories aren't swapped online rather than illegally traded on discs by hand. This would have put Lenny out of a job.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timecop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timecop">Timecop</a></em>, was released in 1994 but the future sequences were set in 2004. In that 2004, they had self-driving, voice-activated cars that looked like spaceships, and some sort of cartridge music player instead of tapes or CDs. Widescreen TVs a few years early, too! The music player was a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiniDisc">Sony MiniDisc player,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which was new in 1994 and thought by some to be the next big thing in audio, replacing cassettes <em>and</em> CDs.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990">Total Recall (1990)</a></em>, with its ridiculously bulky CRT-based videophones.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zenon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zenon">Zenon</a>: Girl of the 21st Century</em>, <em>Zenon: The Zequel</em>, and <em>Zenon: Z3</em>, take place from 2049-2054... as writers from 1999-2004 imagined it would be. The first film got some <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/DIq0aaKyAMQ">ribbing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">Doug Walker</a> over references to a "President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Chelsea</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton">Clinton</a>" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand">boy bands</a> still being the biggest thing in music in the future.
</li><li> Done deliberately in <em>Space Station 76</em>, a 2014 black comedy in the style of a "realistic" space setting as imagined in the late 20th century, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarCops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarCops">Star Cops</a></em>. Lots of beige walls, brightly coloured switches, clunky robots, crystal holograms, and old-fashioned attitudes to gender and sexuality.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s early novels for younger readers all have an anachronistic "future 1950s" feel to the society, with slide rules juxtaposed with interplanetary travel, Mars colonies, nonhuman sentients, and a host of other technologies, concepts and discoveries one might think would change American society. Examples include:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaveSpaceSuitWillTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaveSpaceSuitWillTravel">Have Space Suit  Will Travel</a>,</em> there are colonies on the Moon and the hero wins a used space suit in a contest... But the contest is held by the sole sponsor of a (typical) live TV program (a soap company), as in bar soap for washing clothes. By hand. By housewives. Even when Heinlein wrote it, most of his readers were probably too young to remember that. On top of that the chronically unemployed town ne'er-do-well, "Ace" Quiggle, hangs out at the drugstore soda fountain. Drinking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaltShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaltShop">chocolate malts.</a></em>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a></em>, the eponymous Stone family finally tire of space travel and decide to go home and settle down for assorted reasons, including that it is high time the oldest daughter got married. Said daughter is all of twenty years old.
</li><li> In <em>Rocketship Galileo,</em> the eponymous spacecraft has an autopilot that is a <em>shaped cam</em> connected to the controls. Which are, in turn, connected to the damping rods in the nuclear reactor that makes up the ship's drive using <em>mechanical linkages</em>. There's also trans-Atlantic passenger and freight rockets instead of jets. And the existence of the U.N. police has abolished war. Heinlein had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler">Nazis on the Moon</a> too, but given that the book was written in 1947, that probably seemed like the least fantastic element.
</li><li> In <em>Misfit,</em> Andrew Jackson "Pinky" Libby, a lightning calculator as well as a math genius (the two often don't go together IRL), saves the day when the space-ship's sole calculator is on the fritz, gaining him the new nickname "Slipstick" for his supposed mental resemblance to a slide-rule. Earlier in the same story, Andrew saves his blasting team a lot of fix-up work when he notices an error the foreman made in computing the charge of nuclear explosive to use... Which the foreman did with a slide-ruler.
</li><li> And Heinlein's supercomputer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a></em> is intelligent (and sapient) enough to plan a full lunar revolution... But gives all of its calculations on long rolls of printed paper. Ironically, the book did accurately predict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualCelebrity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualCelebrity">CGI acting.</a> The supercomputer is also built on a 1950s scale, to the point that bugs (actual living bugs, mind you) are a threat to his hardware.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarmanJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarmanJones">Starman Jones</a></em> and other stories, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel">FTL Travel</a> is accomplished with the help of books containing table after table of pre-computed values — seemingly no electronic storage or look-up at all. The books didn't just contain look up tables for functions — they also contained the tables for converting between decimal and binary, as all the values had to be converted into binary before being entered into the computer by toggling switches to set the binary values, then reading the binary values from the display lights and converting them back into decimal to make them human readable. This last is particularly strange, as computing devices that did decimal I/O with internal conversion for binary internals had existed for at least a decade when the novel was written.
</li><li> His later works included bits as well. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StrangerInAStrangeLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StrangerInAStrangeLand">Stranger in a Strange Land</a></em> implied data stored on magnetic tapes, missing the rise of hard disk drives. The tape recorder was powered by a tiny onboard nuclear reactor, and was described as "the size of a cigarette lighter," which likely meant the size of a Zippo, not the smaller disposable lighters used today. Essentially, it's a Zeerusted iPod.
</li><li> Used again by Heinlein in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BetweenPlanets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BetweenPlanets">Between Planets</a></em> with the added bonus that the protagonist (who is staying on a dude ranch in New Mexico) takes a call from the mobile phone mounted in <em>his horse's saddle!</em>
</li><li> Rhysling, the hero of the short story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreenHillsOfEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreenHillsOfEarth">The Green Hills of Earth</a>", was blinded in a reactor-room incident aboard an interplanetary spaceship. Whereupon his crew mates "passed the hat," and he was dumped in a strange spaceport to earn a living by busking: the narrator (looking back from an even more remote future) admits that no one would have thought ill of Rhysling if he'd settled for simple begging, since "there was no way then to restore a man's sight"; in a future where planet to planet travel is routine, Heinlein failed to anticipate technological advancements that would increase employment opportunities for blind people. He also turned out to be a genius singer-songwriter, and would've made a fortune in our days. Unfortunately, the story was written good ten years before the concept of a <em>rock star.</em> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a> there weren't a snowball chance in hell that a washed out blind ship's mechanic could make it big in the entertainment business. Not to say that Rhysling wasn't <em>famous</em> — he was. He simply haven't had a penny out of his fame, and stayed a street busker to the end, though it might have do with his personal preferences. The book also seems to ignore something that existed as far back as the 1910s: Workmen's Compensation insurance where your employer (or their insurance company) has to pay you a weekly stipend (about 75% of your pre-injury salary) if you are unable to work as a result of an on-the-job injury, and even where they didn't have Worker's Compensation (as it was later renamed in the 1980s) you could still sue your employer for being injured, same as you can sue a store if you slip and fall due to it failing to keep the floors clean.
</li><li> Heinlein's first written (1938) but last published (2003) novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForUsTheLivingAComedyOfCustoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForUsTheLivingAComedyOfCustoms">For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs</a></em> is chock-a-block full of Zeerust. Of main significance is a cross between a centralized library and a network that handles information and entertainment, but transmission is by speeding up analog signals which are recorded at home then slowed down to normal speed. That was actually used with wire recorders for a while during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> by Allied spies to radio messages from Europe to the UK. What hasn't caught on is everyone lounging around stark naked at home, and most of the time in public.

Oh, and the very fact that a murder has been committed by people who claim to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">evolved "beyond"</a> the petty motives for murder is a pretty big strike on the card as well.

Clark from 1937, has a huge one. The protagonist observes an anti-matter planet, compares his sightings with those of observatories on Mars and Venus, and works out that it's heading for Earth — with a slide rule.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGibson">William Gibson</a>'s 1984 novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a></em>, is unintentionally prophetic in many ways, often because people have read it, gone 'Cool!' at something in it, and proceeded to build it. A lot of the Zeerust comes from Gibson himself knowing almost nothing about real computers when he wrote it on his (manual) typewriter, such as:
<ul><li> A famous and unfortunate moment early on where Case's "...buyer for the three megabytes of hot RAM in the Hitachi wasn't taking calls."
</li><li> The eponymous sentient supercomputer's more extroverted counterpart, Wintermute, disturbs and frightens Case by causing a bank of <em>pay phones</em> to ring in sequence as he runs past them. This is in addition to the fact that cell phones are <em>completely</em> non-existent in Gibson's vision of the future. In his introduction to the 25th Anniversary Edition to the book, Gibson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">apologizes</a> to any young readers who are baffled as to why no one has a cell phone, and who can't imagine what a payphone looks like.
</li><li> In a raid on a full-sensory-stimulation entertainment-industry facility, coordinated from cyberspace with a woman ghost-ridden by a jack-linked hacker as its infiltrator, said woman subdues a security guard before the man can sound the alarm <em>with his <strong>beeper</strong></em>. Wrap your head around <em>that</em> one.
</li><li> Another example is from the novel's famous opening line: "The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel." As TVs back when the novel was written showed gray static when tuned to a dead channel, this description was meant to evoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberpunkWithAChanceOfRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberpunkWithAChanceOfRain">Cyberpunk with a Chance of Rain</a>. However, as today's TVs show clear, bright blue when tuned to a dead channel, the description now evokes a clear, sunny day. Gibson himself said he finds the irony amusing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> parodied the contrast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a></em>: "The sky was the perfect untroubled blue of a television screen, tuned to a dead channel."
</li></ul></li><li> Gibson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeTrilogy">Bridge Trilogy</a> started showing this post-1999. Anyone else happen to remember a gloves-and-goggles-VR Internet coming into existence in the 2000s? Didn't think so.
</li><li> Consciously addressed in Gibson's "Gernsback Continuum", a short story about a photographer who receives an assignment to photograph California's Zeerust-laden "Raygun Gothic" architecture.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> novels, particularly the first one where Arthur, new to space, sees a spaceship and is impressed by how it looks so future-y. Ford, an alien who's been across space and time, is aghast by how garish and out-of-date it is. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeTheUniverseAndEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeTheUniverseAndEverything">Life, the Universe and Everything</a></em> also drops a lead lampshade on the in-setting zeerust of the 'ultra-modern' courtroom where the Warmasters of Krikket were tried for attempting to destroy the rest of the universe, mentioning that this was 2 million years ago, "when ultra-modern meant lots of stainless steel and brushed concrete".
</li><li> Much to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s surprise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fahrenheit451" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit 451</a>,</em> first published in 1953, partially avoided this, portraying an early 21st century society with people listening to music from devices the size of cigarette lighters with plugs that go in their ears, televisions that are as wide and as thick as the walls they're mounted on, and people who are obsessed with their "interactive stories." Of course, he did write a number of short stories (several of those featured in <em>The Illustrated Man</em> being good examples), which described one-piece rockets being used for interplanetary and interstellar travel. For those of you who don't know, modern rockets are multi-stage and designed to separate into different parts upon leaving the atmosphere; this type of rocket goes at least as far back as the Apollo Missions. Bradbury also probably didn't count on the possibility that later rockets would break from the traditional image (a cone atop a long cylindrical tube with the engines on the bottom), i.e. the space shuttle. He also had a tendency in his rocket-based stories to write all-male crews, apparently not considering the eventual possibility of female astronauts.
</li><li> <em>Aldous Huxley</em>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em> posits a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopia</a> where humans with drastically reduced mental capabilities are engineered in a complex of labs... To be elevator operators. Lampshaded in the final chapters, when Mustapha Mond claims that many institutions deliberately use archaic and inefficient technology in order to ensure that there are always jobs for the lower castes. There's also a moment where they use a card catalog. It is also specifically stated at one point that children's games are heavily regulated, and any change in sanctioned games must be to one requiring more equipment (specifically to increase the consumption of goods).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IslandsInTheNet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IslandsInTheNet">Islands in the Net</a>,</em> by Bruce Sterling, has a computer-net dominated future — of fax machines and BBS (bulletin boards, for those too young to remember. The pre-WWW ancestor of the forum). Still, with just a few changes in wording, it could very easily become a believable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>, as it does predict many plausible consequences of information technology.
</li><li> Alfred Bester's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemolishedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemolishedMan">The Demolished Man</a></em> holds up surprisingly well for a novel written in the '40s, mainly by circumventing or just not directly addressing most potentially Zeerusty subjects. However, there's only one computer in the book: It's the size of a room and prints the results of its calculations on paper tape. Despite this, its legal verdicts are weirdly intuitive.
</li><li> The Metaverse of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash">Snow Crash</a></em> resembles Second Life more than the internet (which is essentially what it turns out to be). Though it may be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt">Second Life Imitates Art</a>, Phillip Rosedale explicitly claimed Stephenson's work as inspiration. Also, on a more political front, the United States has devolved into a series of franchises that each function as separate countries, and Japan (or "Nippon") is the undisputed leader in technology and business, as apparently the Japanese economic bubble never burst. It also features a real-time Google Earth, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">wikipedia</a> which requires one to pay for its information.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em> shows a bit of this: apparently, when we achieve faster-than-light interstellar travel and Turing-level artificial intelligence... we will be using DOS again.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HyperionCantos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HyperionCantos">Hyperion Cantos</a></em>:
<ul><li> Managed to predict relatively cheap ubiquitous use of the Internet in 1989, just one year after it was made accessible to commercial groups. On the other hand there are also Hard Boiled PIs.
</li><li> Even more, it predicted the <em>iPhone</em>. Yep. The Diskey is a small, ubiquitous device looking like a screen the size of a cigarette pack, but much slimmer, that you command by pressing icons that appear on it. It's used as a communication device, has a direct connection with the computer network and is your main way to access any medium. The cycle doesn't tell if you can shake it to skip tunes, or if it systematically falls apart by itself after three years use, though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPgraf/Media/valentina.htm">Valentina: Soul in Sapphire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>,</em> a story about a sentient computer program published in 1984, is interesting because it rather accurately predicts the Internet, online gaming culture, and the use of emoticons in text messaging.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRingworldEngineers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRingworldEngineers">The Ringworld Engineers</a></em> (1979) has computers that use magnetic tapes. Built by a race that make floating cities, interstellar ramscoops, longevity drugs, etc.
<ul><li> Later novels in the series retcon the technology, stating that the longevity drug was almost certainly the result of a Protector needing money for a project, and implying that a lot of the other technology might have been passed along by Protectors for similar reasons.
</li></ul></li><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s robot stories, set in the 2000s—and even the Lije Bailey novels, set in about the 3000s—mention characters using slide rules. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Robots can't do math</a>?
<ul><li> Another weird one was that a plot point in one of the Lije Bailey novels revolved around the incredible idea of robots with interchangeable parts. Then there was concern about robot brains controlling starships (especially warships), because it wouldn't occur to them that other ships contained humans.
</li><li> Never mind that, try a robot with true A.I....that can't talk because text (or robot "thought") to speech is too complex. Really, it's amazing how his early robots had A.I. and could communicate in lots of ways, but couldn't talk. They can <em>understand</em> human speech perfectly well, however.
<ul><li> Particularly in the early days of electronic computing, there was a serious lack of understanding of what kinds of tasks are computationally easy and what kinds are computationally hard. It was thought that converting between speech and internal data representation in the system, machine vision, and walking would be fairly simple problems to solve while symbolic algebra and other advanced mathematics would be difficult, because that's the way it is for humans. The reverse is true, because humans are the result of several hundred million years of R&amp;D in doing the former tasks while we've had almost no R&amp;D for the later. It isn't that making sense of the visual world, speaking and understanding speech, and locomotion are easy problems, we've just got very, <em>very</em> optimized wetware for those tasks, while our ability to perform higher mathematics is more or less just a happenstance by-product of abilities that were useful to staying alive in a neolithic culture.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunsOfTheSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunsOfTheSouth">The Guns of the South</a></em> the South African white supremacists arming the Confederacy with AK-47s are from 2015, but the details given of that year appear little different from the late Eighties - early Nineties (published in 1992.) The only apparent reasons for the future setting are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine">Time Machine</a>'s span of 150 years, and the invention of a time machine.
<ul><li> Also in his 1990 novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWorldOfDifference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWorldOfDifference">A World of Difference</a>,</em> set on a larger, inhabitable fourth planet (called "Minerva" instead of Mars), the 1st expedition's photographer lugs along an entire photography lab to print out all the pictures taken.
</li></ul></li><li> Edward Bellamy's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LookingBackward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LookingBackward">Looking Backward</a>,</em> written in 1887, portrays the U.S. in the year 2000 as a "socialist utopia" — actually a top-down military dictatorship. Bellamy's descriptions of credit cards and the Internet, however, were surprisingly spot-on, if primitive.
<ul><li> It should be noted, however, that Bellamy failed to imagine even radio, let alone television. The main entertainment in the year 2000 was sitting around in your living room listening to music piped in over telephone wires. While this may suggest the infrastructure of the internet, the absence of any wireless technology (e.g., radio) is striking. Also, the automatic retractable awnings over the sidewalks is highlighted as an impressive technology which was no doubt feasible when the book was written.
</li></ul></li><li> George O. Smith's <em>Venus Equilateral</em> stories (1942-1945) feature a three mile long, one mile diameter space communications station stuffed with vacuum tubes. The problem of communicating with ships in flight is solved with complicated cams. The engineer heroes work out problems by sketching them out on tablecloths and using their slide rules.
</li><li> The three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RendezvousWithRama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RendezvousWithRama">Rama</a></em> sequels (written by <em>Gentry Lee,</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> contributing ideas) take place in the 23rd century, but we're still using analog tapes for museum tours, and somehow the internet has failed entirely to catch on to the point that they actually send TV reporters and newspaper correspondents on potentially dangerous deep-space missions instead of just letting the astronauts post on their blogs to tell the world what's going on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> was a visionary in many respects, but some of his works share his peers' failure to anticipate advances in computing:
<ul><li> In the short story <em>Superiority,</em> a major plot point is that a spaceship battle computer requires a million vacuum tubes and a team of five hundred technicians to maintain and operate it. The liner carrying the technicians makes an interesting target. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note259e6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note259e6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note259e6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The story was published in 1951, 3-4 years after the invention of the transistor but a couple of years before the first commercial applications.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Earthlight</em> the protagonist, searching for an information leak, finds the moonbase computer with girls feeding it tapes, and a room-full of electric typewriters. He leaves convinced that information could not possibly leak out through the computer, because the hardware is <em>locked away.</em>
</li><li> Also, many stories and novels written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">the 1950s</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">the late 1970s</a> attribute in the near future seen from their perspective (roughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">the1990s</a> to present age) a most important place in world politics, science and global <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne">Julesvernian</a> projects for African and Pacific Islands countries. Even more strangely for a modern reader, this idealistic view of decolonized Africa <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">in the forefront of progress</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">was fashionable prior to 1980</a> (another well known example is the final story of Asimov's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IRobot">I, Robot</a></em> collection), and not just in Eastern European Communist countries.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick">Philip K. Dick</a> books are pretty Zeerusty, but a glaring example is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ubik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ubik">Ubik</a></em>. The characters are in a spaceship, en-route from the Moon to Earth, and they need to make a phone call. Someone punches a search query into an electronic phone book (which is big, bulky device, not simply a function of the ship's computer) which then extrudes a punched-card with the number on it. The card is then fed into the phone to make the call.
<ul><li> Another unintentionally hilarious example is in the earlier novella "What the Dead Men Say", in which it is commonplace for the dead to be frozen an held in a "mortuary" where a certain number of times they can be partially revived enough for friends and family to interact with their thoughts. As fascinating as his ideas may seem, it might seem a bit jarring to modern readers when the characters refer to telegraphs and electric typewriters.
</li></ul></li><li> Used deliberately in the short story <em>The Radiant Car Thy Sparrows Drew</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherynneMValente" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherynneMValente">Catherynne M. Valente</a>, with a documentary filmmaker using being shot off to Venus in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne">Jules Verne</a>-like cannon, and her B&amp;W newsreels of alien worlds shown in silent movie theatres.
</li><li> One second grade schoolbook contained a short story about life in an extremely polluted future. It was told from the point of view of a kid living his normal day at home (school via video and so on). At one point, parents came back home and the mother went to the kitchen and set about making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPills">dinner</a>. Yes, in a world where dinner consists of swallowing pre-made brown ("chicken and gravy") and green ("peas") pills, it's still the woman's sacred duty to take the pills out and set the table.
<ul><li> One middle-school science textbook ended with a series of sci-fi stories. One took place in a future where advanced plastics had made a better world, told from the perspective of kids in that time learning about the "dangerous" past. Despite only having been printed in 1992, it had the kids learning what soda cans and glass bottles were, saying that "it wasn't until around 2000 that plastic bottles completely replaced them."
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomSwift">Tom Swift</a></em> series of books (1910 or so) foretold some interesting developments, such as stealth airplanes (though in this case the stealth related to silence), television, and laser weapons. The <em>Tom Swift, Jr.</em> series of books (50s and 60s) also foretold some interesting developments including pocket calculators, space shuttles and space stations.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanislawLem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanislawLem">Stanisław Lem</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfPirxThePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfPirxThePilot">Tales of Pirx the Pilot</a></em> suffers partly from this, especially with the bigger computers that still have punchcards as input, and satellites communicating with morse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a>'s first novel, <em>Player Piano,</em> (<em>"Utopia 14"</em> in some printings) features EPICAC, a massive supercomputer that takes up the entirety of Carlsbad Caverns National Park.
</li><li> The early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">Pip and Flinx</a></em> novels are prone to this, although the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">retcons much of it away in time.</a> The first one has Flinx don a survival-kit belt that includes a supply of mini microfilm books on spools for his visit to an alien planet; in the second, he's kidnapped by a pervert who needs his psychic powers to guide an animated simulation within a "Janus jewel," the functions of which would be outclassed by your average 16-bit graphics program.
</li><li> Non-fiction "futurism" works tend to become this trope within a decade or two of publication:
<ul><li> The 1970 bestseller <em>Future Shock</em> tells of future housewives who get their hair dried under '50s-style bowl driers that tickle their pleasure centers as they operate, and that the pretty airline counter receptionist who books your flight (because, of course, there's no Internet to buy tickets through) could be part robot.
</li><li> Captured in the 1962 non-fiction book, <em>1975 and the Changes to Come</em>. Some predicted innovations that never came to pass include toaster bacon and punch-card rotary phones.
<ul><li> Toaster bacon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">actually did exist</a>— you can see a PDF of the patent for the packaging <a class="urllink" href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3469998.pdf">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> They had to pull it from the market because some packages leaked grease from the bacon and caused toaster fires.
</li><li> Punch-card rotary phones also came to pass. See this <a class="urllink" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/xmitter/3282077416/">photo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for one example from the 1970s. The advent of widespread touch-tone service was their death knell.
</li></ul></li><li> The more-recent "futurism" work <em>2081</em>, from 1981, correctly anticipated personal electronics and online shopping, but completely missed the mark on how <em>multi-functional</em> devices such as smartphones or home computers would turn out to be. Thus, a tourist from a space colony whose journey to Earth serves as a running demonstration of 2081 life carries a phone, e-reader, translation device, still camera, motion camera, and personal locator on his tour ... but he needs a <em>lot</em> of pockets to do it. His hostess can shop for hot sauce electronically and have it delivered via vacuum-tube, but has to go into the kitchen to access the grocery-shopping computer. When his mother sends him a letter from back home, she <em>writes it out longhand</em>, then transmits a pic of it to Earth.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Orson Scott Card</em>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em> falls under this, imagining that the internet would primarily be a think tank for the world's smartest people and that everyone would use online newspapers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> invoked this trope when writing <em>The Napoleon of Notting Hill</em> and wrote a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> prologue.
</li><li> <em>Kill O Byte</em> by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a></em> has very sophisticated virtual reality... Over dial-up Internet.
</li><li> <em>The Android's Dream</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnScalzi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnScalzi">John Scalzi</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator">Replicators</a> which function a lot like modern 3D printers. Just six years after the novel was released, they already feel dated compared to the 3D printers sold for home use today.
</li><li> The SeeTee stories by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackWilliamson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackWilliamson">Jack Williamson</a> have rocket ships that have to search for their targets using advanced thermal and photographic equipment. Of course that was because they were written in the 1940s, when radar was a military secret.
</li><li> The glove and goggles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualReality">Virtual Reality</a> rigs in <em>Heavy Weather</em> (1994) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceSterling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceSterling">Bruce Sterling</a>. Younger readers may not remember the moment when this was going to be the future of computing.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paratime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paratime">Paratime</a> series is full of this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodySmokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodySmokes">Everybody Smokes</a> like a chimney, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinCanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinCanRobot">Tin-Can Robots</a> everywhere and best of all the ridiculously advanced Home Timelines uses index cards and charts, and tables with models too, and exchanges information by fax. Also women are called 'girls'.
</li><li> The Fortean sf novel <em>Sinister Barrier</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricFrankRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricFrankRussell">Eric Frank Russell</a> (1939, revised 1948) is set in the far future year of 2015. An important plot point is an improved form of camera film, and even in the revised version there's radio but no television.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyRucker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyRucker">Rudy Rucker</a>'s <em>The Hacker And The Ants</em> is yet another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberpunk">Cyberpunk-ish</a> novel in which driverless cars are assembled from kits and VR is widely used for everything from shopping to cheap sex. Yet cell phones (as in <em>Neuromancer</em>) are nowhere to be found, people still need to change CDs manually on their stereos, and the main character's hyper-sophisticated home office has no wireless connections between components, because equipping it with those would be <em>hideously expensive</em>.
</li><li> In keeping with the many struggles that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has had with this trope over the years (see below for televisual examples), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures">Doctor Who New Adventures</a> (and, to a lesser extent, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoMissingAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoMissingAdventures">Doctor Who Missing Adventures</a>) contain many visions of the then-near future that have not aged particularly well. As part of its general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> approach to the franchise, it so enthusiastically leaned into things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a>, virtual reality universes, speculative computing technology that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">isn't quite as impressive these days as people back then thought it sounded</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">leather-clad badasses with big guns</a> running around that almost every page of every novel might as well have a watermark reading "this was published in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The Early '90s</a>".
<ul><li> While hardly free from this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures">Eighth Doctor Adventures</a> tend to be a bit less overt about it, mainly because they were generally a bit more niche and didn't try to chase the zeitgeist quite as much as the New Adventures did.
</li><li> The trope is deconstructed in the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel <em>The Space Age</em>. An alien transports a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScooterRidingMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScooterRidingMod">mods</a> and a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaserDelinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaserDelinquents">rockers</a> to an artificial city based on what people in the 1960s thought the future would be like, but since there's no work (robots and machines do everything for them) and no recreation, they have nothing to do but continue their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobWar">rivalry</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardKMorgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardKMorgan">Richard K. Morgan</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TakeshiKovacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TakeshiKovacs">Takeshi Kovacs</a></em> trilogy is an example of how <em>fast</em> this can happen; Morgan wrote the trilogy from 2002/2005 — just <em>twelve years ago</em>, but still well before <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_bioprinting">3D bioprinting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMetaverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMetaverse">The Metaverse</a> became buzzwords — making his universe's demand for natural aged humans and clones for sleeves look rather quaint. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlteredCarbon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlteredCarbon">Netflix series</a> makes good attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> this with bioprinters being heavily regulated to prevent "identity theft" and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Alternet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Alternet">Alternet</a> full of stack-annihilating malware.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a> book <em>Kingdom Come</em>, technology doesn't really advance much beyond the level of the 2000s throughout the course of the Millennial Kingdom, as fax machines and printers are still in use by the time the Kingdom ends and the old earth is replaced with the new earth. The final book of the series was written and published in 2007.
</li><li> The nonfiction <em>Where the Wasteland Ends</em> (1972) by Theodore Roszak employs this trend for a critique of modernism, invoking decaying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic">mid-20th-century modernist</a> artifacts as seen in the early 1970s.

However, he needs to have floppy media inserted into him regularly, or his programming out-and-out crashes. What floppy media is this? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassetteFuturism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassetteFuturism">A cassette of magnetic tape</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> Needing to find non-military people in person or by word of mouth is definite Zeerust in a modern world where it's impossible to avoid overhearing at least one "where are you?" cell phone call a day. Especially since both cell phone-equivalent technology and <em>telepathy</em> (which would make the question completely moot) were available to at least the main characters throughout the run of the series.
<ul><li> Apparently, the wrist-mounted cell-phone-like communicators ubiquitous among the main characters were a classified military technology and unavailable to the general public.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode featured an individual known as a 'Vicker' whose job it was to record events (including thoughts and experiences transmitted telepathically) onto a data crystal inserted directly into a port in his brain. While the technology itself is plausible by the 23rd century, 'Vicker' was explained as a phonetic pronunciation of 'VCR', a recording technology that would become obsolete less than five years after the series made its first run.
</li><li> Multiple characters are shown reading <em>Universe Today</em>, a print newspaper. Although one episode goes out of its way to demonstrate that readers can select articles of interest and print the paper on demand, changes in the newspaper industry and the advent of portable e-readers since the series aired mean that the appearance of an actual <em>newspaper</em> in the series is starting to look almost quaint even by today's standards.
</li><li> So when was the last time your computer (or even your <em>television</em>) showed you static "snow" when the signal dropped? Happens on <em>Babylon 5</em> all the time. For that matter, while they do have touch screens, the interfaces are ridiculously blocky, over-sized and colorful, almost looking like a child's computer game from the 80s. This is most prominently on display in the fourth-season finale <em>The Deconstruction of Falling Stars</em>, nearly the entirety of which is actually a series of recordings being watched by a man thousands of years in the future. The GUI of his recording program looks horrifically tied to the early 90s. (Granted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">some of it may be so that the ''viewer'' can parse it at a glance</a>, but it's one of those things you notice on repeat viewings.)
</li><li> Speaking of television screens: It obviously did not occur to the creators that general-use video monitors would shift to the 16:9 aspect ratios. In the B5 timeline, all screens are in the old 4:3 format. They imagined a self contained space station, but not a 16:9 screen, especially since ones in personal quarters are <em>shown</em> being used for recreation and television equivalents.
</li></ul></li><li> Tez One from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BadRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BadRobots">Bad Robots</a></em> is designed to look like a fifties era toy robot.

<ul><li> The computers are solid-state, and Avon hacks them by rewiring their circuits instead of reprogramming their software.
</li><li> The word 'online' refers to the computer being switched on, not connected to a network. When a computer crashes while analyzing a plague in "Killer", they can't access another because it's physically located outside the quarantined zone. The Federation is organised by a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer">Master Computer</a> with dumb terminals rather than a distributed network.
</li><li> Carnell boasting that he beat "the best chess computer available" six times in a row in "Weapon" now makes him look ridiculous.
</li><li> "The Harvest of Kairos" features a spaceship <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hermit.org/blakes7/SevenCyc/L.html">closely resembling an Apollo lunar module<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that looked zeerusty even when it was first broadcast in 1980.

On one hand, it was a rare 20th century SF show that DIDN'T have CRTs, but used thin flat screens everywhere. Then again, it also had data being encoded on 3.5 inch floppy disks.
</li><li> The Futuristic Zone from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrystalMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCrystalMaze">The Crystal Maze</a></em> has many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">early Nineties</a> ideas of future technology, with good doses of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk">Cyberpunk</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture">Used Future</a>, and lacking many of the technological advancements made since then.

<div class="indent"><strong>Rose:</strong> Why does he look so... disco? <br/><strong>The Doctor:</strong> Oi! Listen, in the year 5000, this was cutting edge!
</div></li><li> The new series console <em>rooms</em> have been "organic/coral", "relatively shiny and futuristic for the 2010s", and "glowing crystals". The console <em>itself</em>, in its first two versions, had a thrown together old fashioned scrapheap look, with bicycle pumps and hot-n-cold taps replacing random parts. TARDIS interiors are justified in that they're fully customisable by the user, and if they look out of date it's simply because the user wants it that way. On the other hand, modern Who may have Zeerusted itself in the future by referring to the interior looks as the "desktop theme".
</li><li> One of the Eighth Doctor books had the TARDIS crew landing on a city based on these concepts, with foodstuff pills, antigrav beds, a "supercomputer" full of tapes and whatnot. The problem? No civilization in the entire Universe ever created this city... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Time Master</a> had once been helped by a group of kids from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and granted their wish to see the future they'd seen in comics and movies. Since no future ever fitted with their expectations, he <em>created</em> the city for them.</span>
</li><li> Remarking on all of the Sixties Zeerust would be pointless, but a few more jarring examples:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E5TheKeysOfMarinus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E5TheKeysOfMarinus">"The Keys of Marinus"</a>, Ian and Barbara remark that they can't tell what colour the alien world is from the TARDIS's screen, which may be a little confusing to modern viewers used to colour televisions. To be fair, modern viewers <em>might</em> get a hint from the fact the serial was filmed in black and white.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E10TheWarMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E10TheWarMachines">"The War Machines"</a> is made of this, since it is about an extremely powerful computer in the Post Office Tower in the 1960s. The scientist who shows it to Dodo remarks "this may not be the biggest computer, but it is probably the most advanced", the computer is able to hypnotise people, it makes the humans build the most ridiculous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinCanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinCanRobot">Tin-Can Robot</a> weapons, it has prominently mounted tape reels, someone describes it as 'a machine that can think!' as computers were a new concept, it makes tape grinding and spool noises and prints out ticker tape, and it also uses 60s beliefs of what the Internet would be like (being able to communicate with computers all over the world by literally calling them up with telephones)... even the non-standard title text is very, very dated. On the bright side, it does take place in 1960s London, so the theme is appropriate.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mondasian Cybermen, when compared to their modern day counterparts, should be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narmy</a> relics of Zeerust.

Not surprisingly, computer technology and graphics have taken a giant leap backward by 2088. The future looks like it was designed by the same engineers who built EPCOT Center's Future World, which itself is becoming dated.
</li><li> Part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>'s charm is how a lot of the "future tech" weapons look like old fashioned guns. This is exemplified in the episode "Trash", where the antique, high-tech laser gun shown looks like an oversized <em>Star Wars</em> blaster. More contemporary (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>) laser weapons are still quite boxy, and fall into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> category, running off quickly-depleted batteries.

(And so, for that matter, does the entire premise of the series; Lister was put in stasis because he sent a photo of him and his illegal cat to be developed in the ship's lab.)
<ul><li> In a subtle continuity nod, Lister is shown to have recorded a message to himself on a video tape in the Series X episode <em>Fathers And Suns</em>, despite it acting like he's operating a DVD or Blu-Ray player.
</li><li> The dispensing machines have been noticably redesigned from being integrated with the walls of the ship to being free-standing talking vending machines in Series X, complete with buttons. Taken further in Series XII, where they are shown to not all be identical and feature signs and typefaces resembling 70s and 80s vending machines.
</li><li> The "officer's quarters" that Lister and Rimmer occupy between Series III and Series V includes a microwave oven that's blatantly from 1989. Similarly, the exam room set in Series I appears to include film reels on a shelf.
</li><li> Holly's preferred form of locomotion in Series II is a large and unwieldly CRT monitor on caterpillar tracks.
<ul><li> While the sets for Series I-V would attempt to hide the use of CRT monitors by building the walls and consoles around them, the sets for Series X-XII make it very obvious that the monitors are now LCD televisions mounted onto the walls.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> Just about anything from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, which has not dated well with its depiction that control panels in the 23rd century are hundreds of buttons and flashing lights. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a> Remastered</em> undertaking does, on occasion, fix some of these, to the annoyance of purists.
</li><li> Khan's origin story is that he's an Indian warlord/genetically-altered superhuman during the Eugenics War in the year 1996. The name "Eugenics War" itself is dated; eugenics was at the very least on its way into the annals of pseudoscience by the time the show was being filmed, mostly thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> is starting to suffer from this as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarshipLuxurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarshipLuxurious">'80s resort hotel architecture for a starship interior</a>, a therapist stationed on the bridge, wood paneling(!), and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Ishara_Yar">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> haircut, for starters.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "Trials and Tribble-ations," in which the crew time-traveled into the setting of the episode "Trouble with Tribbles," mined a lot of amusement out of the style differences of clothing, devices, and Klingons. While getting prepared for the mission, Dax makes appreciative comments about the "classic 23rd century style" of the equipment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> managed to experience the onset of zeerust <em>during its run</em>; the eponymous ship's desk-mounted flat-panel displays were pretty good at first, but by the end of the series they were looking distinctly clunky. The show also had some fun itself with Zeerust, with a crew member who enjoyed acting out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> adventures of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlashGordonSerial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlashGordonSerial">Flash Gordon</a></em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">-esque</a> "Captain Proton".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> really made things interesting, considering it is a modern <em>Trek</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAestheticsOfTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAestheticsOfTechnology">modern designs</a> yet is supposed to be set <em>before</em> the Original Series. It was a challenge to make their hand-held communicators bigger than modern cell phones yet smaller than the clunky boxes they used. The designers even said that in 40 years, the modern <em>Trek</em> will look like Zeerust (and they're probably right, as our ideas of what futuristic is is slowly shifting from sleek all-metal designs to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsAnIPodInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsAnIPodInTheFuture">bright, white, and very minimalistic</a>). Plotwise, things haven't changed much either: one of the stock patterns of threat in <em>ST: TOS</em> is "Step 1: take away the communicators". Similarly, by 2005 or so, the stock pattern in all contemporary media is "Step 1: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhonesAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhonesAreUseless">take away the cell phone.</a>" Most writers then and now haven't worked out how to create dire circumstance while having reliable mobile communication available (this is why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> didn't get cellphones until the last season).
<ul><li> Lampshaded once in an episode; on encountering the classic Trek starship <em>Defiant</em> they gush at how futuristic it is.
</li></ul></li><li> Trek's computing technology (excluding AI) is absurdly primitive by contemporary standards. TOS has the Federation using hand-sized <em>Microtapes</em> in 2267 when we have MicroSDHC cards the size of a fingernail today. In one TNG episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Wesley</a> marvels at how some machines can possess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">whole gigabytes</a> of memory. (Though to be fair, these machines were <em>nanites;</em> stated to fit within a human cell nucleus [~6µm in diameter] and we don't have gigabyte nanites yet.)
<ul><li> PADDs are more zig-zagged: while they are much more advanced in range, being able to connect to locations light-years away via subspace, they also lack built-in real-time communications capability (in particular no video) and were not capable of running multiple applications, which often resulted in users working with more than one PADD at a time.
</li><li> The signature LCARS interface introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> as the look for all Starfleet ship control panels qualifies. It anticipated smartphone like touch-sensitive virtual controls, impressive as the show debuted in 1987 before Windows 1.0 was readily available for IBM PCs and most home computers were Commodore 64s or ZX Spectrums, but not most of computer graphic user interface advancements like tiled windows and multitasking. LCARS resembles a multi touch enabled piece of DOS software. The idea of touchscreens themselves might also go this way depending on how augmented reality goes in the future.
</li><li> Part of this may be explained / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> by Earth's history in the Trek universe — The 1990s saw the Eugenics Wars which left things a bit stunted, followed by bad social climate and eventually World War III. Technology that developed in the real world didn't in the Trek universe.
</li></ul></li><li> 90s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> does get points for managing reasonably well with most depictions of time travel to the 21st century (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">First Contact</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">DS9</a> episode <em>Past Tense.</em> Most of the clothing was kept simple enough to look reasonably accurate to a real 21st century watcher, and there are references to the internet being more significant.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Tek War</em> was only set in the mid twenty-first century (so about fifty years after it aired in the mid-nineties) but much of the technology currently looks outdated. In particular, their handheld versions of video phones appear quite 90s in design with various controls and switches on them which seem quite unlikely given the advancement of touch-screen technology and other advancements in mobile phone technology. There was also an episode where shopping was done from an interactive version of a home shopping network rather than simply online (and while home shopping networks do still exist, true online shopping wasn't presented as an alternative).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em> once had Red <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">imagining</a> what the future would be like, and it was filled with tongue-in-cheek Zeerust, such as jumpsuits and jet packs.

The Thunderbird vehicles themselves, particularly 1 and 2, are based on aircraft and prototypes that were state of the art at the time the series was produced; TB 1 on the MiG 19 and 21, along with a series of X-planes, and 2 on experimental lifting-body aircraft. And of course everything high-tech has clicky panels, big shiny microphones and chrome plated chrome. Things like internet, mobile phones, iPads, etc. are not present at all in the futuristic world of the Thunderbirds.

Episode "Third from the Sun" contained a shapely rotary phone and a spaceship that navigated with a suspended model of itself (as if to show orientation).

<ul><li> The design of basically everything in the series practically screams "late 1960s" or "late 1960s vision of the future", making it an orgy in Zeerust.

</li><li> The 1994 TV movie <em>Witness to the Execution</em> is set in 1999 and depicts how moral value has fallen to such a low that the execution of a man is a Super Bowl-esque public spectacle (the plot is fueled by the fact that he's innocent and there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Race Against the Clock</a> to clear his name before he is executed). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/PlatypusComix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/PlatypusComix">Platypus Comix</a> derided them for this, saying that a bold prediction should <em>not</em> be set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">five years from the year that the production is made</a>.

The first image we see of 2114 is appropriately sci-fi, with flying cars and everything...and then the camera pulls back to show that it's just a picture showing a 1970s' artist's interpretation of the 22nd century. A little boy looking at the picture says "They got it completely wrong!" and we see that other than slightly fancier buildings and cellphones with holographic displays, things haven't changed all that much. Even the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator">Lemony Narrator</a> voices his surprise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975">Wonder Woman</a></em>: In "Time Bomb", the time travelers, Adam Clement and Cassandra Loren, wear silvery clothes and computers all have big consoles complete with lots of levers and colored buttons. The Earth is a series of domed cities. All of which is very reminiscent of a 1950s view of future.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</a></em>: A game released in the late '80s/early '90s (first edition was released in '88, second in '90) hilariously depicts "cellular cyberdecks" as massive, expensive, and unwieldy. While taking place about ten years from now. The stats for the cyberdecks were listed in real life units: one of the top-of-the-line cyberdecks had a massive 256 MB of RAM and ran at a blazing 100 MHz.
<ul><li> Also, according to the depictions in the game material, the most popular kind of music in the 2010s/2020s is basically an updated version 80s hair metal with cyberpunk-themed lyrics. One of the eight character classes you can choose from is that of a rebellious rock musician called "rockerboy". The game writers must've thought rap and electronic music were just passing fads, as they are not mentioned.
</li></ul></li><li> In ICE's 1990s 'Cyberspace' it is noted that by 2090 <em>some</em> portable phones are small enough to fit into a pocket.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> ship's computers start at one ton for the most basic, 2 program model. If you pay extra you can have an optical backup device. Later versions make it clearer that "tons" are neither a weight nor mass measurement for ship sizes, but a volume measurement, that of liquid hydrogen. This means your 1-ton ship's computer has a volume of a bit over fourteen cubic meters ... a cube almost two and a half meters on a side. Presumably this includes all the control wiring and interface hardware (keyboards, screens, servo motors to actually control the ship, etc.) and not just the computer proper, but still.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>: This is the case with the entire first three editions of the game. Since the game was set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>, every few years they would need to reboot the game to keep ahead of growing technology. For the hacker type class, the original series had deckers that would have to literally plug a wire into the back of their head to go virtual. Later on, everyone has augmented-reality goggles or a wi-fi computer in their head. Many fans, however, are not as happy with this change however, as the zeerust present in the original gave it its cyberpunk charm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> has a hint of Zeerust with comically oversized targeting computers (similar to the Traveller example). In addition, the "future history" of the game was written in the 1980s and featured the Soviet Union remaining a power in international politics well into the 21st century. This history has been reprinted, but not updated, in later editions of the game, so that it references events that should now be in our past.
</li><li> The original Main Book for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em> lists an item called the PC-3000 Hand-Held Computer. It's about the size of a Nintendo DS Lite. It uses one inch disks, has a Dual drive system, and a hard memory of 16 megabytes, and has no sound capabilities. Later versions avert this by saying that the player should assume that it's more powerful than whatever's currently available on the market.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> was designed to invoke this on purpose, to help make the end date of our civilization and the rise of Alpha Complex unclear. Buildings, pills and even the swooshing doors all invoke Zeerust, and then we get talk of cloning and genetics that suggests that mankind was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> when the apocalypse happened.
<ul><li> More like twenty minutes into the <em>past</em>, given Friend Computer's obsession with "commies". There's one adventure in which the commies involved are of the Chinese variety, but for the most part they're pretty clearly intended to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> Soviet type. Although this is a product of the game's origin (first published in 1984), it's easily future-proofed by the idea that the Computer has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect">formed the wrong impression from its patchy historical records.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Narrowly averted by the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Trinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Trinity">Trinity</a>,</em> set in the 22nd century. Computers in that RPG are only one step under true AI, are small enough to fit in a pocket, and are presumed to have most of the capacities of 2011 smartphones. The smallest unit of memory described is the "bloc," able to hold "a large library." The only notable limit on what computers can do is the "Comm Crunch," which states that cellular bandwidth is in very short supply (so the GM can arbitrarily throttle the PC's communications, as needed by the plot). This seems eerily prescient for a game from the 90s! Zeerust only arises in the presumption that computers would still have keyboards, would be strapped to your forearm, and would be called "computers" not "phones."
</li><li> <em>Dark Conspiracy,</em> based off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Twilight2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Twilight2000">Twilight: 2000</a>,</em> was set similar to this. During the Greater Depression most of the technology and design went back to the fifties, unless you were a corporation, or the government, in which case it was set back to the early '90s. Excluding the invading aliens, who used brain tissue of organisms fitted with advanced computer chips.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MyriadSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MyriadSong">Myriad Song</a></em> was intentionally designed that way.

Nuclear batteries are a common power source. And the most common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapon">Energy Weapon</a> is called a "raygun pistol" and looks straight out of a sci-fi flick from the first half of the 20th century.

Computers are big and bulky, unless they're robot brains. In <em>Rifts</em>, this has become a part of the setting's idiom, but it feels a little jarring in <em>Heroes Unlimited</em>, which is ostensibly set in the modern world.
</li><li> Deliberately invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em>.

Not only are the computers hilariously underpowered for a "cyberpunk without the cyber" setting (e.g. "supercomputers" with 64-bit video co-processors and up to 256 MB of user memory), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld">Japan Takes Over the World</a> aspects make the realm a product of the time it was released.

It deliberately encourages GM's coming up with elements for their settings not to base them on reality, but on the goofy ideas of technology in 80's sci-fi cartoons (E.g. supercomputers that use 5.25 floppies).

However, some of the in-universe commentary is taken from discussion groups with names like "alt.bio.upgrade.samurai" and "sci.bio.posthuman.rant". Yes, apparently the 22nd century's bleeding-edge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioPunk">Bio Punks</a> are still using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Usenet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Usenet">Usenet</a>.

The pre-war USA was a <em>Jetsons</em>-esque future where it's the Fifties, but with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun">ray guns</a>, atomic cars and domestic robots. All computers have monochromatic monitors and run on vacuum tubes instead of transistors.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wasteland">Wasteland</a></em>, a nearly-forgotten game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> and the inspiration for <em>Fallout</em>, took place In The Distant Future Of... 1995, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">oops!</a>) reaches a breaking point and everybody gets nuked. Only a small portion of Nevada survives. So far as you know, anyway, since the precipitating event that started the nukes flying was the sudden, simultaneous and unexplained destruction of all communications satelites. While standard equipment is somewhere around the level of the Kalashnikov (the "AK-97," to be specific, a 50th anniversary update of the classic) you eventually wind up carrying around <em>portable nuclear batteries to power your handheld ion cannons</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Wasteland2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Wasteland2">Wasteland 2</a></em> splits the difference between the two through the simple means of having the same vision of the future as the original game (with some minor changes to accommodate the better graphics), comically exaggerated near-future apocalypse as seen from the late 80s, but being made in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap">the early 2010s instead of the late 1980s</a>, so it is <em>deliberately</em> retro-Zeerusty like Fallout.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock">BioShock</a></em> series, the city of Rapture is all designed in a 1940s Art Deco style, somewhat behind the times even by 1960 when the game takes place. Even ignoring the ban on contact with the surface (outside of personally-invited new arrivals) and the unjustifiable expense of remodeling an underwater city, the "space age" designs of the '50s would have been a poor fit anyway.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlertSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlertSeries">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert Series</a></em> loves this trope more than life itself, especially with the Soviet side.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StubbsTheZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StubbsTheZombie">Stubbs the Zombie</a></em> takes place in the 1950s with what they believe will be futuristic technology. There are lots of flying cars, simplistic robots with bare-bones AI but no e-mail, Internet, etc. The game developers make the game seem futuristic... for the 1950s.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a></em>, being a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo">Rambo</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Commando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Commando">Commando</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em> pastiche, stars a pair of musclebound commandos fighting against an alien army in the jungle. The game is set in the year 2633 according to the Japanese canon, but despite the presence of improbable weapons and bases, there's no real reason to suspect that the game is actually set in the future. Because of this, the localization actually claimed that the game was actually set in the present when they brought it to America. This continued until they decided to keep the futuristic setting for <em>Contra III</em> and even then the city where the game starts, as well as the car in the first level, looks late 80s - early 90s.
</li><li> Thought it might not be as obvious as some of the above example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> is an intentional version of this trope, or was at least originally intended to be in the first game. The zeerust it evokes is not 1930s, 40s, or 50s, but rather 1970s and 1980s science fiction. The general colour palate is somewhere between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>. Take, for example, holographic displays in eye-killing 1980 orange monochrome, or luminous pink as a viable colour for armour.

The rounded 'computer' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Fonts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Fonts">Fonts</a>, bright primary colours and segmented digital displays now seem rather dated.

The expo predicts that, fifty years from then, there will be machines that make artificial rain and sun, and vast underground cities. Marty, from fifty-<em>five</em> years later (and had... er, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble">will have</a> seen even further into the future in the movies) snarks that he hasn't been to that timeline yet.

In addition, the buildings of the Engineer class are retro-futuristic as well.

The 80s/90s Cyberpunk action movie setting is replete with props that are then-modern technology with LEDs and neon lights stuck on, bogus computer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a>, and seemingly post-processing added lasers.

The year the level takes place in? 2020 (the game was released in 1992). Despite the year growing closer, there is nary a hoverboard, a floating highway, or a futuristic styled skyline in sight.

</li><li> <em>The Riddle of the Sphinx</em>, from 2000, is ostensibly set in 2012. While most of the inventory items to be gathered are ancient, one "high tech" item - the Cheoptronic mini-robot used to probe a pyramid air shaft - supposedly cost thousands of dollars to manufacture. In the <em>actual</em> 2012, you could probably assemble it from a push-bar and some secondhand Roomba parts. The sequel, <em>The Omega Stone</em>, features a hand-held audio player that looks as clunky as a brick-phone, and requires individual chips for each message played back.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em> series, which was launched in 2002, is set in what is now considered an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> where, at the turn of the millennium, a devastating computer virus that nearly destroyed the world led to the internet being fundamentally rebuilt following the computer industry being completely monopolized and the United Nations (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedNationsIsASuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedNationsIsASuperpower">now a superpower</a>) declaring cybercrime a capital offense.

For example, the wheel is lost technology in the <em>Futurama</em> world.
</li><li> Bender in "Proposition Infinity":
<div class="indent"><strong>Bender:</strong> "Is food finally in pill form? What about pills? Are they in food form?"
</div></li><li> It's worth noting that the series took its name from an exhibit at the 1939 New York World Fair, those fairs being notorious real life examples of this trope.
</li><li> <em>Futurama</em> also plays this trope straight in that many episodes feature 'futuristic' takeoffs on then-current technology, which start looking unironically oudated over time. A 2000 episode about the Internet includes a joke about it took Prof. Farnsworth years to logon to AOL (AOL!), for example. "Kidnappster" (a pun on Napster.com) is another good one - by the time "I Dated a Robot" (the episode featuring Kidnappster) aired, Napster itself was on its last legs, having endured a lawsuit from the government over copyright violations (it would shut its doors later that year). The nature of Internet file-sharing was already starting to evolve beyond Napster by this point. In another episode Amy uses a magnifying glass to operate a minuscule cellphone; cellphones had been getting smaller and smaller by the early 2000s but the advent of touchscreen smartphones reversed this.

</li></ul></li><li> The modern day Venture compound in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> is practically <em>built</em> on Zeerust, from the X-1 (nuclear powered superjet) to the punch card sleeping beds, to the moving walkways, etc... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that "Rusty" Venture is not a very good scientist, and is mostly coasting on minor updates to or repackaging of the inventions of his father, who was very much a 60's Adventure Scientist. He built the X-1, which was cutting edge 50 years previously, and the Venture compound looks like a 60's rendition of the World of the Future.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie">Transformers: The Movie</a></em> and the third and fourth series were set in the far-off year of 2005. The new characters all have 80s future-y alt-modes, although this can be excused as the Cybertronians having alien designs (why robots would transform into vehicles for people to drive is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">beside the point</a>). The fact that Soundwave and Blaster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadSuper">still transform into cassette players</a>, not to mention the fact that the Cybertronian personalities can be stored on <em>five-and-a-half-inch floppy disks</em> makes this trope very clear. Daniel Witwicky's outfit (a jumpsuit with his initials on it) falls right into Zeerust, too.
<ul><li> Lampshaded by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.shortpacked.com/index.php?id=50">a 2005 Shortpacked comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> deals with an inventor who has secluded himself in his own little Tomorrow-Land. It does look heavily Zeerust, but then, most "modern" buildings and fashions in that series tend towards the early 20th century, so who knows how they see it.
</li><li> Historical Zeerust - Terry's friend is helping him study for a history test in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>. She mentions "Come on. Clinton was the fun one, then came the boring one...", ignorant of the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">next president</a> would go on to be called many, many, <em>many</em> things, but boring was certainly not one of them. You can assume they believed Al Gore would be elected. Extra funny in hindsight, since Terry was able to list the presidents up to Clinton, meaning he <em>just said</em> Bush, then somehow forgot there was another Bush.
<ul><li> In addition, while the show correctly predicted the prevalence of cell phones in the future, the phones themselves look more like cell phones from the late 90s when the show was made. The creators even admit in one episode's commentary that they did not predict how cell phones would shrink. If it helps any, you can think of them as satellite phones (which have shrunk, but not nearly as much) instead. This goes double when they somehow continue to work at the bottom of those vast glass-and-steel canyons where the signal from an ordinary tower would be almost indistinguishable from background radiation.
<ul><li> More to the point they were completely unable to predict smart phones and text messaging. [[note]] Text messaging actually did exist when the show first aired, but it was only used to a great extent at the time in Japan. As mentioned on other pages, America was extremely slow to adopt texting compared to Japan and Europe due to US carriers charging exorbitant prices for it (and an entire generation of children constantly getting grounded by their parents for running up the phone bill by texting).
</li></ul></li><li> Additionally the prevalence of disk-based memory storage. Granted that USB Flash drives were just invented as the show was in production, only a few high-end memory 'cubes' were seen.
</li><li> While we are in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU">DCAU</a>, the idea of zeerust was deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanMaskOfThePhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanMaskOfThePhantasm">Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</a></em>; in a flashback, Bruce and Andrea are shown having a wonderful time visiting the Gotham World's Fair, with its lively and optimistic view of the future with standard things such as robot butlers. When the fair is revisited in the present, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it is in ruins, seemingly paralleling Bruce and Andrea's future, and serves as the final battleground for the two former lovers and the Joker.</span>

</li><li> The episode "Goobacks" shows time-travelers from the future arriving in present-day South Park; they have dark pink skin, are completely bald, and speak a strange, guttural, almost "choking" language.

While the House soon faded into Zeerust, one element remained steadfastly resistant to progress: when Disneyland decided to demolish the House, wrecking balls just bounced off the sturdy plastic construction. They had to use hacksaws and blowtorches to dismantle it.
</li><li> Disney once tried to obsolescence-proof Tomorrowland by going for <em>intentional</em> Zeerust — "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tagline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tagline">The future that never was is finally here!</a>" In 1998 Disneyland redesigned Tomorrowland to deliberately go "Retro-Future"... that is, they stopped even trying to be prophetic and went for the future-as-envisioned-by-Jules-Verne look (essentially, part steampunk and part art deco). For some of the area this worked, but apparently it didn't occur to anyone that it would turn what was then Space Mountain, an iconic gleaming white structure visible from a significant fraction of the park, into what looked like an enormous pile of greenish-brown doggie-doo. A notable exception is the Carousel of Progress, which touts a "Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow" that's at least a decade out-of-date despite Disney's efforts. Carousel of Progress is supposed to showcase "cutting edge" stuff in its last scene... the last minor tweak in 2010 finally added a flat screen TV to a scene written in 1994.
<ul><li> Euro Disneyland's version of Tomorrowland went even further, actively promoting the fact it was displaying the future imagined by Jules Verne (having an actor dressed as Verne in the park's commercials), and basing many of the rides on his works.
</li><li> Unfortunately, the Carousel of Progress appeared to have been half designed by advertisers who wanted to reach Disney's paying customers. (Note that this is exactly what it originally was - an ad for General Electric at the New York World's Fair.) Some of the "features" included a long car commercial that people would actually wait in line to see because the screens were mounted on something that looked like motorcycle handlebars attached to a chair that turned and swiveled. Not surprisingly, many of the viewers would hop off the swiveling chairs as soon as they realized the commercial wasn't an introduction, but was actually the feature.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the "New (i.e. 1998) Tomorrowland" features was the Rocket Rods, designed to reuse the old Peoplemover track. In the queue for this ride, a segment of animation depicting "transportation in the future" was played. The late 50s or at best early 60s styling of the clip gave it its own Zeerusty charm. Unfortunately, due to <em>massive</em> technical issues (largely caused by trying to operate the vehicles on the track which had been designed for the Peoplemover, a <em>much</em> slower ride), Rocket Rods was down a substantial fraction of the time and was closed entirely after two years of at best intermittent operation.
</li><li> As of 2015 Retro-Tomorrowland is itself largely a thing of the past. The only <em>deliberately</em> Zeerusty thing remaining other than the odd incidental bit of "bronze patina and gears" decor is the Astro Orbiter, and the Carousel of Progress/Innoventions building has most recently done duty shilling for Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars movies, being used mainly to display props and memorabilia.
</li><li> Tomorrowland has faced Zeerust problems nearly from day one. On opening day the area had two muesums, Monsanto's Hall of Chemistry, and Kaiser's Aluminium Hall of Fame. Both proported to show off the amazing future materials of Monsanto's plastic products and Kaiser's Aluminium products respectively. However, both aluminium and plastic went from exotic to mundane within just a couple of years. The Hall of Chemistry managed to remain open for eleven years, while the Aluminium Hall of Plastics was shut down after only five years.
</li></ul></li><li> EPCOT has been sliding toward this as well, to the point that the original meaning of the name (Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow) and Walt Disney's original conception of EPCOT as a genuine "city of the future" are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">no longer officially acknowledged</a> by the Disney corporation.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5uqse');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5uqse" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5uqse');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One sign of this is that Disney no longer capitalizes EPCOT as if it were an acronym, and it's listed as "Epcot" (it's still a proper noun) on the official Disney World website and in other materials.</span> The original scale model of the EPCOT city plan can now be found as a generic "vision of the future" seen at one of the brief stops on the Tomorrowland PeopleMover ride in the Magic Kingdom.
<ul><li> Said park also had an attraction called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Horizons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Horizons">Horizons</a>" depicting future space and ocean colonization and desert agriculture. Somehow, nearly everything else looked incredibly dated within a decade, including a building that looked straight out of Buck Rogers. Opened in 1983, closed in 1999. The same ride had a room nostalgically presenting the "The Future of the Fifties" as if it were a humorous departure from the sensible, realistic depictions in the rest of the attraction, demonstrating <em>awareness</em> of this trope while still lacking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">self-awareness</a></em> of it.
</li><li> "Horizons" was actually built as an sequel to General Electrics' Carousel of Progress having the same sponsor. The issue was keeping the ride section current and not jarring when you exited in the exhibit space it also had an choose your own ending feature where you could enter the Zeerust future of your choice. This would later show up in Spaceship Earth in an updated form.
</li><li> The current version of Spaceship Earth allows guests to vote an animated Zeerust future to ride through a series of questions and an onride photo system puts their faces onto the cartoon bodies.
</li></ul></li><li> The provincially-owned theme park <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Place">Ontario Place<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a series of artificial islands built on the waterfront of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto">Toronto</a>, Canada became an example of this trope. It was first opened in 1971 to emulate the success of the Ontario Pavilion during Expo 67 in Montreal. Ontario Place has modular pavilion pods above the water and the Cinesphere, a geodesic sphere that is the world's first permanent IMAX theatre. The theme park pioneered the concept of the soft playground, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberyWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberyWorld">a large air-supported mattress for children to jump on</a> (though this playground was removed in 2002) and a large water pad that later inspired numerous water parks around the world. Ontario Place even had a large maze that had both indoor and outdoor sections, which was replaced during the late 2000s. Ontario Place as a theme park closed in 2011, but the Cinesphere still has screenings to this day, though the pavilion pods are closed.

</li><li> The Lamborghini Countach. Now the earlier Miura and 4-door Espada look more modern. Even worse with the eighties versions with their huge wings and flared arches that make them look less sophisticated since newer cars don't really <em>need</em> giant spoilers.
<ul><li> The DeLorean probably belongs here too. Not helped by the fact that it was a dressed-up Lotus Esprit — a car that has aged quite well.
</li><li> While we're on cars, pretty much every American car from the mid-to-late '50s. They're loved as classics for that exuberance now, but when they first fell out of fashion, they fell even harder than the '80s examples listed above. The fact that all that chrome was attached with bolts to holes drilled into the fenders didn't help matters — the trim sporadically <em>fell off</em> when the holes rusted out, often before the car was even ten years old.

It was a huge step forward when it opened in 1976, but its decor has changed surprisingly little since, and the elaborate automatic train control system has started to show its seams (the deadly crash that happened on the Red Line in 2009 has been blamed on failures in that system). Due to budget and time constraints, there are still some 1000-series cars in service, despite being over 30 years old and not having had a major overhaul since the 1990s; they're the ones with the disco-fabulous red/orange/beige interiors.

</li><li> Also along the same lines, many films used Pan American airlines in their vision of the future... either showing Pan Am Space Travel, or something similar. A fact that's worth much amusement now that Pan Am not only fell from grace as the world's airline, but out of existence altogether (they sold off their Pacific Division in 1985 and most of their London operations in 1990 to United, their German operations to Lufthansa in 1990, pretty much every other profitable asset they had to Delta in 1991, and - unsurprisingly to anyone except apparently Pan Am executives - were forced to declare bankruptcy later that same year).
<ul><li> As of 2017, there have been no fewer than six attempts to make Pan Am a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>. There's always a possibility that one of them will work.

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://blog.modernmechanix.com/what-will-life-be-like-in-the-year-2008/">This 1968 article about life in 2008<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> contains some fine, typical Zeerust: automated cars that hit 250mph on smooth plastic roads, all controlled by an infallible computer that has never caused an accident; cities covered by domes that keep them evenly climatized yearlong; moving sidewalks everywhere; intercontinental passenger rockets; four hour work days; housework is done by robots; and a lot more wacky stuff.
</li><li> Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House, a cheap, energy-efficient mass-produced portable home that was never produced because it was butt-ugly. And the Dymaxion car, as fuel-efficient as a modern car at a time when massive gas-guzzling road-boats were the norm, easier to park, and no one bought it because its aerodynamic body looked like a fish on wheels.
<ul><li> People do sometimes willingly buy or build houses at least as ugly as that. Fuller (in the introduction to <em>Grunch of Giants</em>) said the Dymaxion House went nowhere because building codes of the time effectively made prefab impossible.
<ul><li> While building codes have changed to make prefabs more than possible in most places, a home that's fundamentally inextensible (it's really hard to add an extension to a geodesic dome, even during the design phase) and has loads of unusable space (almost everything you might want to put into a room has a rectangular footprint, which makes for a lot of wasted space against curved walls) is a hard sell at best.
</li><li> Domes are also really drafty, leak badly (think of all the joints on the outside and the fact the outside is all roof), and have really weird acoustics (you can hear someone from the other side of the house but might not be able to easily hear someone in the same room). There's a reason why people like Lloyd Kahn, who actually wrote several books on dome construction, no longer think they're a good idea. Not to mention they have terrible re-sale value and most banks are really hesitant about making loans on them and you get traditional construction winning out over futuristic.
</li></ul></li><li> It's not that nobody bought the car — it never even went to production. It turns out that, in addition to being very aerodynamic, the (three-wheeled) Dymaxion was also <em>very</em> top-heavy and unstable. Development was tabled after the prototype killed a test driver.
</li></ul></li><li> The Fascination concept car. First was proposed to use a "boilerless steam engine" (the closest thing to which is a hydrogen fuel cell), then an "electromagnetic association engine" (pure pie-in-the-sky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware">vaporware</a>).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/F6pUMlPBMQA">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> video made in the '50s shows the highway system of the future to have things like heated roads to melt ice, prefabricated bridges, self guiding cars with thermal imaging, truck trains consisting of store shelving, vehicle elevators, underground roadways... and as it proceeds further from reality: floating cars that can follow roads that turn upside down for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">no reason</a>. They did certainly get <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl">urban sprawl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> right, though.
<ul><li> Interestingly enough as of 2014, heated roads are being tested in the Netherlands (along with glow-in-the-dark roads powered by solar energy and friction from traffic); Google is developing a driverless car; rear-view cameras (some of which utilize thermal imaging for night viewing) are now mandatory on all new cars sold in the US; vehicle elevators are in regular use in some car parks and warehouses; and as for underground roadways, the Big Dig certainly qualifies.
</li></ul></li><li> Any New Town generally, and the town of Zeerust in South Africa, which inspired the Trope Namer, in particular. While not actually a New Town, it was heavily expanded in the 1960s under the old Apartheid Government as an example of how wonderful the Republic of South Africa was (for White South Africans). Now looks a bit run down and odd in places, like most New Towns.
<ul><li> Milton Keynes, the first British New Town prototype, is notable for assuming that everyone would have a car and that fussy old-fashioned stuff like railways would be obsolete. The 1973 oil crisis and mounting evidence of man-made climate change put paid to <em>that</em> vision of the future, just barely too late to revise the plans.
</li></ul></li><li> Brasília, the capital city of Brazil, opened in 1960 and designed by Oscar Niemeyer, is a perfect example of Zeerust. Like another planned capital, Canberra, it has some interesting buildings but was built on a scale that assumed everybody would be driving a car. Looking back from a world where unlimited car usage is seen as a bit unnecessary Brasilia and Canberra seem far too overscaled and impersonal.
</li><li> UNO-City in Vienna makes a similar impression to viewers. Like most planned towns and districts of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">1960s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">1970s</a>, it looks devoid of life. The planned structures both in the West and the Communist Bloc were usually built on empty spaces, rising straightly from the ground, which look strange to people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">accustomed for centuries</a> with cramped buildings within walking distance of each other.
</li><li> Various 1960s rail transport vehicles such as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Metroliner">Budd Metroliner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAC_TurboTrain">UAC Turbo Train<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nycsubway.org/cars/soac.html">US DoT State of the Art Cars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the USA and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">the 1970s</a> design <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER200">ER-200<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Russia exhibit this trope. While decades later the surviving vehicles from this era are considered either unremarkable or terribly dated (depending on their level of rehabilitation) at the time they were the living embodiment of the future. In the 1960s most rail vehicles dated from the 1930s and exhibited lackluster performance, high levels of noise, a bumpy ride, concrete floors, wicker seats, riveted carbon steel bodies and very little in the way of climate control. Then came along new vehicles built from shiny stainless steel or aluminum that traveled at twice the speed, with twice the acceleration and featured fully climate controlled interiors with plush synthetic materials and fluorescent lighting. When one of these new trains pulled up it would have been little different for someone at the time to have stepped on board some sort of flying saucer. Sealing the deal were intentional design elements to mimic the then new Jet Airliners.
<ul><li> The Metroliners are sort-of a defied trope at the moment, however: Between the originals (some of which are still in service 50 years later) and their immediate non-EMU cousins in the Amfleets, the design has largely been "the" intercity passenger railcar design in the Eastern US for two generations...if only because no new equipment has come along to replace them. Ironically, however, the newer railcar designs out there look an <em>awful</em> lot like the "sleek" designs from a generation before, meaning that the "Zeerust-ish" designs from the 30s-50s are looking more and more like the <em>actual</em> future.
</li></ul></li><li> The State of the Art Cars best embody this trope as they were specifically designed to be futuristic as to promote to the general public what their transit systems could be like with a little funding. The carpeted, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?7195">pleather and plastic wood interior<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> really didn't age well.
</li><li> Communist Eastern European governments adopted designs based on very clean lines and very hard-wearing materials like plastic-wood for public services like mass transit, buses and hospitals. By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">the 1980s</a> they were not only out of fashion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">but also looked horrible due to wear and tear</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4087422/Cities-ice-westerners-banished-desert-island-Communist-utopia-Amazing-1960S-propaganda-images-Soviet-Union-thought-world-look-2017-centenary-1917-Bolshevik-Revolution.html">This article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a from a 1960 pamphlet about the future of the glorious Soviet Union in 2017. Not only does it fall afoul of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticalMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticalMessUp">The Great Political Mess Up</a> <em>hard</em>, it depicts things that would be simply impossible to do in 2017, much less considered wise or ethical. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a> moment, the Soviets' manipulation of currents and weather conjures images of the around fifty million casualties of the Great Leap Forward.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6q98g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6q98g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6q98g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The four Pests campaign included a crusade against swallows, which the communist party being unaware that they were a crucial predator of pests. The campaign was a success but caused a massive plague of locusts.</span>
<ul><li> As the article points out, it became Zeerust very quickly as the economy of the Soviet Union took a dive it would never recover from after 1964. The idea of the last imperialists being confined to a remote island in the pacific by 2017 would become antiquated with the Cuban Missile Crisis and, to a greater extent, the Kennedy assassination. After these events it was clear that trying to incite a communist revolution directly in the United States, even by accident, would most likely result in the destruction of the Soviet Union.
</li></ul></li><li> Not to mention that some of the technology looks like a combination of a Piccaso painting and the Jetsons.
</li><li> Terminal 1 of the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, which opened in 1974 and looks like it.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dulles_Airport_Terminal.jpg">Dulles International Airport<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> outside Washington, D.C. No disrespect to Eero Saarinen's memory intended. It's a beautiful design to this day, but it's...very 1958.
</li><li> The Hong Kong Police and Judiciary still uses 1.44MB floppy disks for some documents, new governmental computer installations in mid 2011 still have to come with an external floppy drive to read these. The Legco members also received floppy disks before an environmental department policy address.
</li><li> The Austrian made, 1970s Assault Rifle Steyr AUG, while looking rather futuristic with its plastic housing and Bullpup setup then, looks about as old as it is today.
<ul><li> Many military weapons (or weapons putting on military airs) from the 1970's and 80's can come across this way due to their raygun looks and plastic furniture, especially in the case of the many weapons of the brief international bullpup craze. Weapons like the French FAMAS, Finnish Valmet M82, the iconic SPAS-12 shotgun and notorious SA80/L85 are all fairly easy to date for this reason if you know a little firearms history. It certainly isn't confined to this period, however, with weapons like the Belgian F2000 seemingly intending to harken back to this style of firearms design.
</li></ul></li><li> Steampunk in general is founded on the notion of "what's wrong with a little Zeerust, anyway?" Most of the fashion sensibilities are neo-Victorian, and the tech is Victorian-era science fiction turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Crazy Awesome</a> dial.
</li><li> Geodesic domes. For a while in the early 1970s it was thought that these would BE! the architecture! of! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture">The Future</a>! Stewart Brand, an enthusiastic advocate of them at the time, explains in <em>How Buildings Learn</em> why they were not: they're actually wasteful of building materials (cutting equilateral triangles out of rectangular sheets of plywood), they weren't space-efficient (very hard to subdivide internally and with far too much wasted space above head height), they're by nature unexpandable (if the dome isn't big enough you have to build something onto it), and no matter what anyone did, they leaked like the upturned sieves they resembled. As Brand admits, "When my generation outgrew the domes, we simply left them empty, like hatchlings leaving their eggshells."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">Scientology</a> scripture is loaded with this. "H-bombs", Douglas DC-2s, passenger trains, and fedoras fill the universe and have for millions of years. Alien races are explicitly stated to look, dress, and live like human beings of the 1940s and 1950s, fedoras and all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">and to have done so for millennia</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">ENIAC-era computer terminology is also heavily used</a>. Even worse, Scientology has spaceplanes that look like "Douglas DC-8s without propellers."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7yhe0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7yhe0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7yhe0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The DC-8 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustPlaneWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustPlaneWrong">is a jet plane.</a></span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a> has a state museum of technological wonders like microwave ovens and cell phones from the 90s. Considering that the cities look like South Korean cities in the 60s, and the rest of the nation is dominated by Victorian era architecture, this isn't that surprising.
</li><li> A film made by the British GPO in the '60s (back when the Post Office was in charge of the telephone network!) entitled <em>Telecommunications Services For The 1990s</em> (<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/EUcF_OuV19k">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) makes a lot of interesting predictions about future developments... such as terminals (with wood paneling!) which would have high resolution color video (over a decade too soon), 'computer services' that look remarkably like Prestel (because of course there would be no home computers and emerging Internet) and answering machines based on standard Compact Cassettes (very '80s)! Not to mention the questionable<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8snut');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8snut" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8snut');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">i.e. possibly dangerous</span> ultraviolet light system for copying documents onto photosensitive paper (what, no fax machines?), the user ID cards, and the fact they're still wearing '60s fashions.
<ul><li> A data service incorporated into TV signals and looking like Prestel makes sense. It was developed by the British GPO in only the decade after the film was made. They may well have used the same development materials as a template for how it should look. Wood (or faux wood) paneling was used on some home electronics in the 70s as well (most memorably, on the original Atari 2600 console).
</li></ul></li><li> Science's tendency towards zeerust depends on how fundamental each discipline is. A book on physics from 20 or so years ago will still be fairly useful today; less so anatomy or chemistry. Astronomy and paleontology, on the other hand, should be considered instant zeerust. <em>Any</em> illustrated book on the Solar System published before last year should, by definition, be considered dated; any made before the 2000s should be treated with suspicion; any from before the 1960s is <a class="urllink" href="http://mapsontheweb.zoom-maps.com/image/131490629526">not even good scifi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Ditto dinosaurs. Any illustrated dino encyclopedia published more than a decade ago should be considered of historical value only.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/syQUFnvA5nc">This film<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> describing the Billingham Forum sports and leisure complex, and the rest of the town centre in Billingham, a small town in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthEastEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthEastEngland">North East England</a>. Listen to the commentary describe how modern and forward-thinking the town centre supposedly is. Apart from the obvious postwar ideas of modernism (and the fact that one snide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> commenter on another video likened it to a tourist attraction for those nostalgic for Honecker's East Germany), anyone who knows Billingham will know how abandoned and run-down it has become, how parts of what you see in the video (including the nightclub) have been knocked down, and the Forum itself has undergone a fairly substantial makeover in recent years.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://maritime.org/tour/savannah/">NS Savannah<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was the first nuclear powered surface vessel built in the United States, functioning as a hybrid cargo passenger ship meant to spread interest in nuclear power. Her designers thought ships in the future would look a lot like her, and of course use nuclear power<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note92btk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note92btk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note92btk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She had been designed from scratch with poor economic performance - too small cargo capacity, too large crew, specific and very expensive training to handle nuclear propulsion - since she was supposed to be a technological demonstrator, not a true revenues-earning ship. Testimonies of former crewmen from US Navy nuclear-powered ships of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">the 1970s</a> usually complain of similar problems: nuclear power plus very complex, 600psi steam machinery always spell more trouble than any oil-burning vessel</span>. Suffice it to say, she was the only ship ever to be given an Atom Punk interior and no nuclear civilian vessels have been built in America since. They did surprisingly predict that cruise ships would use white paint though.
</li><li> Arguably inverted with many passenger and military airplanes. For example, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747">Boeing 747<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> perfectly passes for a modern passenger plane to the casual eye, yet was quite incredibly first produced in 1968. The same can be said of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon">F-16<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, first produced in 1973 and so successful that it's still being used today, over 40 years later. Your mileage may vary on whether the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird">Lockheed Blackbird<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (produced in 1964) looks futuristic or retrofuturistic, but it's still undeniably badass.
<ul><li> In fact, it may be <em>because</em> they are still used that they still look "modern". <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_jet_fighter">The most recent generation of fighter aircraft<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> look "properly" futuristic, but are still too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> to see wide use, so it will be a few years yet before the F-16 starts to look Zeerust-y.
</li><li> Arguably played straight with the A-10 Thunderbolt II. Plenty of observers have remarked that the overall design of the aircraft makes it look like something out of World War II, with its prominent externally-mounted jet engines, straight-wing design, rounded nose and prominent bubble canopy cockpit. It's a notion only reinforced by the frequent depictions of these planes bearing shark teeth nose art like those of the warbirds of yester-year.
</li><li> Played even straighter by the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_Starship">Beechcraft Starship<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a private turboprop plane developed in the early 1980s. It looked extremely futuristic at the time, and still does today, but it was a financial flop. It was supposed to showcase new technology that was seen as futuristic for a civilian plane, such as composite materials, canards, and pusher propellers. Unfortunately for the Starship, within a few years more conventional planes had advanced beyond its level, leaving it as little more than a novelty.
</li></ul></li><li> Any use of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_(typeface)">Westminster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> font after about 1990 = instant Zeerust. These days, you'd probably use <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-A_font">OCR-A<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (other than being monospaced, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-B">-B variant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with its rounded letters isn't especially distinctive) or something based on the letters from 8-bit consoles like the NES for a "computery" font, if you bothered to come up with something at all.
</li><li> In the fifties through seventies, politicians loved brutalist architecture because they wanted to be associated with an idealized vision of the future. It became dated quickly, and many people found it to be, well, brutal.
