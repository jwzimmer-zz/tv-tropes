It might not be explicitly mentioned, possibly even outright denied, but anyone called the doctor seems to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenHeartDentistry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenHeartDentistry">able to deliver any and all surgical operations</a> and medical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">technobabble</a> required by the plot. There are no exceptions (well, other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">THE Doctor</a>). All those other guys who've got doctorates in science, law and philosophy are helpfully distinguished from <em>real</em> doctors with vaguely-academic titles like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor">professor</a>", if they're even awarded one at all.
</p><p>This trope stems from a modern convention: in the past, "Doctor" had a purely academic connotation — the word itself derives from the Latin <em>doctor</em>, meaning "teacher", meaning that the title-holder is licensed to lecture at a university on the subject they have a Doctorate in. Later, the meaning of the word <em>Doctor</em> narrowed down to mean that the holder has a doctorate degree: M.D. = <em>Medicinæ Doctor</em> (Doctor of Medicine), or Ph.D. = <em>Philosophiæ Doctor</em> (Doctor of Philosophy). At some point, the word (in English, at least) began to shift from being the title of a learned person/a person with a doctorate to meaning the same as "physician". Originally, the M.D. was a doctorate in medicine, but in some places, like the US and Canada, it became the first professional degree. (In the UK and Ireland bachelor of medicine &amp; surgery  primarily abbreviated as MB ChB, though it can vary depending on university  are the first <em>undergraduate</em> degrees; holders are addressed as "Doctor" regardless. Meanwhile, surgeons  which require a graduate degree, equivalent to a North American MD in length of education  are only addressed as Mr, Mrs, Miss, or Ms in a form of reverse snobbery.)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06432');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06432" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06432');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Historically, being a doctor (the equivalent to GP today) was considered a more upper-class and gentlemanly career than surgery, as they do not have to get their hands dirty. Most surgeons were simply working-class barbers. This was in fact the origin of the iconic barber's pole, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">dates back to medieval times</a>; the red stripe represents bloody bandages, with the blue stripe being a much more recent addition that began in the United States (due to the national colors) and has spread from there. However when the modern era rolled around and surgery become a more specialized and prestigious line of work than <em>mere</em> doctoring, the surgeons refused the title of Doctor as a sort of passive-aggressive middle-finger to the snobs who denied them the title 300-ish years previously.</span> It is easy to see how the term "doctor" was slowly divorced from its academic roots. This has gone so far that it is common for it to be thought that "real" doctors are physicians... which brings us to this trope. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MDEnvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MDEnvy">M.D. Envy</a> to boot.

A psychiatrist or forensic pathologist will necessarily have a medical doctorate, but their main occupation isn't taking care of people's cuts and sniffles. If they're suddenly forced to act like that kind of doctor  like, say, they're on hand when someone gets hit by a car  expect them to act awkward and unsure before they save the day. In all likelihood, after all, it's been years since they had to give much thought to the treatment of physical injuries.

An example would be Chinese, where the medical professionals are addressed as <em>[Surname] yīshēng</em> while academics get <em>[Surname] bóshì</em>. In languages that don't have the distinction, the use of "Doctor" by non-MDs varies with culture: in English-speaking cultures it is often considered pretentious or deceptive for people with non-medical doctorates to use the title "Doctor" outside an academic context, but in some countries like Germany and Italy, it is almost always used.

To emphasize the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a> nature of Starfleet, it is apparently <em>not</em> appropriate to address them by their rank (if any). Further, as a psychiatrist, Deanna Troi is likely a Doctor as well, <em>sort of</em> that kind.
<ul><li> Troi's title is Counselor, meaning she probably filled the role of a guidance counselor of sorts to the crew (more of a psychologist's job, and while they are doctors in the Ph.D. sense, her empathic nature helped her more than her training). Also, the official medical doctors all were required to learn multiple alien anatomies as well as forensics and other analysis. McCoy is pretty dependent on his lab in the original, but in space the doctors have to be able to cope with an emergency. After all, Klingon anatomy has double- or triple-redundancies to keep them fighting and Vulcans have their heart in their abdominal cavity, so why risk being underprepared?
</li><li> Surprisingly, McCoy admitted in "Journey to Babel" that he's really not very experienced with performing surgery on Vulcans, and would rather not risk the life of Spock's father by having to do the operation himself. As he explains, he <em>is</em> technically trained to do it, he knows where all the organs are - but that's no substitute for years of hands-on surgical experience. In short, he's a generalist for an entire multi-species crew, but realistically he'd rather let a specialist do it.
</li><li> All of these doctors (aside from Phlox, who's not an actual member of Starfleet, and <em>Voyager</em>'s Doctor, who's a hologram) do have ranks, designated on their uniforms. McCoy was a Lt. Commander, for example. Troi, who does not wear a uniform, held the rank of Lt. Commander for most of the show and got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> of not wanting to intimidate her clients because she out-ranked them. (Granted, what she was wearing instead was probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">off-putting in other ways</a>) Crusher was a Commander. Bashir was a Lieutenant.
</li><li> Medical doctors in Starfleet don't get addressed by their rank, probably because they are not (usually) considered part of the "command" crew as such (not physically part of the "bridge" crew) and are thus relatively low in the <em>official</em> chain of command - in terms of succeeding as Acting Captain if the current Captain is killed, incapacitated, or missing. While McCoy is <em>technically</em> a Lt. Commander, both Lt. Sulu <em>and</em> Lt. Uhura are actually ahead of him in succession to the captain's chair.
<ul><li> Even <em>Voyager</em>'s Doctor eventually got a DLC turning him into the Emergency <em>Command</em> Hologram, temporarily replacing his medical database with a tactical one (and yes, he was able to use it effectively, employing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet">Shoot the Bullet</a> tactic used once by a Romulan commander to disable two enemy ships).

Jeremy revealed that he had obtained a cheaper quote for insurance because he called himself 'Doctor', rather than a journalist - the two pay vastly different rates of Car Insurance.

The character Howard has a Masters in Engineering, which leads to plenty of jokes at his expense for <em>not</em> being a doctor. Of course, there are a few occasions where people mistake their title as being medical doctors: "A doctor doctor or <em>your</em> kind of doctor?"
</li><li> In one episode, Sheldon gives Leonard medical advice in his usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> manner. Leonard sarcastically responds, "Thank you, <em>Doctor</em> Cooper." As usual, Sheldon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind">doesn't get it</a> and confusedly replies, "You're welcome, <em>Doctor</em> Hofstadter." In another episode, someone (a police officer) who just learned Sheldon is a doctor is reassured by Leonard with "Don't worry, not the kind with access to drugs."

<ul><li> However, her boss, Dr. Camille 'Cam' Saroyan, is a forensic pathologist—and, thus, is <em>that</em> kind of doctor (though that isn't her day job).
</li><li> In one episode, when Brennan is introduced as Doctor Brennan to a physician, he immediately asks "M.D.?", to which she replies "<em>Ph.</em>D". The physician then makes a snide remark about academics, which is rather galling considering an academic doctorate is often harder, and almost always requires more time to obtain than a medical one.
<ul><li> In addition, physicians couldn't even become physicians without Ph.D-holding professors (Biology, Chemistry, and/or Physics knowledge needed for MCATs/Med school).

Possibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">borderline case</a>, since psychiatrists (MDs who complete residencies and board certification in mental illness) are commonly conflated with non-MD-holding mental health professionals such as psychologists and social workers.

The joke may be that no one takes psychiatry seriously, or that nobody takes them seriously because they're more concerned with money and reputation than helping people with serious mental illness.
</li><li> Lampshaded in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>, where Frasier looks at a bar patron's injured leg and tells him how to treat it, then turns to Lilith and says, "See?

<ul><li> One time, when the gang was at a hospital:

<div class="indent"><strong>Ross:</strong> You're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like, "Day one: Floss. Day two: Here's your diploma!"
</div></li></ul></li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Santana</a> and Brittany go to Carl's office for a "cleaning" (read: to get high off anesthesia).

Tropers are advised <em>not</em> to speak to actual dentists this way.
</li><li> Used in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains">Growing Pains</a>,</em> where Dr. Seaver has to help a young girl during her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInAnElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInAnElevator">Born in an Elevator</a> moment.

This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, given that you have to earn an M.D. to be a psychiatrist.

In almost every case, it was made clear that their doctorates were in scientific fields like physics, chemistry, metallurgy and others. One example, however, stands out - the episode "The Assassin," when General Burkhalter brings a Dr. Vanetti to camp. At first Klink thinks he is a physician, but the General quickly corrects him quoting the trope name word for word. Although it is never stated outright what his doctorate is in, Hogan quickly deduces that he must be a doctor of atomic physics.
</li><li> There was an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace">Lost in Space</a></em> when aliens mistook Dr Smith for a medical doctor, despite his protests otherwise.

Dr. Linda Martin is a licensed M.D. as a requirement to be a practicing psychiatrist, but she doesn't actually practice medicine. Her last real medical experience was her medical education years ago.

<ul><li> This comes up a few times, but Dr. Daniel Jackson (PhDs Archaeology, Anthropology, and Linguistics) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> is the best example, while his equivalent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> is Dr. Rodney McKay (PhDs in Physics and Mechanical Engineering; he has noted his disdain for medicine, despite becoming best friends with one medical doctor and falling in love with another). Other examples include Dr. Bill Lee, a consulting scientist for the program; it is never entirely clear what his degree is in, but it's definitely not in medicine. He usually helps with whatever scientific crisis is most at hand during that episode.
</li><li> A weaker example is Samantha Carter, who holds a PhD in Astrophysics and realistically could go by Dr. Carter, but due to the greater emphasis on her military role she goes by her rank instead. However, in early episodes she is occasionally called Captain Doctor. (During her introductory scene, she specifically points out to her superior Colonel Jack O'Neill that she should be referred to by her rank of Captain rather than by her salutation of Doctor. She later proceeds to introduce herself to Dr. Jackson as "Doctor", to which O'Neill quips, "I thought you wanted to be called 'Captain'.")
</li><li> This is played for laughs in one episode. A man who has captured SG-1 is injured, and asks Daniel to patch him up. Daniel explains that he doesn't know how.
<div class="indent"><strong>Aris Boch:</strong> Dr. Jackson, if you don't mind... <em>[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">sees Jackson's puzzled stare</a>]</em> treating my wound. <br/><strong>Daniel:</strong> I'm an archaeologist. <br/><strong>Aris Boch:</strong> I know, but you're also a doctor. <br/><strong>Daniel:</strong> <em>[a beat]</em> ...of archaeology. <br/><strong>Aris Boch:</strong> <em>[sigh]</em> Never mind...
</div></li><li> Sam ends up patching him up with a first-aid kit due to her field medical experience, despite the fact that she's Not That Kind of Doctor either. She just learned it through military training.
</li><li> Though normally this doesn't come up for Sam, it does occur when an alternate-timeline version of her introduces herself to the alternate version of Daniel.
<div class="indent"><strong>Daniel Jackson:</strong> <em>[offering his hand for her to shake]</em> Doctor Daniel Jackson. <br/><strong>Samantha Carter:</strong> <em>[shaking his hand]</em> Doctor Samantha Carter. <br/><strong>Daniel Jackson:</strong> Oh! Uh, PhD. <br/><strong>Samantha Carter:</strong> Oh, me too.
</div></li><li> In "Harmony", a girl believes that Rodney should know something about, well, being a doctor. His response is similar to Daniel's above.
</li><li> This come up again in Rodney's panicked rant in season 5 about why he can't deliver a baby. Note that this didn't prevent Daniel from delivering a baby on two separate occasions  three if you count one mentioned off-screen. He was much more calm about it.
<ul><li> In the first birth Sam was also looked to for help, but this could also have been because she's a woman and in that case would not <em>necessarily</em> be an example of this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> A (Subverted?) example in <em>Atlantis</em> season 5 when Daniel is kidnapped by a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and apparently assumed to be a physicist since he was doing research in an Ancient physics lab. (He was actually there studying the files and history.) His response in this case is that he is Not That Kind of Doctor. Fortunately, Rodney was captured with him and actually <em>is</em> a physicist, so they are able to solve the problem.
</li></ul></li><li> The telemovie <em>To Catch A Killer</em> (1992) reminds us that this trope applies to the legal profession too. The police are searching the apartment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">John Wayne Gacy</a> and want to confiscate something for evidence.

As no one comes, they start speaking of a "hypothetical doctor" with a hypothetical sandy mustache hypothetically sitting in the seventh row. The man eventually comes, and recommends a bridge. A tunnels obviously out of the question, but if they really need to get past the passenger, they could use a couple of drinks trolleys and a stretcher to rig up a rudimentary cantilever bridge.

<ul><li> Perhaps the most notorious Nazi "doctor," Josef Mengele, had a PhD in anthropology from the University of Munich and was an assistant at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">Institute for Hereditary Biology and Racial Hygiene</a> in Frankfurt. He got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower">Drunk with Power</a> when assigned to Auschwitz, where he performed gruesome human experimentation, particularly concerning twins and usually without anesthetics, that produced no viable scientific results, or indeed any results beyond satisfying his morbid curiosities. Oddly, he <em>did</em> have a medical degree, but his only medical experience prior to his butchery at Auschwitz was as a combat medic for the Wehrmacht. Most of his work was devoted to pseudoscientific genetic research. Probably the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> of this trope you'll ever see in real life.
</li></ul></li><li> People with two doctorates may demand to be addressed as Doctor Doctor X (although it's kind of cumbersome and no one actually ever does so). People with a professorate and a separate doctorate generally <em>will</em> be addressed as Professor Doctor, though not usually in everyday conversation. On the other hand, some teachers with a doctorate or professor's degree at some universities and schools don't insist on being called "Professor/Dr. (name)", and even discourage it in many cases. At many other colleges and universities, however, "Doctor So-and-so" or "Professor So-and-so" is the established way for a student to address their doctorate-holding instructor, and to do otherwise would come across as, at worst, very rude.
</li><li> Benjamin Franklin managed to fall into this trope, despite not being EITHER kind of doctor. Although he was almost universally addressed as "Dr. Franklin," all his degrees were honorary, presented for his groundbreaking scientific achievements (along with an honorary Doctor of Laws). Franklin never attended college and had only two years of formal education, period; he was otherwise self-taught.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll">Uwe Boll</a> also has a doctorate in literature. Good luck finding an unironic mention of him as "Doctor Boll", though.
</li><li> Doctoral students everywhere. After going through the very long, sometimes soul-sucking process of actually getting that PhD, you damn well want some acknowledgment for it. And yet the public insists on thinking that all doctors are physicians.
</li><li> The radio talk therapist Dr. Laura Schlessinger is a doctor of physiology, not psychiatry. Not false advertising exactly (she's perfectly entitled to put Dr. before her name), but misleading. Though it should be noted that after she began dispensing personal advice on the radio, she obtained training and certification in marriage and family counseling from the University of Southern California, and a therapist's license from the State of California. In addition, she opened up a part-time practice as a marriage and family counselor.
</li><li> Aversion: <em>Every</em> university graduate in Italy is referred to as "Dottore" or "Dottoressa." Unless, that is, they have some more prestigious title, such as "Avvocato" (lawyer) or even better, "Ingegnere" (engineer.) It's so pervasive that many people will tend to automatically address as "dottore" someone who seems to be of high status. Also, even some non-graduates may be addressed by a title if their profession commands respect: the most common example is "Geometra" (a skilled construction technician, who has authority to approve some civil engineering projects).
</li><li> Similarly, in Egypt, people with degrees may be called "Ustaz" ("professor") or "Doktor" in informal settings, even if they aren't professors or have doctorates. Also played straight, because in Egypt, medicine is a seven-year bachelor's degree, and not a doctorate, but people colloqually call physicians without advanced degrees "Doktor" all the same—and are more likely to do so than with, say, someone who holds a bachelor's in something like literature or psychology.
<ul><li> Also: An actual engineer won't be called "Mohandis" ("engineer"), since that's the title for certain kinds of skilled worker (well, "Bash Mohandis," i.e. "Chief Engineer" is), like electricians.
</li></ul></li><li> An English speaker in France may hear the word <em>physicien</em> and think it refers to a physician; it's actually French for "physicist". The best translation of "physician" would be <em>médecin généraliste</em>, though <em>médecin</em> is enough if any kind of M.D. will do.
</li><li> Dr. Phil is not a medical doctor, but has a doctorate in psychology. He also has no license to practice, having officially retired in 2006. Apparently his TV show counts as "entertainment" rather than "psychology", so it's not against the law for him to continue hosting it.
</li><li> The degree handed out by law schools in the United States is called a <em>Juris Doctor</em>, and yet no one ever refers to lawyers as "Doctor". The profession is somewhat ambiguous about whether it's appropriate to use the title "doctor," the general consensus being "<em>technically</em> it's allowed, as long as you're not giving the impression that you're an expert in a field other than law." This is most commonly a concern for medical malpractice or personal injury lawyers, for whom it can be falsely inferred that they are medical doctors as well as lawyers (although some lawyers are indeed both). Most lawyers don't bother, to forego the risk of seeming pretentious. There are also advanced terminal doctorates in law such as the Doctor of Juridical Sciences or the even more prestigious Doctor of Laws, but these are very rare except as honorary degrees.
</li><li> Vice president Joe Biden's wife Jill being criticized for using the title <a class="urllink" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-dr-jill-biden2-2009feb02,0,548459.story">because she's not that kind of doctor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Nutritionist Gillian McKeith, who announced that she would "voluntarily" stop calling herself Dr. Gillian McKeith on the grounds she wasn't a medical doctor. This came just before the Advertising Standards Authority insisted that she stop calling herself "doctor" because the college she got her PhD from was "not accredited by any recognised educational authority". So not only was she Not That Kind of Doctor, but she wasn't even a doctor either.
<ul><li> Science author Ben Goldacre made fun of this by referring to her as "Gillian McKeith, or, to give her full medical title, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchComment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchComment">Gillian McKeith</a>."
</li></ul></li><li> There was once a controversy in the letters page of the <em>Financial Times</em> as to whether an individual was entitled to be addressed as "Dr" or not, with the paper taking the position that they would award the title to Ph.D.s but only if the <em>FT</em> had seen proof that the individual had completed a doctorate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">One reader commented that they should check whether surgeons had earned the title of "Mr."</a>
</li><li> Dr. Susan Block, best known for her sex advice, got her graduate and post-graduate degrees in philosophy, though "with an emphasis in psychology" and her undergraduate degree was in theater studies.
</li><li> Theodor Geisel, AKA "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss">Dr. Seuss</a>", isn't a doctor at all; the "Dr." is merely a pen name.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento">Dr. Demento</a> is just a stage name for musicologist Barry Hansen. Interestingly enough, he does have a graduate degree in his field; despite his madcap persona, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">he boasts a rather sophisticated portfolio of work on music theory and music history</a>. He himself has suggested that he would have gone on to acquire his doctorate had his radio career not taken off.
</li><li> Dr. Ruth Westheimer has actual doctorates, but they're in sociology and psychology. The closest she gets to medical credentials is her post-doctoral research in human sexuality.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllTheLittleGermanies">Field Marshal Blücher</a> was given an honorary doctorate (in law) by Oxford University. But then his work <em>did</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">contribute to medical science</a>. And to law, although more about about which law applied where rather than what that law actually says.
</li><li> Duke of Wellington who was similarly honoured the same day, June 14, 1814. Blücher at the time joked that if they made him an honorary doctor they should also make Gneisenau, his chief of staff, an honorary apothecary. He and Gneisenau got honorary doctorates (in philosophy) from Berlin University later that year.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrDre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrDre">Dr. Dre</a> did not attend any university. He does have an honorary degree in Street Knowledge, though.
<div class="indent"> "Dr. Dre can suck my dick, that bitch got no PhD.
</div><div class="indent"> I lost track of mine, I got stupid whack degrees."
</div><div class="indent"> <em>— MC Hawking, "The Mighty Stephen Hawking"</em>
</div></li><li> Despite his claims to the contrary, creationist Kent "Dr. Dino" Hovind does not hold a valid doctorate. He bought his "degree" from a non-accredited "university" where he quite literally didn't do the research. His "dissertation" is online <a class="urllink" href="http://rationalia.com/gawdzilla/kent-hovind-doctoral-dissertation.pdf">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The first sentence is "Hello, my name is Kent Hovind," so it's obviously not written in formal academic style. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">He plagiarizes</a> <em>himself</em> at one point.
</li><li> This is a common deception of creationist evangelists; "Dr." Carl Baugh's purely honorary doctorates are actually either from places not accredited to give such doctorates or from "branches" of legitimate colleges that don't actually exist. At least one of his doctorates was from a "school" <em>he himself founded</em>...
</li><li> The controversial restaurant <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Attack_Grill">the Heart Attack Grill<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Las Vegas is owned by someone who calls himself Dr. Jon Basso in advertisements. He's not a real doctor, and it is doubtful that a real doctor would advise eating at the place, which serves some of the unhealthiest junk food in the country. At least two customers who ate there have had real heart attacks (one actually in the restaurant) and two spokesmen died of pneumonia.
</li><li> Dr Pepper and its knockoffs (of course). Supposedly the name was chosen for marketing purposes, as the drink was originally marketed as a health tonic.
</li><li> Sir Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, DFA. Doctorate of Fine Arts, an honorary degree or one given to a graduate student of the highest caliber. It means he has made a contribution to the field, and human knowledge. He jokingly uses it in his medical segments, to accentuate his character's status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a>.
</li><li> Dr. Karl Sven Woytek Sas Konkovitch Matthew Kruszelnicki (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeCallMeTim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeCallMeTim">usually called Dr. Karl</a>), Ig Nobel Laureate and science guy, has not done a PhD. He has a lot of degrees, but he's "Dr." because of a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery.
</li><li> Dr. Hunter S. Thompson received an honorary doctorate from the Universal Life Church in the late sixties and eventually started insisting on people acknowledging him as such. The ULC issues doctorates in divinity, but Thompson's character/alter-ego Raoul Duke liked calling himself a "doctor of journalism".
</li><li> Several <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/health/policy/02docs.html">nurses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> have doctorates in nursing, which entitles them to be called "doctor." This causes some friction with physicians.
</li><li> Dr. Lewis Yablonski is a sociologist who in 1967 visited several hippie communes and residences to gather information for a book (later titled <em>The Hippie Trip</em>). When he went to Morningstar in Northern California, he said, "I'm Dr. Yablonski, they're expecting me" and the man who greeted him immediately turned around and called out "The doctor's here! Is anyone sick?"
</li><li> According to AP style, the Dr. honorific is only supposed to be used for actual medical doctors, dentists and veterinarians. It is also used for paramedical professions and, for some bizarre reason, members of the clergy with earned or honorary doctorates. Ironically, AP style specifically does not use it in the majority of situations where someone actually earns a doctorate.
</li><li> DD, or Doctor of Divinity, is an accepted higher degree in theology and religious studies and is carried with pride by ministers and priests of all Christian denominations. The convention in Britain is that the two titles are used together to prevent misunderstanding - ie, conflated as Reverend Doctor. There is a case of a medical doctor who after some years followed a vocation to become a priest, eventually adding the suffix DD to his MD. He became a very rare Reverend Doctor Doctor....
<ul><li> The Universal Life Church will issue a DD to anyone with the required cash (around 20-30 dollars at time of writing). You can also get a doctorate in metaphysics. A lot of people have benefited from this in order to officiate weddings.
</li><li> Notorious Irish Presbyterian minister and politican, the Reverend Doctor Ian Kyle Paisley M.P., got his doctorate from a degree mill in the Bible Belt of the USA, and as people have pointed out, is not eligible to use the title "Doctor" as it came from an unrecognised institution. This makes him the Gillian McKeith of religion and politics.
</li></ul></li><li> Derek Smart, the man behind <em>Battlecruiser 3000AD</em> and <em>Universal Combat</em> claims to possess a doctorate and frequently titles himself as Ph.D. However, his thesis is not listed anywhere and he has refused to divulge basic details about his doctorate, such as which college he attended or who was his supervisor. There's understandable suspicion that he's lying.
</li><li> Former porn star Sharon Mitchell used her savings from nearly thirty years in the business to put herself through college and get a doctorate. Laudably, she had recognized that people working in the porn industry are at higher risk of contracting diseases, and that one performer with an STD who carries on working and doesn't declare it can infect a MASSIVE number of people.She also knew that younger porn performers are likely to be very ignorant of the risks and implications of the business, and that their employers can profit by keeping them ignorant. So she set up the Sharon Mitchell Foundation as a means of bringing practical advice, sexual education and practical, affordable (or free) medical treatment for people working in the sex industry. All very laudable, and a lot of people were impressed enough by Doctor Mitchell's personal achievement to donate generously to the charitable foundation. But... everyone meeting an engaging, personable and likable woman with a lot of drive and energy to do good, simply <em>assumed</em> she'd trained as a medical doctor at an accredited college. Sharon never contradicted this impression.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8125v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8125v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8125v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lots of publicity pictures and videos concerning the foundation she established show Sharon looking very professional - in a doctor's white lab coat. This didn't help either.</span> A lot of disillusionment set in when it was discovered her doctorate was in social services and it was from a college which, while not exactly a degree mill, wasn't all that prestigious either. The Sharon Mitchell Foundation, the AIMHCF, is now bankrupt<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9j9ld');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9j9ld" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9j9ld');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">After a lawsuit concerning the security breach in which its confidential files were stolen and placed online</span>, and Sharon herself returned to the business as a "mature performer".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RachelMaddow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RachelMaddow">Rachel Maddow</a> has a Doctorate in Political Science from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Oxbridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Oxbridge">Oxford University</a> (she was a Rhodes Scholar, in fact). Interestingly, she only occasionally mentions this, despite hosting a show dedicated to the subject in which she has her doctorate! This means that all those articles calling her "Ms Maddow" should in fact be calling her "<em>Dr</em> Maddow"...
</li><li> Chef Erin Burke, one of the founders of the Floribbean Cuisine movement in the 1970s, has two PhDs to her name: one in history, the other in biology, and indeed she worked as a college professor for a time. She also has a Bachelor's Degree in Culinary Arts, and these days prefers to be called "Chef" rather than "Doctor".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a> had a Doctorate in Education from University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He is listed as William Cosby, Ed. D. in the end credits to several of his shows, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em>. He also had Honorary Doctorates from over a dozen universities, most of them in Humane Letters, but he never uses a title. The "had" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">is because almost all of them have now been rescinded</a> following a large number of accusations (and later convictions) of sexual assault.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile">Jimmy Savile</a> had two doctorates; an honorary doctorate, and a doctorate of law. He did not have a formal doctorate, but was allowed to do volunteer work at hospitals, and even had wings named after him. Both of his doctorates were posthumously stripped from him over a year after his death after certain allegations against him came to light.
