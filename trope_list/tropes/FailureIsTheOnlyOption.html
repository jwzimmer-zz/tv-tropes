Thus, if they ever <em>do</em> get their hands on a windfall they have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyComeEasyGo">quickly lose it</a>.

This is usually done by making the hero extremely weak at that point in time, or making the boss unbeatable due to superior level or some outside force, especially if it's still early in the game. Mind you, it is almost guaranteed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">somebody somewhere will come up with a hack or unorthodox strategy to get around this</a>, resulting in either a complete failure of the plot to acknowledge the players victory, crashing the game, or some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>.

In fact, <em>all</em> the initial conditions of the main work are unavoidable, including but not limited to the presence of the villain. Consider for example the first <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, and the prequel trilogy. It is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> that Anakin would live on, that he would fall to the dark side, but also that most Jedi would be killed, that the Republic would turn into the Empire, etc. Any attempt of the heroes in the prequel to change this is doomed to failure.
</p><p>In cases of game shows with recurring contestants who keep bumbling their chances at winning a game, they are usually defined by the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky">Born Unlucky</a> (and if it gets <em>really</em> out of hand, they might be branded a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticLoser">Memetic Loser</a>), but once the streak of bad luck is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> and starts to become an in-joke regarding when or if the contestant figures out how to finally win and is expected to lose (or they themselves expect to lose), it transitions into this.

Trix used to have the Trix Vote every presidential Election year. Trix Rabbit won in 1972, 1980, and 1996. The election wasn't run again since 1996. One commercial was outright cruel about it, as the Rabbit DID get a bowl of Trix at one point, but as he goes to pour the milk, the carton was empty, prompting "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GotMilk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GotMilk">Got Milk?</a>"

Not counting the many times they submitted one-shots or names that got rejected even before they could be considered for serialization, their first manga, Detective Trap, gets canceled and their second manga, Tanto, ends after they decide that they're unable to make it popular enough, and that it would likely be canceled before it got an anime.

But on top of that the dragon the balls summoned, Porunga, only responds to wishes spoken in Namekian, something Frieza learned the hard way when he tried and failed to wish for immortality from Porunga, just for his wish to be ignored.

Even though they're playing a card game, of which the consequence of losing would normally only be a hit to the loser's ego (if that), <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> animes tend to have the heroes facing challenges where losing = death for various reasons (be they shadow duels or other), meaning that it's essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> that the heroes will win before they ever start their duel and failure is the only option for the villains.

He promptly spent his second issue of his legendary run on the series revealing that Swamp Thing was a plant elemental creature with Alex Holland's personality/memories and sealed the deal by producing the remains of Holland, having Swamp Thing meet Alex in heaven and having Swamp Thing pretty much not care about his life being a lie after a brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>. <br/><br/>This is ironic, given that in spite of the popularity of Moore's run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a></em> and his retcon, DC pretty much refuses to market Moore's version of the character in other media.

The President and his war cabinet overcome repeated crises in order to prevent the attack from going ahead, and are almost successful, but it is all for naught. A combination of systemic and personal failures on both sides leads to the end of the world.

</li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em>, when SD6 is, surprisingly, defeated in the middle of the second season. They are, of course, replaced by a new series of goals, some of which are also resolved before the end of the series.
<ul><li> Played straight with Sloane himself, though. At least as straight as it can be when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">HeelFace Revolving Door</a> is involved.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllThat">All That</a></em> had a running sketch of a gameshow, literally called "You Can't Win". Questions asked (if they're not skipped over entirely — because who cares, they'll never get it right anyway) include such examples as "Who am I thinking of right now?" or simply "How many shoes?" The one time a contestant actually got a question right, the host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">claimed he couldn't hear him</a> so it didn't count. There are also physical challenges, such as teaching a basset hound Spanish within ten seconds, or eating <em>exactly</em> 400 meatballs in 30 seconds (the contestant lost by eating the full amount given — 40<em>4</em> meatballs).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> has this theme in a more upbeat fashion. While Angel &amp; Co. try to fight the Senior Partners (and evil in general), they come to realize throughout the series that they can never defeat their adversaries. However, the point is not whether they will win against evil, but that they will fight the good fight regardless, issuing quotes like "We're not running a race, we're doing a job" and "If nothing we do matters, then the only thing that matters is what we do". In the Series Finale, they engage in a mostly suicidal mission that won't defeat Wolfram &amp; Hart, but will hopefully set them back a few decades.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> embodies this trope from the very first scene in the pilot to the last scene of the finale. It ends with the two characters who moved in with the family in the pilot to help them out basically saying,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">Screw This, I'm Outta Here!</a>" and running away to Mexico</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> crosses this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> in the flashback scenes. Oliver can never actually succeed in getting home to his family (at least, not until five years after he's shipwrecked on the island). However, it's also revealed that not all the 5 years was on the island; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and he <em>did</em> spend some time in his home city in year 3, he just couldn't tell anyone or let them see him</span>.
</li><li> A twist on this trope is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em>, wherein one of the goals: to evade capture by government forces, was met continuously until the show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> after four seasons with the fifth, in which they are captured and subsequently work for a covert federal agency headed by Robert Vaughn. (However, the underlying goal, clearing their name or at least getting a pardon, was never achieved.)

Then the means of finding the cure would lead to more story arcs involving corruption of the Earth government and the manipulation of leftover Shadow technology that were what J. Michael Straczynski really wanted the show to be about; the plague story had been forced on him by executives who wanted the show's core premise to be able to be summed up in a few words. Unfortunately, it was cancelled long before this could happen.

To do so, you must come up with a fool-proof scheme to rob the bank, conduct black market sales or otherwise embezzle money from various businesses or sources and then somehow make it so that the Duke boys were engaged in the illegal activity. But when you're Boss Hogg, and overambitious in seemingly wild schemes to destroy your rival — who, by the way, forced you out of illegal moonshine production by reporting the activities to the government (if only to avoid felony charges yourself) — and have a bumbling stooge of a brother-in-law who seemingly got his law enforcement training off the back of a kiddie's cereal box and seemingly could not understand the simplest of instructions to save his life, viewers would soon come to know what happens next ... but it was sure fun watching Boss and Rosco play the part of Wile E.

For Ted this would require him to replace the money that was "just resting in [his] account".
<ul><li> Goal achieved by subversion in "The Passion of St. Tibulas" then inverted in order to maintain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">status quo</a>. Charged with a task from Bishop Brennon, not only does Ted fail in the task he achieves the opposite effect. Thus the Bishop having had enough of them sends them to even worse parishes, where they won't be his problem. Inverted when they successfully blackmail the Bishop on his vows of celibacy.
</li><li> Also achieved in the first episode of the third season. Ted, possibly as a reward for his actions in the Christmas Special, is sent to a much nicer parish. But when his fellow priests notice some irregularities in the accounts, Ted is promptly sent back to Craggy Island ... where he discovers Mrs. Doyle bent almost double due to back trouble, Dougal's pet hamster riding around on a miniature bicycle, and Father Jack living in the chimney.
</li><li> The finale looks to be the eventual ending of this, with Ted being offered a place at a parish in Los Angeles by an American priest who was very impressed by Teds managing to talk a suicidal priest off a ledge. Subverted when he quits when the priest actually tells him it's a Parish in a gang warfare zone. Lampshaded by Dougal, when he says Ted is stuck with them forever.

However, we find in the next episode that, for one reason or another, they are unable to capitalize on the gains. Arguably, in <em>Serenity</em>, it is the fact that the crew is actually able to pull off the heist at the beginning and <em>then</em> cash in on it in the next scene that makes all the forthcoming fighting-the-power action plausible. <br/><br/>This is actually a long-running minor trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>, as mentioned by Mal Reynolds at least once: "It never goes smooth.

They did finally get rescued years later in a reunion movie, but in the <em>second</em> movie (when they met up again for a reunion trip in the first one after they were rescued, they got washed up right back on the same island; they were rescued for good in the second one) it turned out they hated life on the mainland so much that they <em>returned</em>.

<ul><li> During the first season, the guys frequently lament that they are in danger of going into foreclosure on their houses back home. Failure to find any gold means going home not just broke, but deeper in debt than when they started. Unfortunately, by the end of season one, they have failed to find more than a few ounces of gold valued in the tens of thousands of dollars. They need more than 100 ounces worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</li><li> Season 2 saw the Hoffman crew kicked off their Porcupine Creek claim as well as recovering a relatively small amount of gold.
</li><li> Season 4 saw the Hoffman crew pretty much lose everything in the jungles of Guyana.
</li><li> Parker's first few seasons mining from his grandfather's Big Nugget mine were nothing but disappointment.
</li><li> Although they finally meet their 1000 and 2000 ounce goals by the end of season 5, after the "final" cleanouts, we learn that they need more gold to secure mining rights for the next season (Hoffman crew) or afford to buy a new claim (Parker Schnabel).
</li><li> For season 6, Tony Beets wanted to produce 900 ounces or 1 million dollars worth of gold with his decades-old resurrected dredge. He missed that goal by about 100 ounces. But his high efficiency methods gave him a 50 to 60% return on the digging efforts. (Vs 10 to 30% for stationary washplants.) Operating the dredge taught him and the crew how to do the job correctly and Tony plans on buying a second dredge during the 2016 mining season (season 7).
</li><li> Eight episodes into season 7 and Tony Beets's dredge has been sunk not just once, but twice.
<ul><li> The next episode, the inspector declares his top-heavy tugboat unseaworthy, requiring him to go out and find another means of pushing/towing/hauling his new dredge downriver.

So, the trope was played usually by having one obvious prediction and two laughable to think that they'd come true, thus always failing. One week, a laughable prediction was "A member of Boyzone will come out as being homosexual." Shock — horror, within a week a member of Boyzone came out!

Most of their schemes fail for one reason or another, and the Boys quickly blow through the money they make for the schemes that actually succeed. This is subverted by the end of the seventh season, where the Boys make over $450,000 in a scheme that involves shipping marijuana to the United States and getting contraband cigarettes in exchange, which they sell at cut-rate prices in Canada.
<ul><li> Which they end up losing later, proving that this trope always takes precedence in this show. If that wasn't bad enough, virtually <em>everyone</em> ends up going to jail due to a well-crafted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">plan</a> by Mr. Lahey.

Just when they had completed their ultimate weapon to defeat all of them, it's revealed that the death of an Original means the death of every Vampire connected to that Original's Sire line. The cast lose the war once they learn this, because far too many of their friends (and the series 3 leads) are Vampires and the show would have to do some serious recasting and concept altering if they wanted to have a Season 4.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> is a perfect example of this. In a show with cops, drug dealers, politicians, union workers, and school students barely anyone really wins in the end. "The game is rigged, but you cannot lose if you do not play." Practically every major character on the show experiences this:
<ul><li> Detective McNulty's goal is to stop Marlo Stanfield by fabricating a series of murders to "juke the stats" and divert police resources to the Major Crimes Unit. While he does arrest Marlo and his crew, the victory is hollow: the fabricated murders are discovered, leading McNulty, Rhonda Pearlman and Commissioner Daniels to all fall on their swords. Marlo ends up getting off scot-free (with caveats), the reporter who covered the fake serial killer story (whom the Detective chewed out) wins a Pulitzer Prize for his stories, and McNulty realizes in the end that he can't change the system.
</li><li> The kids introduced in the fourth season (and, by extension, the entire Baltimore school system). Roland Prezbylewski realizes that nothing he does can curb the school system's trend of cutting corners and mismanaging internal resources, even though he tries to give the kids a better education. Most of the main students end up becoming "hard" to the Baltimore street life and take up the roles of past main characters (Dukie becomes a drug user like Bubbles, Michael becomes a stick-up artist like Omar, and Randy becomes a thug in a group home).

Their ratings do improve, but hardly to the degree that the lead character, program manager Andy Travis, is trying to reach.

The only rules given for Cthulhu itself is that it consumes 1d6 investigators per round.

<ul><li> <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> is practically Failure Is The Only Option: The Game. Your characters <em>will</em> go insane.

</li></ul></li><li> In the official <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> worldwide campaigns, the bad guys (okay, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">worse</a></em> guys) will lose. No matter what. Honestly, you might not even bother. It's like the creators have already thought up an ending in advance! True, they always lose. But as it is said in the Horus Heresy books they are destined to win. Well, Chaos at least. It is said that they will whittle away at the Imperium until eventually all of humanity is destroyed. Considering most every daemon or Chaos Space Marine can't die, this is easily understood.
<ul><li> In a particularly silly example, the <em>Storm of Chaos</em> Fantasy campaign: One small backwater village, intended merely as a speedbump for the bad guys, was held for somewhat like five weeks, finally forcing the Chaos players to find a way around it. In the fluff summary after the campaign, the village got merely a passing mention - as being easily overrun. The guys who'd spent the past weeks successfully defending it were somewhat annoyed, to say the least.
</li><li> Abbadon the Despoiler in background, Justified in that the only way out of the Eye of Terror is to attack a heavily fortified sector of space that has entire planets populated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normals</a> plus with twenty Space Marine chapters on hand. (Note this is all before the Imperium starts to send reinforcements), then throw in the fact that Chaos is inherently self-destructive and it's no wonder Chaos always peeters out and fails in every Black Crusade... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Even when he <em>does</em> win the Cadian Gate in <em>Gathering Storm</em>, Necron and Eldar interference means the Warp rift he hoped would consume Terra went way off target, Chaos being Chaos meant his army fragmented soon after the battle, and Guilliman's revival meant the Imperium was far better prepared and armed for when he prepared for Round 2.</span>
</li><li> Played quite blatantly with the Medusa V campaign. The Space Marines did, in fact, fail to achieve all their goals; leaving the Imperial Guard and Eldar roughly tied for first place, with the Eldar being the ones to kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Ygethmor. Since the Space Marines are Games Workshop's major cash cow, allowing a Xeno race the victory simply would not stand; so they were declared to have achieved enough of their goals in both the planetary and space campaign to be granted the "moral victory"; thus keeping the Imperium in the first two slots, and pushing the Eldar to third.
</li><li> Though in a larger context, even the forces of Chaos are doomed to failure, because the stalemate of eternal war has to be maintained to keep the game marketable. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed">The World Is Always Doomed</a> can't be maintained if the world actually meets a definitive doom.
</li><li> Tzeentch actually invokes the trope on himself and his forces. If his forces were ever to definitively win, then he would have no one to plot against, which would range from being boring for him to him literally wiping himself from existence. So, if his forces ever started to win, he would be just as likely to be the source of their downfall as his enemies.
<ul><li> He is the only Chaos god this truly applies to. Khorne doesn't care who is dying, just as long as someone is. Slannesh and Nurgle just don't really require an antagonist for their worship.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite the issues with Games Workshop having to maintain a stalemate at least for the Imperium, if you focus on the setting itself, pieces of fluff from the Codexes and all the supplementary material, you realize this might as well be the motto of the Imperial Forces. They are faced with half a dozen threats which could single-handedly destroy them. In fact the only reason for the Imperium still existing is the fact said threats are fighting each other. If the creators of the game weren't forced to keep the cash flowing in by keeping the Spaces Marines as the victors, humans would be dead already.
</li><li> The Orks actually invert this trope with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a>. Being a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knights</a>, they believe there are only three outcomes to a fight: they win, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">die fighting</a>, or they retreat (which isn't failure because they can just come back for another go).
</li><li> In truth, it's more <em>anyone who attempts to change the Status Quo</em> who loses. But since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact">Villains Act, Heroes React</a>, most of the time the evillest side loses.

<ul><li> One of the best examples of this comes from a metagame strategy known as the "Star of India", a formation that you play with as Asia when fighting 1v1 against Russia.

However, you are still limited to the same basic story-<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for example, no matter how badly you want to play the part of cold-blooded assassin working for the hideously corrupt UNATCO, you are forced by your brother to go to a captured NSF base and send a distress signal. This action immediately causes you to be considered a rogue by UNATCO and all the agents will become hostile. It's required to advance the storyline and cannot be avoided</span>.
<ul><li> This isn't how the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">was supposed to be, actually,</a> as we can see <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEg5Xo7VFU">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> At that point, the game was supposed to split into two branching storylines, one following the NSF and another for UNATCO.

<ul><li> Act 1: The hero arrives too late to catch Diablo in his new body and Andariel is successful in delaying his venture to the east to go after Diablo.
</li><li> Act 2: The hero arrives in what couldn't have been more than a few minutes after Diablo got there and freed his brother, which is precisely what you were trying to stop him from doing. They leave Duriel there to delay the character's pursuit.
</li><li> Act 3: You make it to Mephisto mere moments after he activates the power of the soulstones on his brother Diablo and opens a portal to hell for them to escape to, staying behind himself to delay the player's pursuit.
</li><li> Act 4: You actually make it to Diablo and kill him before he does anything too terrible, but that's only because he wasn't actually trying to do anything to Sanctuary at that point, and Baal was still at large in Sanctuary (although fortunately, he didn't manage to find Marius or retrieve his Soulstone until some time after Diablo's defeat, so you don't exactly fail). However, while you do manage to catch up to what the Prime Evils are planning, you squander that lead in the months leading up to...
</li><li> Act 5: Halfway through, you arrive just too late to interrupt Baal from getting an object that will allow him to walk right through the front door of the Worldstone Keep. You then get to Baal and - surprise, surprise - he doesn't seem to have corrupted the Worldstone yet. You fight him and defeat him thinking that you arrived just in time to stop the world from being destroyed, but wait! Tyrael then tells you that the mere act of Baal touching the Worldstone corrupted it completely, meaning that after the fight you find out that yet again you arrived too late, once again by mere minutes at the very most.
</li><li> The entire quest you set out on in the beginning of the game turns into failure after failure. Sure, you destroy 5 of the most powerful evil beings in existence, but not before they succeed in doing the very thing that they set out to do in the first place. And let's not forget Diablo is using the body of the Warrior from the first game.

Almost like he was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a> by default simply for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffoonishTomCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffoonishTomCat">a cat in an old cartoon.</a>
</li><li> In the case of eating Tweety, when Sylvester finally did that in the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSylvesterAndTweetyMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSylvesterAndTweetyMysteries">The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries</a></em>, it resulted in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the show being cancelled</span>.
</li><li> There have also been occasions where Sylvester DID eat Tweety, but he was then forced to spit him out.
</li><li> And delightfully inverted and subverted in "Tiny Toons: How I Spent My Summer Vacation." Beep beep! SPLAT!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElmerFudd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElmerFudd">Elmer Fudd</a> did manage to kill Bugs in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsOperaDoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsOperaDoc">What's Opera, Doc?</a>" using his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Maaagiiicc Helllmeettt</a>'s" weather control powers. But as he was carrying off Bugs's body Bugs looked back at the audience and said "What did you expect in an opera, a happy ending?"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhereOnEarthIsCarmenSandiego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhereOnEarthIsCarmenSandiego">Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?</a></em> Obviously, if they catch her, she has to escape. Depressingly lampshaded in one episode, when Zack moans to Ivy that they never seem to catch her. Another time they <em>let</em> her escape because Carmen's wanna-be replacement <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sara Bellum</span> was even worse. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4tkeg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4tkeg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4tkeg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And Zack felt they owed Carmen a favor since it was only with all three of them working together they escaped Bellum's trap/prison.</span></span>
<ul><li> Played with when reversed around with the Nightmare Stone. In both situations the heroes succeeded in capturing it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatThemAtTheirOwnGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatThemAtTheirOwnGame">rather handily</a>, however <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">they could never truly dispose of it</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wunschpunsch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wunschpunsch">Wunschpunsch</a></em>: The spells of the week Bubonic and Tyrannia cast never last long enough to become permanent.
</li><li> In-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>: in "Depths" Black Manta admits to Kaldur that he would have continued setting up missions with a high chance of failure on Kaldur's part until he did fail, since he wanted to see if Kaldur would take credit for something he didn't actually accomplish. As Black Manta said, "true character is revealed not by success, but by failure."
</li><li> As for actual exceptions in animation: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ConanTheAdventurer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ConanTheAdventurer">Conan the Adventurer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jumanji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jumanji">Jumanji</a></em>. Conan eventually did defeat his arch-enemy and save his family while the final episode of Jumanji had the trio find the final clue and escape the game for good.
