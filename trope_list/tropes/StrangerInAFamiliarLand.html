His mother is dismayed by how much the war has changed her little boy, and they part less than amicably.

Kagome has three friends from her school, and we see how she has less and less in common with them the once or twice per season she returns home; they're thinking of tests and cute boys, while her circumstances have her outgrowing normal high-school concerns. When she talks about her romantic troubles but leaves out the details, they think he's just hung up on his ex, while the truth is more like "his dead previous fiancee <em>isn't</em> dead, and we don't know which side she's on or what her complicated long-term game is, as if an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>-wielder who only gets more unkillable every week wasn't <em>enough.</em>"

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, Reiner Braun states that his driving motivation is to return to his hometown.

To this end, he has to parrot the government's propaganda, smile while his family grooms his cousin to follow in his footsteps for their own benefit, and pretend to hate the people he once considered his dearest friends. While he clearly doesn't fit in anymore, leaving isn't an option either because his superiors will kill him and punish his entire family</span>.

He clearly goes insane in his certainty he will be too late, and fails to recognize his own family on return. One of the actors in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> compared the superheroes' situation to 'War veterans trying to fit in with society'.
</li><li> Samaritan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em> is a particularly extreme example - he was born in a desolate future where humanity was about to die out, and was sent back in time to our era to change history. He eventually ended up in a fight with a villain who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticBackgroundReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticBackgroundReference">we assume</a> had some sort of time-related powers, which got him sent back to his own time. He discovered that he'd succeeded in his mission and that the future was now one where humanity was thriving, but the changes he'd made were so extensive that he'd become a temporal anomaly — the rest of his family were never born, and what was his home had become a taco stand.
<ul><li> In a later story that tells of Samaritan's archenemy Infidel, the immortal Infidel traveled forward in time and built an empire in Samaritan's old world, only to be shocked and appalled at the ignominy when he finds that <em>his</em> home (which had been coincidentally built on the wreckage of Samaritan's) had <em>also</em> become the <em>same</em> taco stand.

Having spent most of his life in the United States, South Africa, Australia, and Canada, Scrooge has problems being accepted by traditional Scottish villagers. Soon Scrooge decides to return to the United States, this time taking his two sisters with him.

Ginger is upset that raunchy movies have replaced the glamorous ones from her time, the Professor's inventions have been created in his absence (and he's being pressured to spend all his time raising funds for the university), the Howells have moved beyond their wealthy society friends and Mary Ann has outgrown her fiance.

This is partly why he leaves with Moya again, the other part being that Earth is in danger if he's there (and even when he's not, it turns out).

He talks about all the things he had planned to do with her had circumstances allowed him to raise her there as he had originally planned before they were separated while she was in infancy. Then it comes out that the last time he had spent more than a few days at a stretch in his home town was before he met Skye's mother (and Skye is <em>twenty-six</em>). The first disconnect was when he realized that his favorite bakery was now a currency exchange.

Philip recognizes that the decades he spent in America not only changed him but also changed his home country. If he ever goes back, he will not fit in and might not like the country the Soviet Union has become. Elizabeth is more of a zealot and refuses to consider this, holding on to an idealized vision of the Soviet Union that never really existed.

Your character may become enthralled by the pursuit of occult knowledge, or fearful that these creatures will devour humanity if they are not hunted down and chased out of the universe. If you choose to stay after your quest is done, Gehrman decides to mercy-kill you because only a madman would willingly continue to murder and be murdered by an endless slew of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> while they are subjected to daily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrange">Life Is Strange</a></em>, Max feels this way after returning to her home town to attend a finishing school 5 years after moving away. Not only doesn't she know anyone too well (mainly staying in her room, and barely getting to know her dorm-mates), but she's too afraid to contact her former best friend Chloe (because of the guilt of failing to stay in contact after the death of her dad, who Max was also close to). As much of the game is spent showing her rediscovering the town and reconnecting with Chloe (now a rebellious, blue haired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">lad-ette</a> stoner, although just as energetic as she remembers) as investigating the supernatural happenings.

When he comes back, a lot of things have changed, including his friends loving a clown show they all hated before he left. However, this is downplayed, as he's readjusted by the next episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> has this as the theme of the series finale ("Things Change").

<ul><li> Explorer Marco Polo experienced this. He left home at 17 to explore Asia with his father and uncle and didn't return for almost 25 years. He barely spoke his own language anymore and of the family that was still alive, most of them thought he was already dead or didn't recognize him.
</li><li> Returning military veterans (not just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">combat vets</a>) often feel this way when they separate from active duty. It's not a coincidence so many of the Literature examples above were by veterans. One WWI song fits the emotion: "How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down On The Farm? (After They've Seen Paree?)"
</li><li> Prison inmates, especially those that were in long enough that modern technology has changed the landscape since they went in (automobiles, computers, etc).This also applies to those who've lived in mental hospitals for much of their lives.

</li><li> People who emigrate to another country will get this feeling after returning to their original country after many years. The language and customs have changed enough that you have a hard time communicating even if you are still a fluent speaker.
</li><li> Step 1: Go to college. Step 2: Graduate, drop out, or transfer. Step 3: Wait two/three years. Step 4: Come back and watch as you recognize barely <em>anyone</em>. This was one of the reasons for the decline (and eventual abandonment) of many of Newfoundland's tiny outport villages: kids went away to school in larger communities, and after working and living there for a while had no interest in returning to an isolated existence.
</li><li> Some colleges put together pamphlets and other resources to help exchange students cope with "reverse culture shock" or "reverse homesickness." When a student spends a semester abroad, it's often enough for them to put down a certain amount of roots, so when they come back home, they miss it.
