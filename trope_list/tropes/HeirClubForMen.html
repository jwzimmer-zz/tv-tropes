</p><p>This trope takes two main forms:
</p><ul><li> <strong>Agnatic Succession</strong>: When there is no male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">heir</a> <em>there is no heir</em>.
</li><li> <strong>Agnatic-Cognatic Succession</strong>: Women may inherit, but only if there is no suitable male heir.
</li></ul><p>The distinction is less clear than you might think. It's rarely the case that there are <em>no</em> male claimants, however, so if there's no <em>clear</em> heir (the king has no sons, but does have uncles, brothers, nephews, or male cousins) then a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> often results. The threat of such a crisis is reason enough for kings of countries with these laws to go to great lengths to ensure that they have at least one son on the ground who is both legitimate and his official heir.
</p><p>If the king has no son or circumstances seem to be making that problematic, the courtiers may get into the act. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> can be unpleasant all around. This is done commonly with a grieving widow queen or widower king, who is likely to be told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveWaitedLongEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveWaitedLongEnough">You Have Waited Long Enough</a> with great promptness.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Even in the fortunate case where the king has a healthy male heir, this only secures the monarchy for one generation. As soon as that son comes of age, he will start feeling pressure to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids">marry and produce an heir of his own</a>. Furthermore, only one child is dangerous; surely you need <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">at least two</a> to guard against tragedy (although this drastically increases chances of producing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince">The Evil Prince</a>, which comes with its own set of problems). This is one of the few situations where either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking">My Biological Clock Is Ticking</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantGrandkids">I Want Grandkids</a> is likely to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope">apply to a male character</a>.
</p><p>Additionally, it's a good idea to guard against fraud. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe">Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe</a> may raise doubts about whether the baby is suitable. Some monarchs will avoid putting all their eggs in one basket and make the spare a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince">Hidden Backup Prince</a>. (Bastards of the king are popular for fulfilling both these tropes, although as making them heirs defeats the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarDiplomacy">Altar Diplomacy</a>, they are best avoided.)
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Although most common in stories about royalty, this trope also includes the common people. This trope is about heirs, and it is not intended to cover cases where the parent(s) merely wish for a boy (or girl) because they would like one, but is only when they wish for one to continue the family name â€” when tradition demands it.
</p><p>Also: The blurb is a reference to the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_Club">Hair Club for Men<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a company that specializes in hair restoration and hair replacement. The blurb is their actual sales pitch from their website... with a few words changed to fit this trope.
</p><p>Of course, in the case of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy">Matriarchy</a>, this trope is automatically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope">gender-inverted</a>. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalMess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalMess">Royal Mess</a> for the ways in which this can get interesting.

</li><li> The plot driver of <em>Ribbon No Kishi</em>, aka <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessKnight">Princess Knight</a></em>, which provided direct inspiration for other mangas like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles">Rose of Versailles</a></em>. A male heir must inherit the throne, Sapphire is born with a conspicuous lack of penis, her father the king decides to bluff the public and Sapphire becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Sweet Polly Oliver</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>: Rishid in the original was adopted by the Ishtars to provide a male heir. Then Ishizu and Marik were born in turn, and Marik the son was chosen as the official heir. A particularly potent example: Rishid/Odion desires the position of Tombkeeper more than anything, whilst Marik wants nothing more than to be rid of it.
<ul><li> Though notably Rishid/Odion wants the position BECAUSE Marik wants nothing to do with it. And for the sake of geniunely wanting to fulfill the family duty rather than for the power of the position. Mostly out of loyalty because Marik truely does love him as a brother and he wants to relieve him of the unwanted burden, and on a lesser note out of practicality to the family that took him in as it would obviously make more sense for the critical family position to be filled by someone that actively wants the job.
</li></ul></li><li> Needing a male heir, in particular, a biological one, is the source of much of the trouble related to adopted child Amon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>. Like Rishid, Amon was adopted by the Garams to be their heir after he was abandoned by his biological family and felt he had nothing to live for. Then the Garams have a young son, Shido, who becomes the heir and Amon is expected to essentially do everything in his power to support Shido.
</li><li> Miroku of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> needs to perpetuate his line (with a son) before the affliction that plagues all men in his family kills him. He attempts to do so by propositioning <strong>every</strong> girl he meets. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He loses the affliction before the end of the story but has at least three kids anyway with Sango, and one's a boy</span>.
</li><li> In the fictional Kingdom of Sauville in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick">Gosick</a></em>, the Queen Coco Rose was deposed of by King Rupert because of her inability to bear a child. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Which later turns out to be a ruse: It was King Rupert who was sterile. To add insult to injury, Coco Rose became pregnant... with Leviathan the Alchemist's child.</span>
</li><li> Thought to happen in Syaoran's family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>, as he is considered the head of his family (despite having four older sisters) since his father passed away. This status is limited in Syaoran's case, however, given his young age. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">It puts a lot of pressure on him.</a>
</li><li> The aversion of this trope forms the basis of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAmbitionOfOdaNobuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAmbitionOfOdaNobuna">The Ambition of Oda Nobuna</a></em>; its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki">Sengoku period</a> practices equal primogeniture which justified its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">gender flipping</a> some historical figures but not others.
</li><li> This is why Ryuunosuke Fujinami was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedAsTheOppositeGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedAsTheOppositeGender">Raised as the Opposite Gender</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em>; her father was obsessed with the idea that only a <em>boy</em> could be a worthy heir to his family legacy of... running a ratty little beachside store. This is used for roughly equal parts comedy and to paint Mr. Fujinami as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">creepy and insane</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MayoChiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MayoChiki">Mayo Chiki!</a></em>, Subaru's family has had a tradition of serving as butlers to the Suzutsuki family, but her mother died a few years after giving birth to her, and her father, the current butler, does not wish to remarry. The head of the Suzutsuki family is willing to allow Subaru to be the next butler in an exception to the rule that only males can do so, but under the condition that she keep her gender a secret for her high school years- the plot is kicked off by Jirou discovering her secret.

By the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">great-granddaughters' time</a>, the Shogunate and Japan at large were firmly of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">opposite school of thought</a>.
<ul><li> Interestingly, after they end up with two male shoguns in a row (Ienari and Ieyoshi), many expressed the wish to make it a heir club for women again, if only because women can't produce too many children, while Ienari and Ieyoshi each had dozens of children that drain the coffers and have to be found suitable mates.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles">Rose of Versailles</a></em>, general de Jarjayes, annoyed after his latest attempt at having a male heir to inherit his titles (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">necessary due French law</a>) failed, decided to raise his youngest daughter as a man. Differently from usual instances, everyone knows that Oscar is actually a woman, but she's so confident in men's clothing and so talented in her military role that French society basically treats her as an 'honorary' man for all intents and purposes.

When he became a widower, he set his eyes on the younger Elliot daughter Anne, who though not as handsome as her sister is very intelligent, gentle and nearly an angel. He appreciates her character, however, his strongest motive to remarry is to be closer to the family so that he can keep an eye on Sir Walter (also widowed) who might get married again soon and produce a son of his own after all, which would cut his inheritance of the baronetcy and the estate.

One of the major political issues is that the First Lord has no heir, since his son died in an attack on a remote area of Alera, so there is a lot of political maneuvering for the throne. About midway through the series, this comes to a head.

The Aillard line is matriarchal and matrilineal, and Renunciates are forbidden from playing the game; they must vow to never make a traditional royal marriage or become a concubine, and "to bear children only in [their] own time and season," not for their family's ambitions.

A much less amusing example in one of the flashback story arcs involved a king who had three daughters and no sons. When he died the fathers of his grandsons each declared that their firstborn son was the rightful king (And that the father of the 'rightful' king was naturally his regent until the king became of age).

Since Clan women are inherently incapable of leadership, each clan is led by a man who invariably passes the leadership on to another male. The new leader is traditionally the oldest son of the previous leader, though there are exceptions. For example, Creb is the oldest son of a leader, but, because he is crippled and therefore unable to truly become a man in the eyes of the Clan, he has instead become his clan's Mog-ur (shaman), while his younger brother, Brun, is the leader of the clan.

His father is either the king, in which case he's the heir, or another man, who the king killed in a fit of jealousy, which is why Tam's life is in danger, especially since in the latter case, he could be a pretender for the king's rivals to gather around.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoblinEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoblinEmperor">The Goblin Emperor</a></em>, this drives most of the plot. The elven emperor was very dutiful in begetting sons; he not only divorced one wife for barrenness, but he also produced a total of four sons with different wives. Only because those three sons and he himself died in an airship accident does his half-goblin son Maia inherit the throne. And is then promptly told by his advisors that he has to produce a male heir. Maia agrees that arranging a marriage for him is the wisest course of action, but does not manage to get really enthusiastic about it, and at one point invalidates his own claim to the throne by calling the barren ex-wife of his father "zhasanai", a title reserved for the emperor's <em>widow</em>. As he already has an underage nephew who could inherit the throne after him, producing a male heir is less about securing that there is an heir, and more about making sure that those who would like to see his nephew on the throne don't just have to murder <em>him</em> to get there.

Grayson has recently tweaked the law to allow women to inherit (with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">grandfather clause</a> for current heirs), especially making sense due to the population being 75% female.

One of the protagonists is Cardenia Wu-Patrick, the illegitimate daughter of the previous emperox. She was never supposed to rule, but then her half-brother got himself killed in a race, and her father named her as his new successor instead of any number of cousins and nephews. One of the other protagonists (the son of a nobleman) finds out that his father changed his order of succession and named his daughter the heir presumptive instead (this is just to allow his son to leave the planet without much scrutiny).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ladylord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ladylord">Ladylord</a></em>, trouble regarding a lack of male heirs makes an appearance twice in the story. The whole premise of the book is kicked off when a lord doesn't have any sons but declares his daughter to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing">his "son" and heir</a> anyway. In the other case, a lord has trouble acquiring an heir due to impotence, making the pregnancy of one particular concubine particularly valuable to him. This grants said concubine more leeway in court than she would otherwise have. After the child is born, she is part of a plot to have him kidnapped by the lord's enemies, in part because this preserves her necessity - she's the only woman ever to bear the lord a son, and he can't kill her if he thinks he needs to make another one. (In fact, the first child <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe">isn't even his</a>.)
</li><li> In Lynda Robinson's <em>Lord Meren</em> mysteries, Meren is perfectly happy having his <em>adopted</em> son Kysen as his legal heir.

While her husband Frederain is referred to as "Lord Frederain", he is, in fact, only a consort (he doesn't care, his main goal is to raise their son to be a good leader). Even among the brutish Hahn, it's pointed out that Lord Kamar Hahn's son Hennik isn't the heir presumptive, as he has an older sister. But given that his sister Shimlish is also the supreme commander of the Hahn military, it's possible that she could die in battle, leaving Hennik as the heir.

Lord Ulric of Ulmsdale had been unable to father any living children, so he divorced his second wife and married the widowed Lady Tephana because she was of proven fertility, having a son from a previous marriage. This led to a great deal of trouble starting at the end of the short story and picking up at the beginning of the novel when Lady Tephana utterly rejected her son by Ulric - Kerovan - and settled down to scheming on behalf of her first-marriage son and later her daughter by Ulric. (The latter could inherit if Kerovan died or was publicly rejected as being unqualified to rule, e.g. because of mental or physical infirmity).
</li><li> Joisan, the female lead of <em>The Crystal Gryphon</em> is involved in another potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>.

Although Joisan has been in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> since early childhood, Toross's mother keeps trying to throw her together with Toross in the hopes of securing the succession for him.

Then they realize that such a small kingdom can't afford a dozen royal dowries, so it is decided that as each daughter comes of age, she has to leave the kingdom and seek her fortune somewhere else (The books themselves follow the adventures of said daughters).

Maharet, one of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampires</a>, had a daughter before being turned. Since then, she has tracked all of her matrilineal descendants without regard for any descendants of males. While this made more sense in ancient times without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe">reliable (or any kind) paternity testing</a> (although she did assume that all women cheat), this is more of a tradition than anything in modern times.

<ul><li> The nobility of Arcasia adhere to the Agnatic-Cognatic Succession model: Persephone is a Countess who inherited her title due to a lack of living brothers.
</li><li> Inverted with the Telchines dynasties that preceded them, which were both matriarchies.
</li><li> Glycon, a nation populated by the descendants of the Telchines and ruled by a theocracy made up of priestesses, also inverts the trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Male heirs are the norm in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em>, with the Princedom of Corisande being of particular note, as Prince Hektor regards his heir as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor">Inadequate Inheritor</a>, and would gladly make his daughter Irys the heir of Corisandian law allowed it. There are exceptions though, primarily with Sharleyan of Chisholm, who inherited and kept the Crown despite the shadow of a less competent queen hanging over her. She later became the co-ruler and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a> to Cayleb of Charis, and nobody has any doubt that Cayleb and Sharleyan's daughter Alahnah will be their heir in the fullness of time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap">Septimus Heap</a></em> has only female Queens. Men can't become rulers, and there never were any Kings; even the idea is deemed ludicrous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>: The kingdom of NÃºmenor had a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture#Agnatic_primogeniture">Agnatic Primogeniture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> law applied to its line of Kings. Tar-Aldarion, having no male heirs and having only a daughter, changed the Law of Succession, replacing the principle of agnatic primogeniture with that of fully equal primogeniture and she (as Tar-AncalimÃ«) became the first Ruling Queen of NÃºmenor. Afterward, the oldest child inherited the throne whether they were male or female. <br/><br/>His legal changes were largely undone in practice, however, as only two other queens claimed the throne in the next 16 generations. The odds of this happening by pure chance are <em>extremely</em> low, assuming male and female royal offspring were equally likely to be born and survive to inherit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>:
<ul><li> The nobility of Westeros practice a form of male-preference cognatic primogeniture, meaning that lordly titles are passed down from father to eldest son. A younger son could inherit if his elder brother dies without any male issue<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2kcbr');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2kcbr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2kcbr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">or joins the Nights' Watch, the Maesters, or the Kingsguardâ€”all celibate orders that require the renunciation of titles held or expectant</span>, and a female heir could only inherit if she has no surviving brothers and none of her brothers had any male issue. Even then, families often cast a wide net to find a male heir among the cadet branches and other distant relations rather than allow a female to hold power in her own right. This is because should a female heir marry, her husband would take power of her inheritance through her, more or less starting a new house traced through his own line and cutting out the existing family entirely. This has implications when daughters of defeated noble houses are forced into marriage with the victors, that the victor's family might lay claim to the defeated family's holdings. This also gets the obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruction</a> that many suitable, even decent female candidates are passed over for giving power to men who are just vicious, insane and/or incompetent, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">entirely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">predictable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">results</a>.
</li><li> This is certainly the case later on in the books. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Robb Stark's death at the Red Wedding and the presumed death of his two younger brothers</span>, Sansa is the presumptive heir of the Stark family. Accordingly, as the spoils of war, Lord Tywin marries his son Tyrion to her; as the husband to the Stark's rightful heir, Tyrion could then rule the North in the name of House Lannister. Robb attempts to preemptively thwart this when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">disinherits Sansa in his will and names another heir, thought by most fans to be Jon Snow</span>, but if any of the witnesses to this are around, they're not in a position to press the issue.
</li><li> Unlike the rest of Westeros, Dorne exercises absolute cognatic primogeniture, wherein the eldest child of the ruler inherits, period. Like most legal snafus, this causes trouble when the Prince of Dorne's daughter schemes to make Myrcella Baratheon<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">/Lannister</span> the queen of the Seven Kingdoms, as by Dorne's laws she would be the rightful heir. Part of her scheming comes from a plot by Prince Doran that (mistakenly) makes her believe that he means to scam her out of her rights in favor of her younger brother.
</li><li> Subverted in the case of the Dothraki. Daenerys expects her unborn son to become the heir to Khal Drogo's khalasar simply by being his child after Drogo dies, but Jorah Mormont tells her that the Dothraki do not honor blood and will only follow the strongest. The khalasar is then splintered by new khals who take the remnants, while Daenerys is left with around 100, consisting of her bloodriders, handmaidens, old men, women, and children. And even then, it takes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the birth of her dragons</span> before they accept her as leader. Drogo himself is the son of a great khal, Bharbo, but did not inherit his father's armies. It is also noted that Drogo is a very young khal, leading an immense khalasar of his own before the age of 30.
</li><li> Also subverted in much the same way with the Wildlings, as Jon Snow has to constantly explain to Stannis and Melisandre: yes, Mance Rayder is King Beyond The Wall, but that isn't the same sort of thing as Westerosi royalty, and Mance's son is <em>not</em> a prince - "You don't become King Beyond The Wall because your father was."
</li><li> The laws can get confusing at times. After Lord Rickard Karstark is killed his one surviving son Harrion inherits but his uncle Arnolf tries to have his son Cregan marry Rickard's daughter Alys so that he can inherit after they get Harrion killed. Cregan can't inherit the title without marrying Alys and she realizes that so she runs away <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and marries a Wildling lord instead</span>.
</li><li> The Iron Islands ostensibly follow the same inheritance laws as the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, but when King Balon dies with all of his sons presumed dead, there is enough opposition to the idea of a woman (his daughter Asha) ruling in her own right that they revive the centuries-dead tradition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">Elective Monarchy</a> (in the form of a kingsmoot, which Asha attempts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">to turn into a queensmoot</a>) instead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The crown winds up going to Balon's brother Euron, who <em>would</em> have been the heir under agnatic (male-only) primogeniture rather than agnatic-cognatic (male-preferred).</span>
</li><li> Queen Selyse is very concerned with producing a male heir for her husband, at one point claiming that their marriage bed was cursed because Robert drunkenly had sex with someone in it before they could consummate, and if Stannis burns the resulting child as a sacrifice she will be able to give him sons. Stannis himself seems far less concerned, referring to his daughter Shireen as his heir, and ordering that she be crowned queen in the event of his death.

But Ta'a Chume, the Hapan queen, never had a daughter, so her daughter-in-law, from the primitive and also matriarchal Dathomiri, becomes the new queen.

One of the book's key intrigues rests on ensuring (via an elaborate deception) that Roelstra's fourth and current wife bears â€” or <em>appears</em> to bear â€” a son.

</li><li> This trope is played with by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SheriSTepper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SheriSTepper">Sheri S. Tepper</a> in three novels. In <em>Six Moon Dance</em> the founding mothers of the planet Newholme create an artificial scarcity of female babies, and a dominant ideology that females are the stronger sex and males are the weaker, leading to the population desiring female heirs. In <em>Raising the Stones</em>, the power derived by males from their heirs is eradicated by legally denying the father-child relationship. Heirs are only accepted through the maternal line, and any male claiming fathership is frowned upon. And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGateToWomensCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGateToWomensCountry">The Gate to Women's Country</a></em> the women and men of the story live in different quarters, and when a male comes of age they must choose which quarter they permanently wish to live in. If they, for example, choose the men?s quarter, then their mother can no longer claim them as an heir; if they choose the women?s quarter, then the father no longer has fathership.

It's never outright stated, but women are shown to be just as capable of inheriting and holding titles in this world as men are. For example, the Viscountess Ubarr is the one who holds power in her territory, not her husband, and her daughter is her heir.

Vivia also notes that while there's no formal rule about the gender of the Council members, all women eligible for a seat end up sending a male relative in their stead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At least until the end of the second book.</span>

When the Duke of Norfolk says it's impossible for a woman to lead an army, Cromwell does remind him that Mary Tudor's grandmotherâ€”Isabella of Spainâ€”did just that and gets told to butt out. As Anne Boleyn approaches birth he also tries to get the proclamation-writers to leave enough of a gap on the drafts to write 'ss' after the word <em>prince</em> just in case, considering it to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Tempting Fate</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">with reason</a>).

The crew lands on a Sebacean breakaway colony where succession goes to the eldest child regardless of gender, but the law states that a husband and wife must rule together. As such, the princess cannot become empress unless she finds a male who can give her children before she reaches a certain birthday (and, due to some gene poisoning by her brother, only Crichton fits the bill).
</li><li> The episode "Heart of Gold" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> has Burgess, a man who knocked up a whore and wants the child, as it is male, for an heir.

However, according to Septa Mordane, the Iron Throne can only go to the closest male relative. The one kingdom in Westeros which averts this is Dorne; Dornish law provides for absolute primogeniture, meaning that the oldest child inherits, regardless of gender.
<ul><li> In spite of this, Stannis names his sickly daughter Shireen (his only child) as his heir. However, Stannis' lack of a son, and the fact that he doesn't get on with his wife (meaning that the odds of a legitimate son being born are slim) plays a big role in the tension with his wife.

</li><li> Aeron is the first to cast doubt on Yara's position as heir to the Salt Throne, giving her a blunt reminder that the Ironborn have never once elected a Queen. The fact that he invoked that Yara should be elected when Balon was never elected is a further indication of his sexism. In the books, Aeron argued for an election because he disagreed with Balon's choice of Yara/Asha as an heir and also because of a genuine succession dispute between Theon, Victarion, and Euron, who had physically seized the throne upon Balon's death. The Kingsmoot hadn't been held for <em>centuries</em> before the Conquest, later Ironborn Kings like the Hoares were hereditary monarchy.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus">book of Numbers</a>, the daughters of Zelophehad come to Moses with a problem. Their wealthy father has just died, and they have no brothers and are not married, but it's accepted in this society that women cannot inherit property or titles. Moses takes this issue to God, and God comes up with a solution that's pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">Fair for Its Day</a>: they <em>can</em> inherit their father's property, but they must marry men from their own tribe. (Note that this only applied in cases like the above, where there were no sons or sons-in-law to be the inheritors; if they had a brother, or if these women were married, the property would go to their brothers or to their husbands, not them.) And if they had sons later, the property would be passed onto them.
<ul><li> Even earlier than that, this was the idea behind the custom of levirate marriage: that is, if a man died without any heirs, his widow was to be married off to his brother (whether she wanted to or not), and their first son would carry on the deceased man's lineage.

Next in line is a boy named Shelah, who is conveniently not old enough for marriage yet. Her father-in-law Judah, believing Tamar to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartwrightCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartwrightCurse">cursed</a>, tells her to move back in with her parents and wait until Shelah is old enough, which she does. Eventually, as Shelah gets older, Tamar realizes Judah has no intention of marrying her to Shelah, and there are no other brothers Tamar can marry. So, in response, Tamar disguises herself as a shrine prostitute, and sleeps with Judah, making sure to take his seal, cord, and staff as collateral. Three months later, when her pregnancy begins to show, and Judah sentences her to be burned to death for engaging in illicit sex (thus shaming the family), she reveals that the father is the owner of these items.

</li></ul></li><li> Archaeological troves of marriage contracts (including lists of which property each person brought into the marriage, which would be jointly owned, and which would not) and other legal documents show that, in Ancient Israel under the Law of Moses, women could and did own, purchase, sell, inherit, and pass down property to/from both male and female members of the family (as well as, in the case of buying and selling, unrelated people). The issue with Zelophehad's daughters was that they would be the sole inheritors of the entire family property, which included land that was the inheritance of their entire tribe, hence the decision that they could only do so as long as they married within their tribe; the child's Hebrew/Jewish status comes from the mother, and tribe from the father, so they needed children who were members of their tribe to inherit their tribal land. In the Bible itself, there are several examples of women owning/inheriting land, like Caleb's daughter and the "virtuous woman" of Proverbs 31.

Agnatic inheritance only allows men to rise to power, Agnatic-Cognatic allows women to inherit if there are no valid male inheritors (but still prefers women with male issue to ones without), and Absolute Cognatic is gender-neutral (but can only be enacted if your ruler is of the Basque culture or follows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic">Catharism</a>, or if you add the <em>Conclave</em> DLC and enact laws to expand women's rights).

Neither of these are actually implemented in the game, obviously, but they can be modded in if one wants.

<ul><li> Seven European countries have done away with this all together: Sweden, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. In other words, these countries provide that a woman can inherit the throne even if she has younger brothers (sometimes known as "absolute primogeniture"). The first of these changes was passed in Sweden effective January 1, 1980, and so far no woman has actually inherited a crown via absolute primogeniture; Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria is likely to eventually become the first woman in the modern world to inherit a crown despite having a living brother.
</li><li> The British example is, as usual, a little bit odd, in that it was only passed in 2013 but would not make a difference to the current succession as Prince George, the first royal child born after the law change, is the oldest child and thus would've had the same place in the succession under the old laws (Though it does mean that his sister will inherit before their younger brother should anything happen to George).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8qe5d');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8qe5d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8qe5d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Bear in mind that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealth">Commonwealth Realms</a> put a substantial wrinkle in this; see below for details.</span> In fact, none of the British monarchs since 1910 (George V, Edward VIII, George VI, Elizabeth II, and the future (presumably) Charles III,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9mx49');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9mx49" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9mx49');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or George VII, if he decides to ditch the "Charles", as he's suggested he might do</span> William V, and George VII<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10u2v4');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10u2v4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10u2v4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or George VIII, if his grandfather decides he wants to be George VII</span>) would have been or would be affected by the change. You have to go back to 1841 when the future Edward VII was born a year after his older sister supplanting her as heir to Queen Victoria.
</li><li> Of the other European countries that still have monarchies, Spain and Monaco have succession laws like the UK had until 2014, i.e. male-preference primogeniture (younger brothers inherit the crown before their older sisters), although Spain has some vague plans to adopt absolute primogeniture for the successors of current King Felipe VI (not that it really matters; the King has only daughters). Liechtenstein follows what's known as "semi-Salic law", in which a woman can only inherit the crown if the entire royal family runs out of male heirs, including her own sons. Another once-common succession law was the "Salic law" (the non-"semi" version), in which only male descendants in male line could inherit the crown at all; this was applied in France and some other countries, but none of the extant European monarchies still follow it.
<ul><li> While Spain tries to get absolute primogeniture, there is already a law that states that when a new King ascends and a new Prince of Asturias (heir apparent) is appointed, nothing can move them from there. So, once a Princess of Asturias is appointed, she is the heir even if new brothers appear later on (which is still possible with the young King Felipe VI).
</li></ul></li><li> The Disunited Kingdom:
<ul><li> It was this issue that started a period in English history known as The Anarchy, when Henry I named his lone surviving child, Matilda, his heir. It was a bit more complicated, in that not only were the Anglo-Norman barons wary of having a woman on the throne, but her husband was from Anjou, Normandy's rival. A faction of barons helped Stephen of Blois onto the throne, which plunged England into 19 years of civil war until a resolution was reached where Stephen's own sons would be bypassed for succession in favor of Matilda's son, the future Henry II, who was the founder of England's Plantagenet dynasty, which of course produced some of England's most famous kings, like Richard the Lionheart, Edward I 'Longshanks', and Edward III.
</li><li> Matilda's son Henry II profited from this when French king Louis VII grew so worried over his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine so far only bearing daughters that he had his marriage annulled (officially on grounds of consanguinity) even though that meant losing control over Aquitaine. To make matters worse from Louis' point of view, Eleanor then married Henry II (handing over Aquitaine to England) and bore him four sons, including Richard the Lionheart and John Lackland. Of course from Henry Plantagenet's point of view that may have been too much of a good thing because his sons kept conspiring and fighting against each other as well as against their father.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII of England</a> divorced his first wife because of this. He even went so far as to reject the Roman Catholic Church because they wouldn't annul his first marriage. He had some justification â€” his father was an upstart who'd taken the throne after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">long civil war</a>, and he couldn't be sure a daughter would be accepted. To make matters worse, enemies could make a very good case that each of his daughters was illegitimate â€” and in the case of Elizabeth, that she wasn't even his daughter. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor">The House of Tudor</a> for more on him and his family, including Elizabeth I.
</li><li> To be clear, Elizabeth and Mary were both legitimate at birth, but the marriages of both of their mothers were later invalidated and they were thus declared illegitimate for a time. And Elizabeth was almost certainly Henry's daughter (he himself noted similarities between them) but her mother's alleged adultery meant that her legitimacy could be questioned.
</li><li> In a clever compromise to get around this trope, the later Mary II and her husband/cousin William of Orange, a Dutch nobleman who was the quasi-hereditary chief magistrate of the Dutch Republic, were appointed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingCouple">equal co-monarchs</a>. This was seen as the best of both worlds: William was the first male in line to the throne in his own right, and despite being a foreigner he was more importantly at the time a Protestant (and as an added bonus was comfortable with the idea of an assembly placing constitutional limits on his authority, which was another major interest for Parliament); meanwhile, Mary was a woman, but she was also a direct descendant of the established dynasty and the first Protestant in line for the throne (if women weren't barred). As a further bonus, theirs also seems to have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a>. The only <em>minor</em> hiccup was that Mary's father James II was still alive at the time, and being deposed for Catholic sympathies. (Ultimately, William and Mary had no surviving children, so after they both died <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Mary's sister Anne succeeded them, ruling in her own right</a>.)
</li><li> Nowadays, the UK is moving beyond this: Until recently, women could inherit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">if they had no living brothers</a> (male-preference primogeniture), but on the announcement of the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy a new law was passed so that her children (and any future generations) will inherit in age order regardless of gender. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">No such luck for Princess Anne, though, who is still stuck behind her two younger brothers and all their children</a>. Since the Duchess' three children (as of 2018) were born male - female - male, this law prevented Princess Charlotte from being dropped below her younger brother Prince Louis in the succession, even though neither will ever sit the throne unless something happens to their older brother Prince George.
</li></ul></li><li> Germany and nearby areas:
<ul><li> The Kingdom of Hannover was once in a personal union with the United Kingdom, but they followed the Salic Law (forbidding women to take the throne) while Britain did not; this caused a split when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Victoria</a> became Queen (her uncle Ernest Augustus became King of Hannover instead). This was generally regarded as a good riddance in Britain, where many saw the monarch's German territories as an unwanted Continental entanglement, leaving Britain with less of a free hand to mess with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfPower">Balance of Power</a> (which had been English and then British policy, enabled by its island status, since at least Tudor times).
</li><li> The House of Hapsburg lucked into Castile/Aragon/Burgundy/the Low Countries because the Houses of Valois and TrastÃ¡mara married a princess into their dynasty and failed to pop out a male heir. To avoid being on the receiving end of this the two branches of their house swapped most of their princesses between the Spanish and Austrian courts. The long term effects of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Carlos_segundo80.png">this policy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>â—Š</small>... did not <a class="urllink" href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~monarchs/madmonarchs/carlos2/carlos2_bio.htm">work out too well<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession">Madrid branch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the male line of the Vienna branch puttered to a halt not long afterward with <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Austrian_Succession">predictable results<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (luckily for them, the line continued through Maria Theresa and her children were content to take the Hapsburg name).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">Maria Theresa</a> of Austria had her father's approval but not anyone else's. When a series of unfortunate events killed all available male heirs, her father issued a pragmatic sanction that left the Habsburg domains to her. He paid many rulers to accept it and not contest her claim to the throne once she would succeed him. Of course, when he did die, many thought this was a prime opportunity to go back on their word and grab some land. It mostly didn't work out (Silesia was lost to Prussia, the Habsburgs <em>almost</em> gained Bavaria, but otherwise Maria Theresa went on to rule the Habsburg domains for 40 years).
</li><li> Much like the Kingdom of Hanover decades earlier, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was obliged to break off a Personal Union in 1890 due to Salic Law. King Willem III of the Netherlands was succeeded upon his death by his 10-year-old daughter, while Grand Duke Guillaume III of Luxembourg was succeeded by his 73-year-old 17th cousin once removed Adolf/Adolphe (the dispossessed Duke of Nassau). Of course, when Adolph's only surviving son Guillaume IV had nothing but daughters he chucked Salic Succession anyway leaving his throne to 17-year-old Marie-AdÃ©laÃ¯de in 1912.
</li></ul></li><li> France through history:
<ul><li> The Frankish Salic Law that prohibits females from inheriting noble titles in their own right dates from the 6th century, although until the end of the 14th century it applied only to the inheritance of property. It was first invoked with reference to the succession to the throne in the 15th century, half-way through the Hundred Years' War. In the succession crises after the deaths of Philip IV the Fair and his youngest son Charles IV the Fair, the French greats and their legal experts had excluded females from the succession without mentioning the Salic Law. In both cases, other aspects â€” a notorious case of marital infidelity on the part of several princesses and the fact that the greats of France did not want an English king â€” played a part. Up until Charles IV, the Capetian kings and their queens had, almost incredibly, always managed to produce one or more male heirs in every generation.
</li><li> When France still had a monarchy there were laws against women inheriting the throne. It wasn't that the French considered women unfit to rule â€” women acting as regents was permissible, as shown by the example of Blanche of Castile, who ruled France during the minority of her son Louis IX (Saint Louis) and also during his absences for his two Crusades. It was just the contention of French lawyers and theologians that the French King was too holy and sacrosanct for that office to be held by a woman.
</li></ul></li><li> In ancient Rome, if you weren't able to produce a biological heir, adopting one worked just as fine. In fact, the majority of Roman emperors inherited the empire after having been adopted by the previous emperor. Some even disregarded their biological children in favour of an heir of their choosing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a>, for example, had a son by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII">Cleopatra VII</a>, but chose to adopt his sister's grandson as his firstborn son and made him his heir instead. This adopted son later became known as Emperor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Augustus</a>, who in turn adopted his wife's first son (fathered by her previous husband) as his heir. This proved to be a smart tactic, as often the person who seemed best suited to take over the empire would be adopted by the emperor, instead of trusting that pure biology would make someone a great leader.
</li></ul></li><li> Much like Ancient Rome, the royals of the many kingdoms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a> had similar rules. It was quite common to adopt or nominate an heir to the throne if none were to be had through procreation (they did mostly tend to be male, though women rulers were not uncommon). The British were, understandably enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">none too pleased with the situation when they landed up,</a> since it took away a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation">major exploit</a> they'd used in Europe for their power plays, and promptly introduced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">much-despised "law"</a> known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">Doctrine of Lapse</a>.
<ul><li> Under this law, of a Ruler had no legitimate heirs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">(i.e. from procreation)</a>, their lands would "lapse" into the control of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">''rightful''</a> rulers of the land - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">the British East India Company</a>. The East India Company, unsurprisingly, also was in the habit of <em>falsely</em> claiming that rulers had died without legitimate heirs even in cases where it was plainly obviously that the had a legitimate, non-adopted son to take their throne.
</li><li> To say that this "law" was deeply unpopular is putting it mildly. 1857 showed just how much it was hated - while the Indian Government today likes to style the uprising of 1857 as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">First War of Indian Independence</a>, a more pragmatic observation is that it was largely the local nobles (and their armies, of course) doing most of the killing and maiming - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">all Britishers they could get their hands on, almost all of them being Company officials or their mercenaries</a> - in retaliation for them trying to snatch their lands away. Good luck trying to find anyone who sympathises with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">the Company</a> in India today though - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">it's a touchy subject.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRaj" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRaj">The Raj</a> that came afterward, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">understandably enough</a>, withdrew the law - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">And There Was Much Rejoicing</a>. For the nobles anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> As of 2011, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealthOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonwealthOfNations">The Commonwealth of Nations</a> has begun the process of changing to equal primogeniture<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11vu5e');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11vu5e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11vu5e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and also removing the bar on those who had married Catholics to succession to the throne; however, the requirement that the monarch be a Protestant has not been removed, as he or she will continue to be the Supreme Governor of the Church of England</span> and the Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth Realms have all agreed in principle to the modification. However, as the Commonwealth monarchy is governed by separate but identical laws in all the Commonwealth Realms, the change requires parliamentary approval in all Realms save <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand">New Zealand</a> and Papua New Guinea. Canada and Australia create further problems: it will require the approval of all ten <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianPolitics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianPolitics">provincial parliaments</a> and all six <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianPolitics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianPolitics">state parliaments</a>, as well: the Canadian provinces and Australian states are legally distinct monarchies, so their separate but identical laws would also need to be changed. Some feared that Quebec might hold up the process as a means of getting long-desired concessions from Ottawa, particularly as that the sovereigntist Parti Quebecois was in power at the time the agreement was reached, but as it turns out the main hurdle in Canada has been court challenges over arcane points of Canadian constitutional law (and Canadian constitutional law can be <em>incredibly</em> arcaneâ€”it makes American constitutional law seem downright straightforward),<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note129i9y');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note129i9y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note129i9y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As of writing (March 2015) these challenges are still ongoing. The most likely to cause problems is that the Canadian federal government found what they think is a loophole they used to avoid the requirement that all ten provinces separately approve the changeâ€”a loophole they used primarily because they were afraid that Quebec would trip things up. While this is the most solid challenge legally, it has become politically irrelevant: Quebec kicked out the PQ quite resoundingly in April 2014, replaced by a Liberal government unlikely to use the monarchy as a bargaining chip.</span> while the jurisdiction that has delayed passing the legislation the longest was Western Australia, which simply took a very long time in getting around to holding the vote (a senior WA MLA has basically admitted that their reason for the delay was "erm, we forgot").
</li><li> Parodied in <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080313035311/http://www.theonion.com/content/news/clinton_chastises_hillary_for">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion">The Onion</a></em>.
</li><li> The implications of China's One Child Policy is that, since families want male heirs because of Chinese tradition, they've been having (or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">keeping</a></em>) too many sons and not enough daughters, which means not enough wives to go around once they grow up (which anyone could tell you is what happens when it's only acceptable to have sons!). Oops! The government eventually had to compromise by allowing girls to inherit their family name and giving families "incentives" (read: money) to have baby girls before just ditching it altogether in early 2016, but 35 years of the policy (even with the numerous exceptions that meant it only applied to about half of all Chinese couples) means that by about 2020 there will be somewhere between 24 and 36 <em>million</em> more Chinese men than women of marriageable age (the lower-bound estimate comes from the Chinese government themselves).
</li><li> In Hong Kong, according to Small House Policy, the indigenous villagers can build small houses in the New Territories, which is known as the "Ding House", each owner has the "Ding Right", a right to construct and pass the lands to their male heirs, this right cannot be passed to their daughters since by Chinese tradition, a clan's legacy can only be succeeded by the male heirs.
</li><li> India has not been immune to the same pressures: despite the absence of a policy <em>requiring</em> that families limit their size, increasing prosperity and a government awareness campaign on overpopulation have caused many Indians to want to limit the size of their families (typically 2-3 children). However, the traditional attitudes remain, and many Indian women selectively abort female children, although this is technically illegal. While the gender ratios in India are nowhere nearly as skewed as in China, it is a problem that the Indian government is taking quite seriously.
</li><li> In Japan, there was a decades-long controversy about there not being a suitable male heir to inherit the Imperial Throne, to the point that a constitutional amendment was in the works to allow at least partial female inheritance. Fortunately(?) Princess Akishino gave birth to Prince Hisahito in 2006, meaning that the question was staved off for at least another generation. The Empress was not seen in the public from 2002 to 2019 to seek treatment for adjustment disorder with her husband Emperor Naruhito issuing statements that he's concerned with the health of his wife. The remarks, unfortunately, earned the crown prince rebukes from the then Emperor Akihito and Prince Akishino while the comments became part of the debate on whether females can really ascend the throne.
<ul><li> The laws barring women from ascending to the throne are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">Newer Than They Think</a>, only dating back to the 19th century. Throughout Japan's history, eight women ruled when there were no eligible men.
</li><li> It's not just a question of whether women can ascend to the throne but whether women can even pass on the right at all. According to current laws, any princess must renounce all titles upon marriage and is no longer considered to be a part of the imperial family. None of their sons are eligible to become emperor. This is supposedly done to keep the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather">unbroken line of patrilinieal succession</a>. One proposal on the table is to permit married princesses to remain in the imperial family and thus provide more opportunity for heirs.
</li></ul></li><li> In Russia Peter I the Great had set down a house law that monarchs could appoint their own successors, as a consequence of which his throne was first inherited by his widow Catherine I and which probably contributed to the succession being settled by palace coup a number of times during the 18th century. After a period that saw three more ruling Czarizas, Czar Paul I, who bore a grudge against his mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a> for deposing his (supposed?) father Peter III and allowing him to be murdered (and also because she possibly wrote a will that removed him from the line of succession and gave the crown to Paul's eldest son, Alexander), then enacted a new house law that henceforth excluded women from the succession. The Pauline Law was technically semi-Salic and did not exclude women from succession totally, but any male heir was preferred to any female. Since then, there were no regnant Empresses / Czarizas in Russia. The last Czar's only son was hemophiliac (which prompted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk">Rasputin the Mad Monk</a> to enter the picture), and a decade or two later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">this became a moot point anyway</a>.
</li><li> In Korea, a father who's had multiple daughters in a row is referred to as being "rich" as a way of gently needling him for continuing to try for a son without due consideration of the financial burden of supporting the children he already has. Bonus points if the man does have a son who's much younger than his eldest sister.
