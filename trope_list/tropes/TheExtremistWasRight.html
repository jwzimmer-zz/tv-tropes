Their ideas about how to go about making the world a better place are appropriate, and not only are they genuinely working toward a better world, they've <em>succeeded</em> in doing so, or else succeed during the course of the story. These are genuine examples of that term that so many villains falsely claim to be, necessary evils, within the context of the story.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense">Omniscient Morality License</a> is a common result of this trope being mishandled; though if the one doing this is a god or God, then the issue gets even more contentious.

<ul><li> Lelouch Lamperouge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> starts off on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> armed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">the Geass of Command</a>; by the end, he's not only saved the world from his father's mad scheme to force <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">a "World Without Lies"</a> upon all humankind, but he's executed an insane gambit to unite the world in peace by becoming the cruelest dictator of all time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit">and at the moment of his ultimate triumph, being publicly assassinated by his best friend in the guise of the very hero he himself created</a>. We are informed that it succeeds, though unlike the former case, very little time is spent explaining <em>why</em> Lelouch is right, and how the plan actually works.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em>, during the Despair arc, Nagito Komaeda threatens to shoot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Junko Enoshima in cold blood. Chiaki Nanami tries to argue that murder is never right, but given the fact that Enoshima would go on to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">cause the end of human civilization as we know it</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">simply to cause as much despair as possible</a>, everyone really, really would have been better off if the gun didn't jam.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> in the argument of the god like digimon over how to save their world, it turns out the plan of the well intended extremest who acted very brutal towards the child protagonists was the only one they could use in the end. Pity half their world was destroyed. Still, his was the only plan that worked if even temporarily.
</li><li> The trope could be well called "Oberstein Was Right" after Paul von Oberstein, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">utterly amoral</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">his quest to reform the Galactic Empire and obtain peace</a> (as shown when, during the Imperial Civil War, he allowed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">High Nobles</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">murder two million people in a nuclear attack</a>, an act that is considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> in-universe, for propaganda value) whose plans have the disturbing habit of working (that nuclear attack drove public opinion firmly against the High Nobles, and started causing mass defections in the enemy). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">This is the only reason Reinhard and his other subordinates put up with him</a>: they despise his personality and utter amorality but respect what he's doing and that he's <em>good</em> at it.

<ul><li> Aeolia Shenberg in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> believes that the human race is inherently corrupt and warlike, and must reform itself to get rid of war... by force, if necessary. It takes him and his shadow organization Celestial Being 200 years to put their plans into motion, but it works. By AD 2500, humanity has evolved into a race of telepaths and are completely free of war... all by Celestial Being's manipulations. This viewpoint is virtually identical to the one held by Char Aznable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</a></em>, except Char's methods were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">far more destructive</a> and he was portrayed as being very much in the wrong in that film.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Rustal Elion commits many atrocities on behalf of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Gjallarhorn</a>, teams up with some very unsavory individuals like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Nobliss Gordon</a>, and ultimately has many of the heroes killed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">succeeds in destroying Tekkadan</a>. Thanks to all this, he is able to replace the Seven Stars as ruler, reform Gjallarhorn into a democracy, outlaw slavery, and set up his talented lowborn adoptive daughter as his heir rather than leaving yet another corrupt/incompetent/depraved aristocrat to take his place.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> gets this quite often. Just look at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">how horribly humanity treats mutants</a>. The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen">Wolverine and the X-Men</a></em> actually looks like a second holocaust, which is <em>exactly what he's always trying to warn the X-Men about</em>. Not to mention his own country, Genosha, was a peaceful sanctuary. (Y'know, before the Sentinels)
</li><li> On the other hand, most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Futures</a> and alternate realities such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast">Days of Future Past</a></em> storyline where humans have subjugated or killed most of the world's mutant population is sparked by Magneto and/or his followers' own extremist actions.
</li><li> Zigzagged with the villainous nation of Genosha, which argues that their policy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutantDraftBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutantDraftBoard">enslaving all mutants</a> is essential to preserving the lives of their nation's human population. It's played straight in that not only does their nation genuinely benefit from its mutant conscription program, granting a life of incredible luxury to the human population of what was originally a barren and near-worthless chunk of rock, butr ultimately, there <em>is</em> a mutant vs. human war when Genosha is forced to stop enslaving their mutants, and their nation is ultimately rendered into Magneto's personal "mutants only" nation. It's subverted in that this rebellion is a perfect example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>, since the mutant slaves were treated in ways that literally came out of the Nazi concentration camp textbooks, only turned up a few notches, making their brutality an obvious retaliation for what was done to them first.
</li><li> During his coup d'état of Genosha Magneto had to contend with a Genoshan radical named Zealot, who opposed Magneto because he believed Mags had only his own interests at heart rather than the interests of Genosha's citizens, and that he would ultimately bring ruin to the island nation. Zealot is played as a villain during his appearances (which were brief, as Magneto ruthlessly killed him off), but later storylines would go on to prove him <em>completely right</em> in his assessment of Magneto. Not only did Magneto's regime fail to stabilize the war-torn nation, it ultimately made things <em>worse</em> and paved the way for Cassandra Nova's wholesale slaughter of Genosha's mutant population. Not content with proving Zealot's point hard enough, Magneto returned after the island nation had been reduced to an uninhabited rock and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">leveled it entirely with a bomb</a></em>, simply to announce to the world that he no longer had any intention of "laying low". Somewhere in the mutant afterlife, Zealot's palm has permanently affixed itself to his face.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em> averts the trope, implying that the anarchist state V created via his terrorism may turn out to be just as bad a place as the fascist state he overthrew. The film adaptation plays it straight with no fear of a possibly dark future portrayed.
<ul><li> There is also the question of the Norsefire regime. The book is quite clear that while the Norsefire regime is a totalitarian and high-handed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState">Police State</a>, and that countless atrocities have been committed by it, that same high-handed leadership is the only reason Britain survived the Third World War as well as it did. The film, again, does away with this angle entirely.
<ul><li> A big difference is there's no nuclear war in the film version, which even Alan Moore admits would be impossible to survive. Also, V is more willing to hand over power to the people as an anarchist versus keeping it all under himself.

The sentient inhabitants of Earth are completely wiped out and reborn sometime later as ponies, and, as Captain Pio had said it would, strife and war were all gone because the ideologies of the world before were almost completely wiped out.

So things like torturing animals or attempted rape are punished far more harshly than murder due to negligence.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor">Thor</a></em>, Loki engineers Thor's banishment to Earth because he felt he was unfit to one day take over as ruler of Asgard, something that is shown to most definitely be <em>true</em> at the start of the film. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">Unfortunately for Loki</a>, being banished to Earth and stripped of his powers was exactly the kick in the backside that Thor needed to temper his hot-headed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a> attitude with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">patience and restraint</a>, as well as some much needed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">humility</a>.

</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">Thor: The Dark World</a></em> the trope becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> to where it could almost be inverted: facing Odin for his actions on Earth in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>, Loki claims he is merely following in the footsteps of Odin's father, Bor, and of Odin himself, and that he would have been more suited to the crown than Thor. Notably, Odin doesn't <em>dispute</em> this so much as point out that Loki is a war criminal for slaughtering civilians on Earth. And Odin's actions for the rest of the film, including his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">cold-blooded strategy</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldBeRudeToSayGenocide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldBeRudeToSayGenocide">dealing with the Dark Elves</a>, makes this clear to Thor. Thor realizes that he'd rather be a good and heroic person, protecting the innocent and doing what's right, instead of a king who'd have to be willing to sacrifice others and other pragmatic decisions. So once again Loki gets proven right about Thor bring unfit, but for opposite reasons: Thor wants to be <em>better</em> than a king.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em>, to counter Ultron and his ability to jump his consciousness into the internet, Tony hatches a mad science plan to create another A.I. to upload in an artificial body. This leads Captain America and the twins to attack him to prevent the upload (since it was a similar scheme that created Ultron in the first place), but in the end it was the Vision that was key to permanently defeating Ultron.
</li><li> In Thanos' backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em>, he warned his homeworld Titan that they were headed for extinction caused by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverpopulationCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverpopulationCrisis">Overpopulation Crisis</a>. He proposed a solution where half the population would be randomly selected to be killed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCalledMeMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCalledMeMad">but was called mad and ignored</a>. As he predicted, his people did die out and Titan turned to a lifeless wasteland, which he took as validation of his view. He has since gone from world to world, killing off half the population on each to prevent a repeat of the disaster that happened on Titan, and wants to acquire the Infinity Stones so he has the power to do it all in one fell swoop. On Gamora's homeworld at least it seemingly worked, but it's also expressed in the movie there can be other less extreme solutions for dealing with overpopulation, and even that Titan's own ruin might not lie in the overpopulation, but rather that it is axially off-tilt. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">5 years after he manages to do just that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, it turns out not to be the paradise Thanos thought it would, but it is mentioned that some aspects of the world are improving, showing that he was right to a small degree, but the small improvements do not come close to making up for the downturn of crumbling societies across the universe.</span>.

Now jump forward to the climax, with Magneto surrounding the White House with a full stadium levitated from across the state and with the life of the President in his hands, and with another mutant already infiltrated among the President's most trusted people... and say again that Trask was exaggerating, or that his concerns were unjustified.

And it does work. There's absolutely no delusion or incompetence involved. One part of this is how he doesn't try to forcibly control most things but only exerts his absolute power at strategic points. (Commander Vimes, however, believes that just because Vetinari's way of doing things may work, doesn't make them <em>right</em> per se. However, Vimes shares a common opinion with the vast majority of people and institutions in Ankh-Morpork: as much as they may disapprove of Vetinari and his methods, they realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity">it's better than the alternative</a>.)

As enforcers of the Laws of Magic, they hunt down and execute any violators after, usually with only a cursory trial. They openly admit that they use execution in preference to other options, such as training or rehabilitation. Harry frequently rants about how unfair and unjust this practice is, but is ultimately forced to admit that their tactics have prevented the rise of innumerable dangerous warlocks over the centuries.
<ul><li> A big part of the reason Harry sucks it up is that he knows that black magic, even when used unintentionally, is addictive, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">leads to more and more</a>.
</li><li> The political nature of the White Council also applies. By removing themselves from non-magical affairs, the Council has minimized the formation of internal factions and the chance of splintering due to internal conflict over events in the non-magical world.
</li><li> There's also Martin's attempt to take down the Red Court, namely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">selling out Susan, Maggie, the Fellowship of St. Giles in order to gain Red King's trust, and then taunt Susan about the betrayal in order to goad her into killing him.

</li></ul></li><li> A running theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em>: sometimes good men have to do truly terrible things in the service of the greater good. That these men have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense">extremely accurate future sight helps</a>, of course. Best exemplified by Leto II's "Golden Path", which involves turning himself into a quasi-immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a>, subjugating the entire human race for thousands of years knowing that they will chafe under his rule as a tyrant, and keeping an iron grip on a monopoly of Spice upon which all society depends... all in the name of planting the seeds for the Scattering, in which humanity spreads out across the galaxy so completely that it's nigh-impossible for them to ever be killed off completely.

By the time the third book rolls around he is "Peter the Hegemon," the man who united humanity via Machiavellian politics, the vilification of his own brother Ender ("the Xenocide") <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SockPuppet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SockPuppet">Sock Puppet</a> bloggers.

</li><li> The later books do a good job of explaining that. His character in <em>Ender's Game</em> is just what Ender could see - and Peter got some character development.

</li><li> Graff and Rackham also have shades of this trope. Graff at least (possibly Rackham as well) is fully aware of how insane and extreme his methods look to outsiders (i.e. everyone but him). Graff doesn't bother sugar coating anything, he doesn't even guarantee his plan will work, and he's keenly aware that even if it does, he's probably going to be tried for war crimes. He just believes it's the only way to assure there's a leader ready for the next war against the Buggers.

<ul><li> The early rulers of the Targaryens had this going on — in spades. Aegon the Conqueror came from Dragonstone and toured the kingdoms, saw what a fractured, disorganised mess they were... and conquered most to hammer the lot into some kind of less wasteful shape under a single ruler and a codified body of law. It worked. Maegar the Cruel went over the top with the cruelty against everybody, but especially when taking the Faith Militant on, but the Faith of the Seven as it was at the time <em>was</em> a major destabilising factor for the continent: it worked, at cost to himself.

The Thallonian Empire brought peace to the warring races of their sector by conquering them all, forcing squabbling factions to settle on different planets, and generally ruling with an iron fist.

As Ezar himself was put on the throne by a bloody civil war to get rid of an insane emperor, he knew <em>exactly</em> how bad that would get. As a bonus, it also purged and discredited the overly militaristic, expansionist faction as well, and weakened the nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">Ministry of Political Education</a> to the point where Ezar was able to destroy it with a staged riot.

In a show where every cast member has engaged in highly morally questionable acts in order to do good, every one of them sees this as going too far. And yet, it is only the promise of the cure for the disease that convinces the Founder in charge of the armed forces to surrender peacefully when she is captured.

<ul><li> The Bronze Faction of the Sidereal Exalted orchestrated the Usurpation, a massive uprising against the reigning Solar Exalted of the First Age. Although it resulted in the deaths of millions and vast swathes of destruction across Creation, it also averted an even worse fate that they had predicted would come to pass if the status quo was maintained.
<ul><li> The Gold Faction, notably, contests this version of history, which has been a point of contention within the ranks of the Sidereal Exalted for thousands of years.
</li></ul></li><li> The same goes for the Scarlet Empress. Sure, she did some pretty bad things to gain control of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Sword of Creation</a>, used it to make herself the undisputed ruler of what she made the most powerful empire in the world, and created a series of oppressive vassal states and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">a ruling class fixated on self-aggrandizement and low-level infighting</a>, but she also used the Sword to save Creation from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">the raksha</a>, made sure they could never come back to finish the job, and spared Creation the constant intense (civil) wars that characterised the regime preceding her reign.
<ul><li> The entire POINT behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a> was to distract a few thousand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers">Super Soldiers</a> from trying to make trouble in the empire by giving the Terrestrial Exalted Luxury, worshipful admiration from the populace... and to keep them busy. The Empress even designed the infrastructure of the Realm to make it utterly impossible for it to function without her (there had been a few attempts at overthrowing her... which ended in having the Sword of Creation turned on the rebels), leaving the Nobles to squabble over bits and pieces of influence and power within the Realm, which was more or less manageable. This worked for over seven centuries... until she vanished and the entire system starting plunging rapidly towards Civil War.

And if that doesn't work? The would-be criminal generally "disappears" before they can actually commit a crime. The result? A happy, fearless populace and the lowest crime rate in all of Khorvaire.

<ul><li> The NCR imposes heavy taxes on citizens, often would rather shoot first and ask questions later, and limits water to the point where far too many barely have any to drink. However, it's still one of the best places to live, as security and trade allow a high standard of living, and there is some semblence of democracy and individual freedom - there is no slavery, and mutants are welcomed (mostly). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact, siding with the NCR is pretty much the only way to get a happy ending to everybody who deserves one, as even a good-aligned Courier campaigning for an Independent Vegas will have to make certain sacrifices, and they just won't have the resources to look after everybody right. A prime example is the town of Primm, who initially chafe under NCR taxation, but safe under the protection of NCR troops, the town grows to become a prosperous trading centre</span>.
</li><li> Mr. House is a Machiavellian schemer who can't stand sharing power with anyone and ignores those who aren't useful to him, but if he wins, he turns New Vegas into a safe, stable and prosperous state in its own right, with comparative social freedoms. He furthermore goes on to revive advanced pre-War level industry so that humanity may expand into space and no longer be dependent upon what is left of Earth.
</li><li> The Boomers are an <em>intensely</em> isolationist and xenophobic society of ultra-violent gun nuts. However, they also live in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Mojave Wasteland.</a> Their paranoia has led to Boomer territory being arguably the safest and most self-sufficient around, with morale and quality of life abnormally high by Wasteland standards.

Thousands of years later, Bronquia is still going strong, and Gulcasa is a beloved historical figure. (It helps that Gulcasa is Gulcasa.)
</li><li> The end result of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> story was chiefly due to internal forces conspiring within Blackwatch to subtly manipulate Alex into doing what they could not overcome on their own, and hence fulfilling their mandate.
</li><li> The final DLC of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> has Shepard being forced to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">detonate a mass relay and sacrifice a solar system of <em>three-hundred-thousand people</em></span> in order to slow down the arrival of the Reapers. While this works, the rest of the galaxy considers the Reapers to be a myth, with the upper echelons of power discredit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCassandra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCassandra">Shepard</a> as delusional or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">worse</a> leading straight to...
<ul><li> ...<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, which picks up several months later. Shepard is now discharged from the Alliance and going to trial for his/her actions, which gets interrupted when the Reapers finally descend upon Earth. Unfortunately, by the time we get to see the Council, the invasion is well underway, so we miss their initial shocked/horrified reactions to the fact that Shepard was right all along. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amusingly, it's the resident air-quoting Turian Councillor Sparatus who ends up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">the first of the Councilors to offer Shepard aid</a> in the form of vital intel.</span>
</li><li> Interestingly, though, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the same upper echelons of power who are busy trying to discredit Shepard never actually revoked Shepard's SPECTRE status in the interim between <em>Mass Effect 2</em> and <em>Mass Effect 3</em></span>...
</li><li> It's somewhat telling that even after being proven <em>right</em>, Shepard still remains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Hero with Bad Publicity</a> due to their actions;
<div class="indent"><em>"The enemy are referred to as "Reapers", a term once used by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">disgraced</a> Commander Shepard."</em>
</div></li><li> As a corollary to that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Illusive Man. Indoctrinated though he may have been, his belief in controlling the Reapers is one of the three ways Shepard can choose to save the galaxy (even though the Illusive Man himself could never have taken control). Additionally, the 'Control Reapers' Ending is the only one wherein the Citadel isn't severely damaged, possibly saving many lives.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, Maelon, a former student of Mordin's, is revealed to be conducting brutal experiments on live test subjects in an attempt to develop a cure to the Genophage. After dealing with him, Shepard is given the choice of whether to either preserve the data or to destroy it. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the data becomes vitally important in the third game to ensuring the survival of the last female krogan immune to the genophage.</span>
</li><li> In the Citadel DLC of <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, one of the videos you can see from the Citadel's historical archives show that the first Spectre was a salarian operative who used 30 civilians to flush out a criminal, whose ruthlessness in getting the job done managed to impress the Council of that time.
</li><li> Shepard can also be this with regards to the geth, krogan, quarians, and the rachni for advocating <em>against</em> mass violence and outright genocide. Each of these races are considered dangerous pariahs, but by working with their leaders and trusting in them to do the right thing, Shepard can save them from annihilation and earn their trust. That trusting in and helping these species is considered radical really says something about the various Citadel races.

<ul><li> Early in their history, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Dunmer</a> people were plagued by ceaseless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllowedInternalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllowedInternalWar">open warfare</a> between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">Great Houses</a>.

The Morag Tong maintain a strict policy of impartiality, accepting any job provided it is proposed in the correct manner and with the proper payment. Because of its official sanction, the guild has the authority to print legal bills known as Honorable Writs of Execution, which excuse a Tong agent of all legal misgiving associated with any Tong related business. While legal assassination certainly seems like an extreme solution to any problem, the Morag Tong keeps the Great Houses of Morrowind from starting an all-out war by confining the conflicts in a much smaller scale. The threat of being legally assassinated mostly keeps the Great House leaders in line and prevents significantly greater death and destruction from happening.

</li><li> The end result is the victory of the "traditional" heroes when the Justice Lords attempt to clean up the League's Earth (out of what appears to be nothing more than the goodness of their hearts) and the message that "sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Doesn't Justify The Means</a>", but the writers professed the occasional trouble at giving the League the obvious moral high ground.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in a fantasy episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. Bart as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">David</a> loses to Goliath's son, Goliath II (Nelson) and spends years training for a rematch while Goliath II sets himself up as king. When David finally returns and defeats Goliath II, the locals angrily tell him that Goliath II was the greatest king they had ever had, building hospitals and schools and ending hunger and unemployment. They form a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">mob</a> to take revenge on David, but the police (also established by Goliath II) take him away for murder/regicide and control the crowd before anything can actually happen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>: The Autobots do a lot of questionable things to win the war, and though not much of it is onscreen, its established that war itself is an ugly thing. Ultra Magnus commissions large fighting machines with severely limited intelligence so they can kill enemy soldiers and not question the morality of it, also so they'd be easier to control. Prowl was shown to be arrested for not participating in the war and forced into the Autobots side. The Autobots action are against the Decepticons, who've destroyed a few planets, left one planet a flaming husk, and commissioned far more WMD's. They've shown a willingness to unleash terrible chemicals in biological warfare, regardless of the effects on the environment and their own soldiers. The Autobot's actions lead to present day Cybertron which is peaceful, prosperous, and has technology connecting them to dozens of other planets all over the galaxy.
<ul><li> The show also makes it clear when extremism is needed and when it's excessive with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyBadExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyBadExample">Sentinel Prime</a>. Ultra Magnus' actions ended the war, in spite of people like Ratchet thinking he's taking things too far, and he was able to transition to a peacetime ruler. When Sentinel Prime takes over, he makes Cybertron a police state, and strikes against the Decepticons without considering all options. His inability to listen to reason nearly blew a hole in the planet.
</li></ul></li><li> In Book 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendOfKorra">Legend of Korra</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Kuvira, started her road to world conquest after her mentor and leader Suyin refused to help stop the violent crime and all around chaos that was happening in the Earth Kingdom after the Queen was assassinated, despite having more than enough resources to do so. Given that the Avatar was nowhere to be found, which lasted 3 years, she felt the need to step up and restore order. Furthermore, she was right about the future Earth King not being fit for the job of leadership, which he would admit after she was defeated and gave up the throne. Granted, her point is undermined by feeling a need to "restore order" to the areas that <em>weren't</em> plunged into chaos in Korra's absence (including Republic City, which isn't <em>part</em> of the Earth Kingdom). Also despite her claims that the Earth Kingdom having a monarch was an outdated notion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">she still had no trouble</a> replacing the (admittedly unfit) prince <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">with herself</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>: Pharynx was universally despised by the rest of the changelings for being a total asshole, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackShirt">preferring things under Queen Chrysalis' rule</a>, preferring their old dark appearances, and believing the changelings were now weak and unable to defend themselves. He's ultimately proven entirely right on the last point as the changelings have no hope in fighting off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever">massive maulwurf</a> unless they toughen up and relearn how to fight. The episode ends with Pharynx learning to lighten up and the rest of the changelings learning that total passiveness and non-violence can't solve everything.
