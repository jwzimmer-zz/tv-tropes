These combat uniforms are designed for many practical needs, including a lack of highly-visible markings or bright colors to help the soldier blend into the environment better. This results in fatigues crafted in either a neutral monochrome or a camouflage pattern, with the flashy dress uniforms reserved for ceremonial purposes. Officers wear the same outfits as enlisted men (except for the rank insignia) so that they can't be singled out by the enemy.
</p><p>In fictional works (especially visual ones), this line of thinking gets thrown out the window, causing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Redshirt Army</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMinions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMinions">Evil Minions</a> to charge into battle wearing uniforms that turn them into walking targets. Leaders and Officers are even worse, often charging into battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">elaborately gaudy outfits</a> to emphasize their leaderness. Despite such recklessness, the wearer never suffers any negative repercussions for doing so (or at least no more than those offered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander">some</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">tropes</a>).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Still, the setting may justify doing away with visual camouflage, especially in case the enemy doesn't depend on human spectrum vision to target the opponents, be it using infrared, echolocation or some kind of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuraVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuraVision">Aura Vision</a></em> (or just different visual recognition patterns, because most camouflages are adapted to deceive the human perception). Another justification is (ab)use of civilian equipment like a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazmatSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazmatSuit">Hazmat Suit</a></em> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">cargo manipulation exoskeleton</a> in combat.
</p><p>This trope typically manifests in the following ways:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Bullseye Badge:</strong> The uniform has a highly-visible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashTheSymbol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashTheSymbol">easily-targeted symbol of their organization</a> in a vulnerable location, such as the upper torso or on their helmets. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">The Laws and Customs of War</a> require soldiers to wear a symbol that visibly separates them from civilians, but not to such ridiculous extremes. Some works will attempt to justify this trope by saying the badge is intended to draw fire to an armored portion of the ensemble. Often occurs due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SigilSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SigilSpam">Sigil Spam</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Highlighted Hue:</strong> The uniform is a single bright color that's entirely inappropriate for their environment, such as neon orange in a night mission. Contrast with real-world armies, which issue fatigues of different shades and/or patterns to troops based on the combat terrain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> works are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">especially prone to this, since brightly-colored toys sell better</a>.
</li></ul><p>Of course, it's entirely possible to combine both instances into one huge Uniform of Impracticality, as seen in the trope illustration.
</p><p>In historical works taking place before the time around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as a lot of armies really did wear ridiculous uniforms back then; uniforms with adaptive coloring didn't become widespread until the twentieth century. France in particular didn't adopt some sort of camouflage for regular soldiers until <em>1914</em>. Indeed, using bright colors to aid identification of allies during combat made a lot of sense at the time, given that muskets tended to be extremely inaccurate at distances over 100 yards and a lot of the combat infantry fire was conducted at even closer range. Meanwhile the commanding officers had to know where their units were, which was the reason why even units with less conspicuous uniforms (e. g. Russians dressed in dark green, Prussians dressed in dark blue, Swedes dressed in dark blue or grey, Portuguese dressed in brown) carried large and highly conspicuous colours, standards or guidons. Even when breechloading rifles were introduced in European armies, colored uniforms still served a purpose in identification amongst the gunpowder smoke until smokeless powder was adopted.

Colus, for example, seems to be a big importer of pre-reunification West German surplus.
</li><li> France from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> has a bright blue and red military uniform as opposed to the dull colored uniforms his fellow Allied Forces wear. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in one strip where France wears a boring grey inform instead of his usual one, when England questions why France explains that French army's colorful garb made it ridiculously easy for the Italians to aim at them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WinterCicada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WinterCicada">Winter Cicada</a></em>, Kusaka wears one while fighting in the Boshin war. One wonders how in the heck they could even fight with those helmet-hair thingies.
</li><li> The bright blue uniforms worn by the Amestrian soldiers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> are definitely this.
</li><li> Everyone in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> franchise is dressed this way. Justified in the case of the mobile suit pilots and naval officers (who aren't trying to hide) but played unfortunately straight by the rest of the military personell.
</li><li> In several adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em>, pilots wear brightly-colored flightsuits.

</li><li> The World Salvation Committee from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SandsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SandsOfDestruction">Sands of Destruction</a></em> wears pale blue and white uniforms in a world that's largely desert (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandIsWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandIsWater">including the ocean</a>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em> plays with this and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority">Law of Chromatic Superiority</a>. While standard Terran forces paint their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mechas</a> in typically drab military colors, protagonist Inaho and his companions start out in bright orange training units. Inaho keeps the color scheme even when his mech is upgraded.
</li><li> High-ranking members of the Black Organisation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> usually wear all-black clothing, leading to the organisation's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname">In-Series Nickname</a>.

The actual explanation given in the Episode II Visual Dictionary (canon status questionable as of the EU-reboot) is that clone troopers fear no-one and <em>want</em> their enemies to see them coming; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">The Clone Wars</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">Rogue One</a></em> there are some camouflage variants seen.

They are also said in <em>Legends</em> to see in the ultraviolet spectrum, so it is possible that didn't see camouflage as a priority near the start of the Clone Wars.</span>
<ul><li> Legends has also stated that the Scout Troopers on Endor were actually Storm Commandoes, an elite special forces unit that typically wears black scout trooper armor. The fact that the wore white on Endor was part of the Emperors trap, to lure the Rebel strike team into a false sense of security. And it worked, if the Ewoks hadnt intervened the strike team would have been executed, the Rebel fleet would have been destroyed.

</li><li> Part of it is also proof of identity: the stories take place in a pre-industrialized world, so bleach is not easy to come by. Very few people are able to afford a pure white outfit and the expenses involved in <em>keeping</em> it white, which means that it's very difficult for someone to impersonate a Herald, due to the costs involved in faking the uniform.

<ul><li> The Jaffa had the sigil of their god tattooed (or painfully gold-plated) on their foreheads, but it's usually hidden under their armored helmet. The glowing red eyes of said helmet, on the other hand, definitely stand out. However, it makes sense when you realize (as is specifically pointed out from time to time) that the Goa'uld and Jaffa are a "modern" military force <em>solely</em> in terms of technology. In terms of organization and tactics, they're strictly tribal/feudal. Their armies are meant to be seen and feared, to cow people into submission through displays of power rather than through actual ability. When the Jaffa begin to rebel in solid numbers, they begin to accept human-style weapons and tactics because the human way of war is to <em>kill</em> the enemy effectively and efficiently, while, while the Goa'uld way is to <em>intimidate</em> enemies who are either of similar composition or essentially defenseless civilians.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the hundredth episode where a TV show based on the Stargate program is being made.

The actor argues that an alien wouldn't <em>want</em> to be seen, and Jack points out that this may be why all the aliens are dead. The actor finds this very helpful.
</li><li> The same is true for the Ori armies, whose goal is to show off the glory of the Ori and who use staff weapons similar to the Jaffa.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> The typical Starfleet uniform is a single-color shirt with matching pants. In many situations, representing the Federation is partly shown via uniform-wearing (especially in <em>Insurrection</em> when Picard <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">resigns his commission temporarily</span>). Therefore, if they are acting as diplomats or ambassadors, then they need to be easily identified. Many times in the various series, characters disguised themselves to blend in when on a hostile planet. In the original it was usually via costume, and in the later series surgical alteration was used to transform the characters. However, somewhat justified in that Starfleet personnel, as their name suggests, on board a spaceship most of the time and are thus in theory unlikely to be personally shot at (though this doesn't explain why away teams didn't wear subdued colors as a matter of course).
</li><li> The later series gradually phased out the bright colors in the uniforms in favor of black and gray. Limiting the colored part to the shoulders and eventually just an undershirt. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em> also has quite reasonable dark blue uniforms.
</li><li> Starfleet personnel in ground-combat situations sometimes wore <a class="urllink" href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Starfleet_uniform_%28late_2360s-early_2370s%29#Combat_jacket">a variant uniform<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where the colour was limited to a shoulder-flash. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrekExpandedUniverse">Star Trek Expanded Universe</a>, these uniforms are called Surface Operation Blacks, and the most recent version has even removed the shoulder flash.
</li><li> The Bajoran Militia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> zigzags this. Garrison-duty Militia officers such as Kira Nerys wear bright colors (red and dark pink for command, gray and green for technicians, orange and blue for medics, gold for security), but Militia on field duty, as seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS03E24Shakaar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS03E24Shakaar">"Shakaar"</a>, wear grey.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> continues to put Starfleet in brightly colored uniforms, now royal blue with metallic accents, but with the twist that they put a black overlayer on when they're expecting combat (it resembles a flak vest).
</li></ul></li><li> The miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983">V (1983)</a></em> has this trope relating to the 'visitors' themselves. As the 'visitors' only dressed up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a> in the first place to appear friendly to humans, it is reasonable for them to not be wearing camo or body armor as that would've rather spoiled that image.

<ul><li> VIPER from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em> Universe has their symbol prominently displayed on their uniforms. Earlier editions had their heroic counterparts UNTIL doing the same, but the most recent incarnation goes for the more subtle (and more realistic) approach of just putting the badge on their headgear and uniform sleeves.
</li><li> Possible in a game of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, depending on how you and your opponent painted your models. There's also canonical examples in the background:
<ul><li> The overwhelming majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marines</a> eschew camouflage in favor of their chapter's color scheme, some of which are rather garish (the Howling Griffons' quartered yellow and red, for example). They're also a fully justified example: Space Marines are inhumanly tough, wear armor that's proof against all but the heaviest weapons, and know what their reputation as the God-Emperor's Angels of Death does to enemy morale.
<ul><li> Despite this (and the page quote), Space Marine Scouts wear camouflage and less bulky armor (still superior to standard flak though). Justified not only in that they're, well, scouts, but because they're at the very beginning of their careers as Space Marines, and they don't have all the implants or bioaugmentations that allow them to wear their iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a>.
</li><li> This overall attitude has begun to shift slightly as of the Indomitus Crusade. All the new Primaris Marines have been outfitted with stealth and reconnaissance training, and complements of specialized Vanguard Marines were dispatched to each marine chapter. Notably, Vanguards (especially Eliminators) prefer wearing drab and camouflaged cloaks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthyColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthyColossus">over their power armor.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The countless regiments of the Imperial Guard can play this straight or avert it. The Cadian regiments prefer drab olives and tans or camouflage suited for their current campaigns, while the Mordian Iron Guard is famous for fighting in bright blue dress uniforms. Though in the Mordians' case, this is justified since they come from a night world with a history of weathering Chaos assaults, where the ostentatious uniforms are important for visibility and morale. They also fight in the open in tight infantry blocks instead of using stealth and maneuver, so they would stand out just as much in appropriate fatigues.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar</a> warriors can be brightly-colored depending on their Craftworld of origin or what Aspect Warrior shrine they belong to, but their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Harlequins</a> are some of the most flamboyant units in the entire game. Of course, being able to <em>see</em> a Harlequin is not the same as being able to <em>hit</em> them - as Eldar they are already inhumanly fast and agile, and on top of that all Harlequins fight with anti-grav "flip belts" allowing them to cross the battlefield in great leaps and bounds, as well as holo-fields that turn them into swirls of brilliant colors.
</li><li> Orks may fall under this when they fight under their clan colors (the Bad Moons' traditional scheme is a lurid yellow decorated with black flames, for example), and they also have superstitions about certain colors, so some soldiers paint themselves bright blue for luck (fanon holds that an ork kommando painted purple and orange is the epitome of sneakiness, because have <em>you</em> ever seen one? Of course not! That's how good they are). Vehicles will often be painted red, because as we all know the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOnesGoFaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOnesGoFaster">Red Ones Go Faster</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Much more prevalent and justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, the medieval <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy">Low Fantasy</a> game. Imperial State Troops wear resplendent uniforms, eye-watering colour combinations under steel armour and hats with very large, colourful feathers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: the troops' style is emulating the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsknecht">Landsknecht<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mercenary soldiers of 15th/16th Century Europe.

Their most common nickname isn't "Targets" for nothing.
</li><li> Some characters and military groups in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse">expanded universe</a> are guilty of this. In many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy">prestigious units</a>, mechwarriors do not bother putting camouflage on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">BattleMechs</a>, such as the Knights Of the Inner Sphere painting their mechs a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.camospecs.com/images/schemes/29_Urbie1stKnightsInnerSphereAlbatross.jpg">blindingly obvious white<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> or chrome with gold highlights. The 1st Marik Militia likewise uses highly conspicuous liveries - their primary color setup is bright purple with blue and red highlights. However, more pragmatic units and units in the field tend to use more realistic camouflage on their mechs. Infantry, tanks, and aerospace fighters, on the other hand, are generally in more appropriate camouflage. Somewhat justified, as even the smallest actual battlemech<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3s12h');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3s12h" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3s12h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">smaller mechs do exist, but use a slightly different ruleset</span> is at least eight metres tall and runs off a power source that has a significant thermal signature even when idling, rendering camouflage rather pointless.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em> it should be pointed out that this is mostly seen in the art of various adventures, rather than the actual text, but it often seems strange to see something like Soviet soldiers wearing Ushankas outside <em>their secret hideout on Mars</em>, which unlike in our reality is an incredibly hot world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantChronicles">Mutant Chronicles</a></em>: Zig-zagged by the Venusian Rangers, who are famous for wearing pristine, snow-white armor. The fluff claims this is an artifact left over from the (highly useful and realistic) arctic camo the Rangers wore during their first big deployment in Venus' polar regions during the Dark Legion War, and is maintained to commemorate the victories won there. It is also mentioned that many Rangers (who are elite assault troops rather than light infantry) believe that they have no reason to try to hide (and given that according to the crunch Ranger armor is completely impervious to small-arms fire and grenade shrapnel, they may have a point), but that many units also paint their armor in more location-appropriate camo schemes rather than maintain the iconic white.

Team Rocket tend to wear black uniforms with a big red R on the chest, probably the most inconspicuous; then again, they're probably the most well-known organization in the country they're in, so they'd still be noticed. Team Aqua wear blue and white pirate-like uniforms, Team Magma wear gray and red hooded uniforms, but these two tend to show themselves in public the least out of the villainous teams. Team Galactic are rather well-known and wear typical "space-traveler" uniforms, gray and blue and really make no effort to hide themselves (they've got extremely villainous buildings just standing there in the middle of goddamn cities) and are mostly ignored due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">Apathetic Citizens</a>.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe">G.I. Joe</a></em> cartoons and comic books almost always give the various Cobra army uniforms large iconic cobras, ordinarily in bright blood red. The Crimson Guard (who provide the page image) are actually a bit of a subversion, as they're not frontline troops, but Cobra Commander's most elite forces. One has to have a degree in law or accounting to even be eligible to join, although scientists and others with highly specialized, and valuable, skills have been included in the ranks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname">Siegies</a>, when not serving directly at a Cobra base, are deployed out into the world to infiltrate society, spying on enemies and legally earning money to be funneled back to Cobra. Usually, when you see this uniform, it's within Cobra-controlled territory, and if it's on the frontline, it's likely during a Cobra civil war. That being said, standard Cobra ground troops wear bright blue outfits that fit this trope pretty well.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers">Autobots and Decepticons</a> always have their corresponding faction sigil visible from the front, usually either on their chest or their forehead/helmet.

<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_coat_(British_army)">British Redcoats<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who wore bright red uniforms with white crossbelts. This was before camouflage was much of a factor in warfare. The bright red color helped commanders keep track of troop movements amid smoke-covered battlefields. The color also blended together when British troops stood together, making it difficult for enemies to count their numbers.
<ul><li> British uniforms subverted this trope on long enough deployments. Between the dirt they picked up and the fading of the cheap dye used for enlisted men's uniforms, they would wind up khaki after a year or so of field wear. This is why the British turned to khaki when they abandoned the red.
</li></ul></li><li> Musicians (fifers and drummers especially) were often uniformed in the reversed colors to the regular soldiers (British musicians would have coats of their unit's facing color faced in red for example). The reason was simple, so the officers could locate them (the musician was the equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommunicationsOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommunicationsOfficer">radioman</a>, drumbeats carried better than voices). Trumpeters especially would also occasionally be sent towards enemy lines bearing messages or to accompany an officer sent to parley with the enemy. Here conspicuousness was also a desired effect.
</li><li> The French continued their use of the Highly Conspicuous Uniform into the early days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, when the British and Germans had switched to more practical khaki and field grey, respectively. The French had considered alternative colors, but the problem was that they would have had to buy dyes from <em>Germany</em>. However, the story of bright uniforms is exaggerated, with most frontline troops having more reasonable uniforms. The Conspicuous Uniforms were mainly Reserve or Dress uniforms that were pressed into service because of an extreme dearth of proper ones.
</li><li> Whilst the uniforms were camouflaged in WWI, it was a considerable time before Officers' rank marks were removed from the cuffs. A lot of Officers were shot gesturing with a hand above trench-level before rank markings were moved to a more discreet location on the shoulders.
</li><li> While German armies were intelligently camouflaged, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoseArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoseArt">this was not so with their air force</a>. Germany's premier pilot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedBaron">Manfred von Richthofen</a>, popularized the idea of painting aircraft with bright colors for quick recognition from friendlies when he painted his own aircraft red.
<ul><li> But then military airplanes that were painted to camouflage them were painted to be camouflaged while standing on the ground. The paint jobs generally were not that useful in flight, while especially for flying in larger formations - like Richthofen's "Flying Circus" - the leader(s) had to be easily identifiable by the rankers, especially because communication had to be done optically (hand-signals, waggling wing-tips etc.) before the introduction of radio communication between the pilots in the inter-war era.
</li></ul></li><li> Some French soldiers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> had the "Bullseye Badge" variant. A special patch, worn on the chest, over the heart, represented the <em>bleu, blanc et rouge</em> of the French flag as a circle with a blue rim, a white inner circle, and a red dot in the center—that's right, a <em>literal</em> bullseye target.
</li><li> In a more modern situation, the US Air Marshals, whose entire purpose was to sit anonymously on planes so that potential hijackers or terrorists wouldn't know if there was one on board, were for some time required to dress in business attire, even if everyone else on the plane was dressed looking like they were ready to hit the beach. Even more insanely, they were required to show their ID at the gate and get on the plane before the other passengers. After this was publicized in the media by air marshals who'd been complaining that undercover agents should actually try to be undercover, they changed the rules. At least one marshal, before the rules were changed, decided to use these rules to his own advantage. Since it was practically impossible to be incognito, he would make a <em>deliberate effort</em> to stand out, making it clear that <em>he</em> was the marshal of the plane, so that if anything did go wrong, his partner at least had a <em>chance</em> of being ignored.
</li><li> Real life Bullseye Badges: Allied tanks after the invasion of Normandy carried the US white star on their sides. When a lot of destroyed allied tanks were found to have a neat hole punched in the middle of said star, they were drabbed-down with mud or paint.
<ul><li> German vehicles at the time of the invasion of Poland had a national insignia that was a white cross (on dark grey vehicles). After discovering that Polish troops used the cross as a target marker, the white cross was first overpainted with yellow, then later with a black cross painting out the middle of each arm leaving four white corner angles, then went off into lower-visibility variations.
</li><li> Modern air forces mostly have two-tone grayscale versions of their "official" roundels and insignia. Compare the two on the page for the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force">Royal Australian Air Force<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>.
<ul><li> Two other examples would be the RAF Roundel where peacetime it was Red, White, and Blue but during WWII they made the white either very narrow or left it out and the BIG Red Rising Sun on the flight decks of Japanese aircraft carriers. In fact, in Midway, one of the bomber pilots aimed directly at the big red spot on the <em>Hiryu</em> and hit it.
</li><li> In late 1944 and 1945, more and more British naval assets were deployed to the Pacific to join in the war on Japan. Hard experience, of trigger-happy American gunners who had never seen British aircraft before, suggested that it would be a <em>really</em> good idea for British aircraft to lose the red circle in the middle of the roundel. Thus royal Navy carrier aircraft were distinguished by a blue and white roundel only.
</li><li> Note that until partway into WWII, the roundel used by American planes was a blue circle with a white star and a red circle centered in the star. Guess why American warplanes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe">no longer have a red circle in their roundel?</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with the "invasion stripes" used by the Allied air forces during the Normandy invasion. Of course whatever remained of the Luftwaffe in the area was a far smaller threat than friendly fire, so pretty much Justified.
<ul><li> Not to mention the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoseArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoseArt">various color schemes</a> used by aviators on both sides throughout the war. Some units, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleSquadron">American Volunteer Group</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedTails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedTails">Tuskegee Airmen</a>, are as famous for their paint jobs as they are for their achievements in the war.
</li></ul></li><li> "Stripping the paint" for aircraft in WW2. The British and Luftwaffe scorned it because it made the aircraft shiny and blatantly obvious. The US 8th Air Force simply didn't care; more than once it was actually suggested that they <em>wanted</em> enemy aircraft to find them, so the enemy would engage and be destroyed.
<ul><li> The actual reason for using the minimal bare-metal finishes on the American planes, of course, was that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">cheaper and faster to build and deploy the aircraft if they didn't waste time painting them first.</a> It was also pointed out that the olive-drab favored by the Army didn't exactly blend in with the skies of Western Europe to begin with, which was where the Germans tended to run into them anyways.
</li><li> There was also the point that the coat of paint actually reduced performance (because it added weight) - an unpainted B-17 was 8mph faster than a painted one and an unpainted P-51 was up to 16 mph faster. Also, the olive drab was primarily of value in making aircraft parked on airfields less visible to people attacking that airfield - in WW2, by 1944, US airfields weren't often attacked. These days camouflage is primarily aimed at optically-guided missiles.
</li><li> During the Cold War, US Navy aircraft usually had a base coat of white paint, with <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:F-14-vf-84.jpg">various attractive color schemes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. Beginning in the late 1980s, the US Navy began moving to a low-visibility gray scheme on all aircraft, with the idea meant to reduce visibility in dogfights (for Tomcats and Hornets, <a class="urllink" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Navy_050131-N-0000S-002_An_F-14B_Tomcat,_assigned_to_the_Pukin%5Ersquo,_Dogs_of_Fighter_Squadron_One_Four_Three_(VF-143),_and_the_squadron%5Ersquo,s_new_aircraft,_an_F-A-18E_Super_Hornet,_fly_in_formation.jpg">seen here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>) and for some measure of camouflage for support assets (i.e. helicopters). Because of the unpopularity of the move, in order to have its cake and eat it, the Navy allows the certain aircraft in each squadron to be painted in a special <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:F-14_over_Pula.JPEG">high visibility color scheme.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> The development of radar means that visual camouflage is no longer as critical as it used to be, but it can still be useful in a dogfight, with both pilots relying on the Mark 1 Eyeball.
</li></ul></li><li> The Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy faced the same problem with their planes having big red dots, which were used as bullseyes by American planes. The IJN arguably was a worse offender, given their planes were painted bright white.
<ul><li> In a compensating move, Allied forces revised their markings. The prewar US aircraft marking had a red circle in the middle of the white star. This was removed in 1942 after it was discovered that overeager pilots would fixate on the red dot and attack any aircraft displaying a red circle marking, even if it was only part of a larger marking; the RAF/RAAF similarly painted over the central red dot of their insignia with white for aircraft in the Pacific theater.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfTheColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfTheColdWar">Cold War</a> offers a particularly grim example: The strategic aircraft (bombers and the interceptors designed to fight them) of many nations were often painted glossy white. Called "anti-flash white," this color scheme was applied because white is the best heat reflector and it was expected that these planes would be flying near nuclear explosions if they went into combat.
</li><li> The cockade used by the enlisted men of the Finnish Defence Forces has been a <a class="urllink" href="http://tietokannat.mil.fi/np03/data/images/149_press.jpg">literal blue-and-white bullseye<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> for the longest time. It's the butt of quite a few local military jokes.
</li><li> If the enemy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst">unscrupulous</a>, medics and civilian emergency vehicles still have this problem. While the main reason for putting big red-on-white crosses/crescents on medical assets is to proclaim they're not a threat and to encourage the enemy to direct their attacks elsewhere, the conspicuous markings can indeed backfire if the opposition suspects a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanHorse">Trojan Horse</a>. And yes it's still illegal to give weapons to medics featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRedCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRedCross">The Red Cross</a>, which is the second reason the Red Cross is barely seen anymore.
<ul><li> This <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i31UzeaVJA">Bill Cosby routine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> sums up the disadvantages of being a conspicuous wartime medic pretty well.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> American officers had a particular white marking on their helmets, which officers at the time would go out of their ways to smudge with mud to hide. It was noted once that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks">Tom Hanks</a>'s character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan">Saving Private Ryan</a></em>, for instance, would have in real life known better than to leave a bright white "I'm an officer, snipe me!" mark on his forehead.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted Trope at times during War On Terror operations in Afghanistan. Special Operations Forces troops sometimes have as their assigned mission to blend in with, gain the confidence of, train, and fight beside native irregulars. To that end they wear native dress, let their hair grow (to an extent) and grow beards (to the Afghan tribesmen a beard denotes manhood). Occasionally a Pentagon commando general officer will take it upon himself to try and make them "...present a more military appearance..." by ordering said troops to shave, get haircuts, and wear "proper uniforms". Such an order is invariably ignored by the field troops if their chain of command passes it on and doesn't just bury the order somewhere in the piles of paperwork any modern army generates.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, some Canadian troops in the early months of the war in Afghanistan were issued green/brown "temperate woodland" camouflage, due to a lack of beige/brown "arid region" uniforms.
</li><li> Similarly, a number of British and US troops had to make do with jungle-pattern camouflage BDUs during Desert Storm, as there weren't enough desert-pattern fatigues in storage and the jungle-pattern was at least designed for hot weather.
<ul><li> Until Multi Terrain Pattern uniforms were issued to the British Army, British troops in Afghanistan had to wear a mix of Desert and Woodland camouflage, as Helmand province's terrain can quickly go from green to brown and back again.
</li></ul></li><li> Training gear used by many non-deployed military units will give off the impression of either this or a poorly-equipped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a> due to various mismatching camo patterns on the gear. Seeing an airman in the grey tiger-stripe ABUs, with a woodland camo BDU patterned kevlar vest, and a sold green helmet (or even a helmet colored with the Army's ACU digital camo) can be a sight to behold, even before they then don a bright reflective belt for safety's sake. Remember, of course, that old gear is often used for training, while they would save the newer stuff for when they actually need it.
</li></ul></li><li> Soviet penal battalions in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> reportedly made to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">exploit</a> this trope sometimes to act as decoys (e.g. being dressed in dark uniforms in a snowy environment to draw enemy fire to themselves instead of regular Red Army units). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">Yes, the people who ordered they do that didn't care about their chances of living</a>.
</li><li> The United States military combat uniforms (the Army Combat Uniform, and before it, the Battle Dress Uniform and Desert Combat Uniform) all feature a patch with a reflected United States flag on their right shoulder <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5mmm0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5mmm0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5mmm0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">It is depicted the way the flag would actually appear if a soldier were carrying it.</a> The flag typically goes on the right side because that is the position of seniority when more than one soldier are marching side by side. If the soldier is moving forward, as if he were advancing, the flag would trail behind him, and would thus appear reversed from the right side, because the blue field is always closest to the flagpole. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButIDigress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButIDigress">Of course, if you had a strong wind at your back, the flag would be the other way.</a> The same observation can be made with aircraft bearing the US flag, when viewed from the right.</span> When deploying into a location where red, white and blue blend in poorly, it's switched out for a less visible monochromatic version.
</li><li> The US Army's infamous "Universal Camouflage Pattern" ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/MikeBurnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/MikeBurnFire">So named</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/gq2x6d5G2KI?t=358">because it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>universally</em> doesn't blend in with JACK FUCKING SHIT!"), a grey-ish mess of a bad idea that fit in absolutely nowhere. A <a class="urllink" href="https://soldiersystems.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/img_6425.jpg">picture of a soldier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> laying down on a couch that actually matched the pattern went memetic, sometimes captioned as 'It finally blends in with something!". The Amry eventually issued MultiCam, an actually-universal camo pattern that lost to UCP, for troops in Afganistan starting in 2010, and eventually phased UCP out completly for its own MultiCam knockoff.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Guard">The Swiss Guard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> both plays this straight and subverts it. The official, well-known uniform is colorful as a peacock. The work uniform is much more practical.
<ul><li> Not to mention that looking like a Renaissance Faire reject is a great way to sucker a would-be papal assassin into dismissing you as harmless window-dressing. At least, until you pull a modern sidearm out of those poofy sleeves...
<ul><li> This tradition goes all the way back to the original medieval Swiss mercenary bands, who wore very colorful uniforms to announce their presence to their enemies and hopefully demoralize them with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">badass reputation.</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Admiral <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HoratioNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HoratioNelson">Horatio Nelson</a> wearing one of these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander">led to his being shot by a French marksman</a> at the cusp of his greatest victory at Trafalgar.
<ul><li> Although what rendered him conspicuous was probably less his officer's uniform than the decorations he wore.
</li></ul></li><li> The US Navy <em>loves</em> this trope:
<ul><li> Dress uniforms (the blue and the white sailor outfits) are explicitly meant to attract attention and their antique style stands out far more than other services, plus they tend to be required in any sort of public relations arena where other services still wear less formal uniforms.
</li><li> The new Navy Working Uniform or NWU. Similar to the new style of camouflage worn by the Marines, with a digital pattern of the standard fatigue design, the NWU is meant to evoke the style of tactical gear worn by other services. All well and good except for the color, a blend of blue and grey. For extra mileage, officers and senior enlisted have spots of gold coloring on them. Arguably subverted however, NWUs are meant to be worn in a shipboard or industrial environment and are designed not to hide the sailor, but to hide any paint or oil stains the uniform accumulates. Thus, while they might "look" more military than the utilities they replaced, they would be almost useless in an actual tactical environment. Not to mention that it's pointless for a ship's crew to camouflage themselves.
<ul><li> This is being replaced with a uniform of the same cut and general pattern, but different coloration (the new colors being relatively similar to the OCP pattern for the ACU).
</li><li> They ended up looking almost <em>exactly</em> like Russian riot police (OMON) in their white-blue-gray "city" camo.
</li></ul></li><li> US Navy flight-deck crews work in an environment which is loud, dangerous, often poorly lit, and very busy. Since being spotted by the enemy is not an issue, the various work groups wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">brightly-colored</a> jerseys in a <a class="urllink" href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fil:Coloured_flight_deck_jerseys.jpg">rainbow palette<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, so they can easily spot and identify each other.
</li><li> Averted with the parts of the Navy (like the Seabees and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NavySEALs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NavySEALs">SEALs</a>) who work where they might actually get shot at, generally with a copy of the more traditional fatigues from another service.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with Britain painting some recon planes pink during World War II. While they stood out garishly on the ground, when flying dawn or dusk flights the pink was actually the most effective camouflage color. In a similar manner the Long Range Desert Group 'Pink Panthers' look a bit stupid if seen outside of a desert.
<ul><li> Similarly-garish was the "dazzle" camouflage of WWI and WWII. Naval vessels were painted with big, blocky intersecting stripes. The point wasn't concealment but rather confusion as the odd lines and shapes made it difficult to determine the range, heading, size, and type of the ships so painted.
<ul><li> It turned out that transforming ships into sea-going zebras did not have the desired effect and in World War II this type of camouflage was not attempted again. However, the Royal Navy then did develop a special Western Approaches camouflage where ships were painted mostly white with a few light green and light blue areas. This was actually a pretty effective colour scheme for the North Atlantic.
</li><li> The Japanese navy often used land based camouflage patterns on its sea vessels, making them mostly green. The logic is that a ship will most likely be spotted at sea anyway and this way they could at least conceal ship movements between ports.
</li><li> Some ships used prominent camo on certain parts of the ship and actual stealthy camo on others. The goal here was to disguise them as entirely different types of ship.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> British police officers are frequently seen wearing bright yellow jackets or tabards with reflective panels over their regular duty uniforms. They provide a highly visible presence while on foot patrol and reduce the chances of being run down by a passing car during traffic stops, but can be something of a disadvantage when trying to approach the scene of an emergency call covertly.
<ul><li> Pretty well <em>all</em> police, firefighters, paramedics, and other emergency responders are required (or are in the process of and will soon be required) to wear some form of High Visibility Clothing (either as part of the clothing itself, or as a vest worn over it) in situations where they are supposed to be seen. Even, amusingly, military personnel if their duties dealing with civilians require it. Nothing like seeing someone in the latest digital camouflage wearing a bright orange vest with reflective stripes.
</li><li> The current (well, for the past 20 to 30 years in the USA) trend for police to be more "militarized" and wear military style uniforms (either very dark blue or black, or out and out camouflage) conflicts with the idea that police are supposed to be easily identifiable. If someone is pointing a gun at you or breaking into your house, you might think that it would be a good idea for you to be able to instantly identify if they are police or criminals.
</li></ul></li><li> For many years, the German police forces (aptly named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThinFormerlyGreenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThinFormerlyGreenLine">The Thin Formerly Green Line</a> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname">Senfmännchen (Mustard Men)</a></em>) wore a somewhat pastel-based assortment of colours on their uniforms, including moss-green jackets, mustard-yellow shirts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants">brown pants</a> and green or white caps. (Many police officers tended to wear black leather jackets on active duty, which was also permissible). This was for reasons similar to the British lime-green vests, but over the years the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixteenLandsOfDeutschland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixteenLandsOfDeutschland">Lands</a></em> changed their uniforms to dark blue, partly on the urging of the European Union to make all European police uniforms dark blue.
</li><li> UN peacekeeping tend to wear rather ordinary fatigues, but with sky blue helmets (Commonly with "UN" in white letters) and berets. Also, all their vehicles, including tanks, are painted bright white, with UN or the UN logo on them.
<ul><li> Some units of the British Armed Forces, most notably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen">Parachute Regiment</a> and the Royal Marines, have equally vibrantly-coloured berets as part of their uniform. These are often worn on foot patrols during counter-insurgency operations, partly because civilians find them less intimidating than helmets but mostly because the Taliban -and the IRA before them- have learned that those berets mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">serious professional opposition.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> According to an urban legend, around the time of the Vietnam War, some high-ranking idiot(s) in Taiwan's military had the bright idea of making their newly-bought tanks look more impressive by painting over the camouflage paint job... with metallic paint of the sort one might see on a brand new Ferrari. By the time their superiors found out, it was too late and the repainting was already done. So when those superiors told them what a stupid idea it was, they sanded off the paint, <em>including</em> the original camouflage paint, leaving the shiny metal underneath exposed. Hardly an improvement.
<ul><li> Out of desperation, some Soviet tanks produced during WW2 were sent to the battlefield unpainted. This was for various reasons including production time, likelihood of survival regardless of whether it was painted, and simple unavailability of appropriate or sufficient quantities of paint. Famous instances included the Siege of Leningrad and the defense of Stalingrad, in which the front line was a short drive from the factory gates - or in Stalingrad's case, ultimately <em>within the factory itself</em>. Those unpainted tanks which survived for long enough built a patina of rust, mud, and dirt which was almost as effective as painted camouflage.
</li><li> In besieged Leningrad, there was hardly any conventional green paint for military vehicles built at the local factories. As a Red Navy base, what the city had in abundance was battleship grey in various colours. Therefore tanks and vehicles on the Leningrad front were seen in two or three-tone grey camouflage schemes, which in a local context worked effectively.
</li><li> For similar reasons, British forces in Egypt in 1940 - a backwater low down the supply chain where it was thought a war would be <em>least</em> likely to break out - had practically no desert yellow paint. A massive influx of material from Britain, sent out to defend against an Italian threat, was in its European green. No yellow paint was sent out. Surplus paint held by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force was scrounged and the Caunter Scheme was devised to make the most of a bizarre assortment of colours. British tanks and weapons were seen in a geometric pattern using up to six colours, including battleship grey, sky blue, chocolate brown, khaki, green and ship's pale grey. What is most surprising is how well it worked in the desert.
</li><li> The first units of the German Afrika Korps also had to make do with European-style camouflage early in the campaign, for both their vehicles and uniforms. The OKH (Army High Command) originally figured that since just one of its 30 mobile (panzer and motorised) divisions would be operating in the African desert, there was no point in going to all the expense of ordering in special paint for it in any particular hurry. When Hitler took special interest in that panzer division's performance, and a full <em>four</em> of Germany's mere 250 infantry divisions were sent to North Africa to reinforce it, they made the necessary arrangements.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Red Devils" of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuJidai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuJidai">Sengoku Jidai</a> were so called because they wore bright red lacquered armor, unlike the brown or black armor of most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">samurai</a>. Their leader, Ii Naomasa, received a bullet wound at Sekigahara, possibly due to the conspicuousness of his red armor making him an easier target.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce">Japan Air Self Defense Force</a> pilots and aircrew stationed at Hokkaido wear bright orange flightsuits, deliberately invoking this, to aide in visual search in the event of an ejection over ice-cold water.
<ul><li> Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers wear red or orange wetsuits for similar reasons.
</li></ul></li><li> Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft are typically painted in generic military gray or green (for land-based helicopters), except for planes and helicopters which are specifically designated for search and rescue: they are painted yellow with red trim and a big red stripe. Their crews wear bright orange flightsuits or coveralls, their unit's headgear is an orange beret, the parachutes used by Search and Rescue technicians are bright orange with a black stripe and even their backpacks are orange or bright red. The purpose is to let people in trouble see that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> are coming.
<ul><li> This is common for dedicated SAR units around the world. The US Coast Guard paints most of its equipment in its most highly-visible colors. CG Red is a shade that's closer to Visibility Orange than anything else, and the Coast Guard's Dolphin helicopters, for example, are painted all CG Red with black and white trim. In Britain, the Royal Air Force uses all-over bright yellow for its SAR units while the Royal Navy prefers battleship grey with the tail-boom and nose in a colour not unlike CG Red, and the RNLI paints its surface craft all-over Visibility Orange above the waterline with a navy-blue lower hull.
</li><li> The Japanese Air Self Defense Force's Air Rescue Wing is an inversion; originally UH-60J Rescue Hawks were painted in a high visibility <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UH-60J_KAB001.jpg">white on yellow color scheme<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, but have since moved to a dark blue on blue <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:JASDF_UH-60J_(591)_tankt_bij_in_de_lucht_boven_de_Japanse_Zee,_-5_juni_2014_a.jpg">maritime camouflage scheme<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li></ul></li><li> Over the course of World War II the Waffen SS were issued uniform items in a multitude of camouflage patterns which often came in both summer and autumn colours. SS units also adopted camouflage clothing issued to the forces of other Axis nations and even borrowed items from the German army. By the end of the war it was not uncommon for Panzergrenadiers to go into combat wearing trousers, smocks, jackets and helmet covers which were in completely different patterns and colours to each other.
</li><li> Golf even has an iconic example of this. One of the highlights of The Masters, the first major championship of the men's golf season, is the award ceremony in which the winner is fitted with a distinctive green jacket. Even if he's won the event before. Said jacket identifies members of Augusta National Golf Club, the exclusive private club which owns and operates the tournament. All Masters winners become honorary members of Augusta National, giving them lifetime access to the club.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note666ra');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note666ra" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note666ra');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At least two Masters winners<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackNicklaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackNicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a> and Arnold Palmerwent on to become regular club members as well.</span> By club rule, the reigning Masters champion is the only person who can take his green jacket off the club premises. There's a practical reason for this restrictionthe members wear these jackets to identify themselves during the tournament.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7yol7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7yol7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7yol7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One Masters champion, Gary Player, kept his jacket, returning it to his homeland of South Africa. Though he violated the letter of the rule, he never violated the spirit, as he never wore it. He and the club eventually made an arrangement by which said jacket became an exhibit in his personal museum (open to the public) in South Africa.</span>
