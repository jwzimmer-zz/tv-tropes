</p><p>The human body is a remarkable machine, but it doesn't just run on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy">energy.</a> Ask any dietician: it requires vitamins, minerals, and a plethora of other substances in specific doses to run at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">peak efficiency</a>. So what, pray tell, does a supernatural or alien being require to operate at its normal, <em>super</em> human efficiency? Why, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan">humans</a>!
</p><p>These creatures don't just need to feed on humans to get their powers or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhoYouEat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhoYouEat">keep a human shape</a>, but very likely to survive. And to make matters worse, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">humanitarian diet</a> comes with a relentless, insatiable, and ultimately irresistible hunger. This is the driving force behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">a lot</a> of the evil in supernatural creatures. The Horror Hunger can only be sated by feeding on (parts of) other humans; (non-human) animals are rarely a viable substitute, and if they do work, they taste horrible. These are not your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampires">Friendly Neighborhood Vampires</a>.

If they're being starved by enemies like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters">Hunter of Monsters</a>, this is an incredibly effective and cruel torture.

Even in cases where the supernaturals don't <em>need</em> to consume humans to survive, the Horror Hunger creates conflict and provides an explanation for why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampires">Friendly Neighborhood Vampires</a> find it so hard to quit.

Even if it's a hunger for something that doesn't harm humans directly, it can still be extremely dangerous. Perhaps feeding somehow damages <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream">the environment</a>, the addictive elements and danger of death are still present, and/or it likely causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>.

<ul><li> Vampires and Zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, as seen in the page image. Upon being newly turned by the Stone Mask, they emerge as shriveled, decayed husks, which regain their strength and vigor upon drinking a human's blood (unlike traditional vampires, they drink <em>with their fingers</em>.)
<ul><li> Horrifically displayed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">Part 1</a> when a woman pleads to Dio to spare her child, and take her in its place. Dio swears on his honor that he will not harm the baby...and then <em>he turns the mother into a zombie</em>, who then proceeds to devour her own child, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Dio technically keeping his end of the bargain.</a>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Part 3</a>, a resurrected Dio resurfaces 100 years later, now having taken Jonathan's body as his own. However, the fusion is imperfect, and he seeks out Joestar blood to attain his full power. Sure enough, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> seemingly</span> killing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Joseph</span> and drinking his blood, he becomes much more powerful and far more unhinged, <em>jabbing his finger right into his own skull</em> while laughing maniacally, cackling how <em>Joestar blood is the greatest HIGH!</em>
</li></ul></li><li> When souls become Hollows in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, they are driven by an eternal and insatiable hunger to devour other souls, living or dead. However, when the void within an ordinary hollow's heart becomes so much that human souls are incapable of sustaining it, the hollows are driven to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodChainOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodChainOfEvil">cannibalize other fellow hollows.</a> This usually results in the evolution of a bigger, stronger hollow. The only way to stop the hunger is to either a) become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishonenLine">Vasto Lorde</a>, the most powerful Hollow type that can take centuries to get to, or b) remove your mask and become an Arrancar, gaining an increase in power and Shinigami-esque powers (and even THAT form is only practical if they make it to Adjuchas-level first, the one right below Vasto Lorde).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">Philosopher's Stones</a>, the Homunculi's power source, are easy for them to get, they tend to take heavy damage to the point where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pride devours Gluttony in order to stave off Ed and Greed</span>.
<ul><li> A similar case occurs in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a>; when Homunculi are injured, they start losing their human appearance and power and develop a ravenous hunger for red stones. It doesn't seem to actually be necessary and before they've had any, they don't even want it. This is perhaps played most horrifyingly straight with Wrath, who is given some red stones by Envy to eat like candy, and is horrified when Envy tells him that the stones are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> made of human lives</span>, but can't resist chowing down on them again immediately after.
</li></ul></li><li> The Shadow Angels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisOfAquarion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisOfAquarion">Genesis of Aquarion</a></em> must harvest human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a> to survive.
</li><li> In <em>Animerica</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Kiyone</a> has an insatiable appetite for human blood and occasionally <em>flesh</em>. In fact, Lita recalls a moment where she caught him VORACIOUSLY eating what appears to be a <em>torn carcass</em>.
</li><li> Homunculi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em> are, as a rule, required to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">eat human beings</a> in order to live. Victor, the sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series, takes this a step further. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland">unconsciously drains the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland">of everything around him</a>. Plants, animals, people, <em>everything</em>. For him, feeding in this manner is the same as breathing. Directly after Victor's introduction, it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Kazuki</a></span> is slowly becoming like Victor and will be subjected to this same Horror Hunger.
<ul><li> Worthy of note is that, after his initial frenzy of devouring his family/servants, Papillion never needs to eat again. Eventually, another homunculus determines that the hunger is out of a desire to become human again - which Papillion (who made <em>himself</em> into a homunculus) doesn't have.

</li><li> The titular Parasites in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Parasyte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Parasyte">Parasyte</a></em> are driven by a primal urge to kill and eat the kind of whatever species they possess (a Parasite that took over the head of a dog kills and eats another dog). Averted with Migi and Jaw, who live on otherwise normal human hosts rather than replacing their heads; they take the nutrients they need straight from their bloodstream and don't have the same killing instinct.

Carnivorous animals suffer from a hunger for the flesh of herbivores, which in severe cases can cause insanity, even in carnivores who have never eaten meat. Eating meat is treated as both a metaphor for drug usage and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsumingPassion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsumingPassion">sex</a>. Many carnivores choose to indulge themselves by buying herbivore meat from the blackmarket, which mostly, but not entirely, comes from herbivores who died of natural causes. Protagonist Legosi the wolf refuses to eat meat and has a lot of relationship difficulties with Haru the rabbit because he isn't entirely sure if his feelings for her are actually romantic or just confused instincts to eat her, which he almost did when he first met her. And even after he becomes certain that he really is in love with her, they still have a lot of difficulty with intimacy due to their instincts. To get rid of his meat cravings, he trains by exposing himself to meat without eating it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And his cravings comes back when his friend Louis has him eat his foot to restore his strength during his fight with the predator who ate Tem.</span>

When she <em>doesn't</em> have blood to drink, she can become mad from the starvation to the point of turning downright feral. She might well have been put down by humans before she turned six had Minami not realized this and made sure she could be provided with blood to drink. When Lizette accidentally runs out of blood packs, she finds Chiharu's scent almost irresistible and has to keep herself from attacking Chiharu. That chapter ends with Lizette going to pick up her blood rather than wait for it to be delivered and swearing to never run out like that again.

The process is almost always fatal to those she's stealing heat from. She learns to control it in <em>DC Universe Rebirth</em> so that it doesn't kill the victim, but the hunger is definitely still there.
</li><li> <em>Dead High: Yearbook</em>: An anthology of horror stories about typical teenagers who are thrown into not-so-typical situations. In one story a limp-noodle of a boy and a fat, ostracized girl take experimental drugs that end up giving the boy muscles and make the girl lose weight rapidly. However, with each passing day, the drugs work too well: the girl keeps getting thinner and thinner no matter how much she eats and is constantly hungry (and rumors start that she's bulimic, so she's just as ostracized as she was when she was fat), and the boy's muscles keep growing to the point that he is hardly able to move and unable to control his anger. In the end, unable to control her hunger anymore, the now anorexic girl transforms (via body horror) into a giant, tapeworm-like creature that proceeds to eat the guy before his muscles make him explode.
</li><li> The zombie superheroes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies">Marvel Zombies</a></em> often refer to the Hunger as something that controls them.

Unlike most members of his species, he was morally averse to feeding on sentient beings, so only fed on nonsentient beings (like plants) - on one occasion where he was forced to "eat" a villain to save his teammates, he actually threw up the consumed life energy on principle.
<ul><li> The Phalanx, an offshoot of the Technarchy, have the same need to infect others with the Transmode virus, which is how Warlock and his race prepare their food for consumption. Unlike the Technarchy, they don't proceed to eat their victims - the infection is more about adding to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> Collective. The Technarchy are disgusted by the Phalanx since the Phalanx are essentially <em>fungus growing on spoiled food</em> to them.
</li></ul></li><li> An early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em> story featured a "famine demon" who would cause people to develop an insane hunger— not just for food and drugs but things they desired like <em>clothing and jewelry</em>. One memorable moment has a bodybuilder suddenly sink his teeth into the biceps he was just admiring. The source of the demon was eventually discovered to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of John's old bandmates, who was a drug addict. In order to contain the demon, John and Papa Midnite had to seal him into a wall — <em>alive</em>.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> This condition afflicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Venom</a>. He <em>swallows people whole.</em> He once did this to a <em>horse,</em> complete with rider.

<ul><li> Less so with main Marvelverse <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Venom">Venom</a></em>. While main Venom <em>does</em> require a chemical compound found in few locations outside of the human brain to survive, and he begins getting <em>cravings</em> if he goes too long without it, one of the few other locations the compound can be found is chocolate. Yes, a Horror Hunger for either brains... <em>or chocolate</em>. Either one works.
</li><li> Ultimate Carnage is even worse: he assimilates people's DNA to try to complete himself, the process of which leaves them drained, skeletal husks. Because a writer got the two mixed up, the main universe Carnage also displayed this trait once—or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">so we're told</a>; it mostly just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">served to make Luke Cage look tough</a> by easily resisting it.

To ease her conscience, she limits herself to eating the alien microbes and bioweapons that appear with alarming frequency on Earth since they don't belong there anyway. However, this isn't nearly enough to satisfy her hunger pangs which are almost as strong as her father's (who has to eat <em>entire planets</em> to briefly satisfy his hunger). She spends every moment of every day on Earth searching for more alien food while resisting the temptation to gorge herself on the literal tons of food surrounding her. Then she discovers a "Tapeworm Cosmic" parasite inside her feeding off of her power and exacerbating her hunger. She gets so desperate she briefly considers creating a planet to eat from scratch using Wolverine's DNA as a template to give it a regeneration factor. Galacta doesn't go through with it; reasoning that it would be way too immoral to create an entire world just to use it as a buffet. In the end, she is driven to use the Ultimate Nullifier on herself in an attempt to destroy the Tapeworm, knowing and not caring in the least that this could destroy her as well (the Nullifier is one of the few things in existence that can kill beings like Galactus and Galacta). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Galactus saves both Galli and the Tapeworm because the "Tapeworm" isn't really a parasite: it's the larval form of beings such as Galactus and Galacta.

He chews on a pencil, and then a girl takes advantage of Shoda's psychological troubles for fun by showing him a picture of a watermelon slice, making Shoda hallucinate it is an actual watermelon slice. The teacher kicks him out of class and spotting a picture of a steak dinner from a wall display of the student's art drawings, Shoda rips it off to eat it but the picture's artist, Ayumi (played by Aki Maeda), the girl who has a crush on him, defends the drawing and sweetly pleads him to spare it but Shoda out of hunger tries to bite her arm, causing her to run away and get lost in frightening, confusing illusions.

Unfortunately, the species on the receiving end of this arrangement rebelled and rose up against the 'vampires', massacring most of them and exiling the surviving remnant from their world. Jez <em>hates</em> having the driving need to ingest blood regularly or die, as she feels it makes the remaining Mixitors social outcasts.

He can't control it very well, so they either die or "burn out", which is implied to be worse. The hunger is described as being ravenous and directly connected to his empathic ability, and even when he feeds it, it's never really quiet. He tries to feed only on the attack junkies and rapists of New York, preying on the predators, but the hunger doesn't distinguish between these people and their victims, and he knows he won't be able to do this for long before he loses control. At the end of the book, after helping the heroes take out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> whose side he started on, he commits suicide.

If someone nearby is bleeding, they're almost incapable of resisting the urge to attack, a fact that can be used against them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>, Harry Dresden's incubus half-brother, Thomas, once gave a vivid demonstration of what resisting his own inborn Horror Hunger (desire/life force) is like. After racing Harry along the beach long enough that both were sweaty and overheated, and <em>very</em> thirsty, he knocked Harry's water bottle out of his hand the second a drop of water touched his lips.

</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress">Night Huntress</a></em> series, newly turned vampires can think of nothing but their hunger and will shred anything with a heartbeat to sate their thirst. As they age, they gain self-control, but a starved vampire may revert to this condition. Throughout the series, several characters are shown just starved enough to lose control, but aware enough to be horrified by themselves as their friends try to restrain them.
</li><li> The hunger itself is described in excruciating detail on several occasions in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OlegDivov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OlegDivov">Oleg Divov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatcher">Night Watcher</a></em> (it's a vampire novel, so that's par for course of course). Every vampire eventually either manages to beat the addiction and transcend to a new evolutionary level or become a hideous degenerated mindless monster that hunts in packs (it's both more and less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> than it sounds, and is pretty self-conscious about it).
</li><li> While it's not actually necessary for their survival, the carnivorous impulses of werewolves in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a></em> series can get out of control if they're in the presence of blood or fresh meat. It's considered remarkable that one of the lead characters manages to work as a physician because other surgeons or veterinarians who become werewolves don't dare interact with injured humans or animals, lest their appetites get the better of them.

<ul><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> find humans - primarily their minds and souls - crunchy and good with ketchup. In fact, that's generally why the Earth is interesting to them in the first place. However, their insatiable hunger tends to make them <em>less</em> dangerous, as they tend to ignore anything past immediate feeding. And if a lesser predatory spirit is bound to a human, its host must periodically kill to feed it.
</li><li> When vampires show up in the series, this is the reason they're so rare. Becoming a vampire is the result of an eldritch parasite locking on to your brain due to spellcasting via the performance of complex algorithms; feeding on a human effectively opens them up to this parasite, and the human will die of a neurodegenerative disease in the space of a month. Most vampires meet the sunrise when they realize this. The ones attached to the Laundry are freaked out when they learn the truth, and the only reason they're kept around is because having immortal beings with an affinity for sorcery and necromancy who are resistant to the brain-eating effects of these practices outweighs the moral difficulties, especially with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN</a> approaching.

</li><li> An intriguing variation occurs in the Zenna Henderson short story "Food to All Flesh": a Catholic priest in a rural parish witnesses a landing spaceship which contains a single, utterly alien occupant which is quickly revealed to be both peaceful and extremely hungry. When the priest deduces that the alien is in the process of giving birth and desperately needs to feed its young, he endeavors to find something the creature can eat, but nothing is palatable. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Until one of the newborn aliens takes a bite out of his arm... and contentedly swallows.

Peter tries to saw open Future Nathan's skull to better understand his thought process and attempts to do the same thing to Angela when he gets back to the present so he will know her secrets.

<ul><li> Furthermore, some books mention the risk of developing the "Elder's Thirst," under which no blood will sustain an elder vampire — well, save for that of younger vampires...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasqueradeFifthEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasqueradeFifthEdition">Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition</a></em> has tweaked this so that hunger is more prevalent. The only way a vampire can ever truly slake the Beast for any period of time is if they kill while feeding; if not, they will always have one degree of Hunger, which brings with it the risk of losing control.

<ul><li> At the outset, vampires' hunger for blood can drive them into an animalistic frenzy, making it quite risky to be blood-starved in public when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmBloodbagsAreEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmBloodbagsAreEverywhere">Warm Bloodbags Are Everywhere</a>; it gets worse when their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">Blood Potency</a> rises to the point that they have to target humans because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire">feeding on animals</a> no longer satisfies them.
</li><li> Ancient or exceptionally powerful vampires can only gain sustenance from the blood of other vampires, which is seen as horrific even in undead society. At that point, resting in Torpor for a few decades until their blood weakens to manageable levels is usually the best option, though some learn how to direct their Horror hunger at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodChainOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodChainOfEvil">other supernatural entities instead</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> by the Ordo Dracul, a vampiric research organization: they have developed techniques to neutralize the Horror Hunger, last longer without blood, and remain able to feed on animals indefinitely.

Over a period of weeks, it transforms the carrier into an inhuman monster with an uncontrollable desire for human flesh.
<ul><li> The same sourcebook also has the Aswang (an even nastier array of which showed up in the "Wicked Dead" splatbook for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em>), who crave human blood, and a supernatural entity called The Thief, which hungers to devour key organs (such as hearts from vampires) of any supernatural creature it encounters.
</li></ul></li><li> Cannibalistic urges can also appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em>, most often among those of the Ogre and Beast seemings.

This is generally just played as part of their antagonist status, but in the last book, <em>Saturnine Night</em>, a Sublimatus (sentient Pandoran) is introduced who manages to snap into lucidity on occasion, and outright <em>weeps</em> at how the Prometheans he feeds on have the chance to redeem themselves and become human... and <em>he</em> never will. He's damned to be hungry for the rest of time.
</li><li> The Beasts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BeastThePrimordial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BeastThePrimordial">Beast: The Primordial</a></em> take this trope to a literal extreme, in that they have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a> <em>for</em> Horror. Beasts are sapient nightmares made mortal, and as such, they have a physical and mental need to feed on fear and despair. The precise flavor of fear they hunger for is one of their defining aspects, whilst the kind of fear they embody is the other.
<ul><li> And if a Beast doesn't feed often enough, whether due to lack of opportunity or moral compunctions (some Hungers require things like stealing or even killing) their Soul rebels and starts giving the neighbors horrific nightmares so it feeds anyways. Unfortunately, that method has a higher than normal chance of creating Heroes obsessed with slaying Beasts.

Minimum survival diet: one human, elf, drow, or svirfneblin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood">brain</a> per month. <em>Optimal</em> diet: one human, elf, drow, or svirfneblin brain per <em>week</em>. Some sources indicate that mind flayers <em>can</em> be sated with the brains of animals like deer. The problem is that the more sapient the creature, the more filling it is — a mind flayer might need to eat several deer brains <em>a day</em> to remain as satiated as they'd have been on a human brain a week. This is obviously not very practical, especially not in the Underdark.
</li><li> Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV) sufferers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>, depending on their strain, need to either constantly drain living metahumans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Essence</a> (which counts in-game as an addiction) or eat metahuman flesh for sustenance (which doesn't, beyond how we're all addicted to having to eat). Either way, it usually leads to this, though in theory it's possible for the second type to survive without harming anyone (by eating medical waste and raiding cemeteries). Most sufferers aren't that lucky, however. One group of ghouls in Chicago discovered that, while they tasted disgusting, Insect Spirits were apparently close enough to humans that they could survive by eating them and went into the extermination business.
</li><li> Ghouls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em> have the same problem.
<ul><li> Any flesh will do, and they prefer it pre-rotten. Human cemeteries just happen to be easy pickings, but they prefer giant Gugs from the Dreamlands' Underworld if they can get away with it.
</li></ul></li><li> Every other monster in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em> has a Horror Hunger, which even led to eventual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a>: "Oh, and it has a taste for human flesh. But what doesn't these days?"
<ul><li> Harrowed have a drawback unique to them, Unnatural Appetite, that afflicts them with this in varying severities. At first level, it's gross but harmless; stuff like rotten food and mold. At fifth level, you need stuff like raw human organs (either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickyPeopleEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickyPeopleEater">one specific kind</a> or in general). Harrowed also need to eat raw meat (human or animal) on a fairly regular basis anyway, to be able to heal themselves.

They exude a pheromone which thri-kreen find hard to resist... especially if the elf is frightened or running! (In that setting, elves are fast, but thri-kreen are usually faster.) As a result, slavers know to never put a thri-kreen and elf in the same cage. Shame when a PC thri-kreen and elf have to work together. Not surprisingly, there was a kit called Thri-kreen Slayer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> can only stay within Creation when powered by virtue, in the sense that they can consume it, often permanently, to stave away Creation's attempt to define their fundamentally false and chaotic natures into stasis. They can get around this requirement by staying in areas soaking with the Wyld or with natural motes, by wearing pendants created by such places converted to their cause, or by only 'gently' feeding on the breadcrumbs of emotions spent in minor squabbles and keeping their power consumption down. The vast majority, however, just nom human minds away until their victims have less personality than the average <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> robot.

They don't <em>have</em> to literally drink blood after every fight, but they'll complain if they're stopped from doing so.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Yozi</a> Metagaos is chiefly motivated by an eternal hunger that can never be sated no matter how much he devours. We can perhaps consider the lack of official Metagaos charms released so far to be a <em>good</em> thing since Infernals become more like their patrons as they learn their powers...
</li></ul></li><li> Dark Eldar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> are cursed to have their soul slowly drained by the Chaos God Slaanesh, and must replenish it by feeding on pain and suffering. Doing so rejuvenates them, so a Dark Eldar could theoretically live forever, provided they have access to a steady supply of victims. However, the hunger grows with age, so the oldest Dark Eldar Archons have thousands of slaves sacrificed for them every day, and even that isn't enough to rejuvenate them, but merely keep them alive. Presumably, eventually they'll hit the point where they will metaphysically starve faster than they can feed.
<ul><li> This is less a curse and more a side-effect of living in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack City</a>. Dark Eldar who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">leave Commorragh</a> to go live with their less evil cousins no longer need pain to survive. This is extremely rare.
<ul><li> It's not so much living in Comorragh (indeed, staying in the Webway actually decreases the speed at which their souls drain), as it is the lifestyle. Dark Eldar adopting the way of life of their Craftworlder or Exodite cousins (which involves denying themselves of excessive emotion through a strict and regimentalized way of life) don't seem to suffer from the Thirst, while Craftworld outcasts that adopt the Dark Eldar way of life eventually develop it. This makes sense: when trying to avoid the grip of a soul-devouring god of hedonism, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">the worst thing you can do is to act like a hedonist.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The Necron Flayed Ones are Necrons cursed by the C'tan with the Flayer Virus, a program error where they develop a desire to reclaim their flesh and blood existence by devouring the flesh of the living. And since they don't have any kind of digestive system, the eaten flesh just falls down through their ribcages.
</li></ul></li><li> The Skaven from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> suffer from the Black Hunger, a ravenous hunger that strikes them after a period of exertion due to their metabolism. This causes Skaven to go mad with hunger as they began trying to devour whatever food they can find. It's not uncommon for them to immediately began gorging themselves on the battlefield dead after a fight. Being that food is often scarce in the Under-Empire, this means cannibalism is simply a matter of course, and many slaves meet their end to satiate their betters. It also defines their entire worldview and culture, since the very first thing a Skaven feels upon being born is the gnawing pangs of the Black Hunger, and they will do <strong>anything</strong> to stave it off. Unsurprisingly, Skaven pups are very quick to start eating their littermates. In fact, being the sole survivor of a litter because you <em>ate all your siblings</em> is seen as a sign of future greatness among the ratmen.

White Court, who are (barely) usable as PCs, suffer hits depending on how often they use their powers, while the other types suffer it all the time. If they don't have enough, they could die — or, far more likely, they could snap and kill the nearest person to feed on them. (Ghouls also have a Hunger track, but theirs is for raw meat.)

Until this is done, the morphworm reverts to a primal, instinct-driven beast seeking nothing more than to feed, and becomes unable to view humanoids or large mammals, even its friends as allies, as more than food. This is an issue for morphworms seeking to live in civilized society as, although they do not wish to eat their allies and regret their actions after feeding, they can do nothing to stop themselves once their hunger rises.

While their attempt to resist the hunger is somewhat heartwarming, both cases end badly; Jinana is driven to a hopeless frenzy after a brutal beating by Mick the Slug, and Lupa ultimately succumbs to the hunger after traversing the Svadhisthana Waterways.

Should the flow of Light ever be interrupted, the worm symbiote would instead begin feeding on their host. In order to get around this and further their endless crusade of wreaking death upon the rest of the universe for being too weak to oppose them, the Hive gods came up with a system of tribute, where lesser Hive creatures would take the Light from those they killed and keep enough to let them feed their own parasites and grow and become more powerful, and supply the leftover Light to their immediate superiors. These greater Hive entities would do the same, passing it up the chain until the tribute of Light reached the Hive gods, which would be fed to their symbiotes. During the "King's Fall" raid, the player Guardians take advantage of this by locating Oryx's tribute of corrupted Light and releasing it, leaving the Hive god suddenly starving and vulnerable to attack.

<ul><li> The mental disease known as Pica causes people to uncontrollably eat things that are not conventionally considered edible. Dirt, sand, paper, wood, stones, rusty nails, hair... Depending on the severity of the disorder and developmental level of the afflicted individual, they may be completely aware that their behaviour is insane but unable to stop themselves, sometimes to the point of requiring physical restraints. An even more severe form of Pica is Autophagia, which is all of the above except with the compulsion to bite off and consume chunks of your <em>own flesh.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> Richard Chase was delusional enough to believe that if he didn't eat people's organs and drink their blood, he would die.
</li><li> Shrews, small, rat-like mammals related to moles and hedgehogs, are constantly in a state of perpetual starvation due to their high metabolisms, and are known to eat more than their own body weight each day! Despite their tiny sizes, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">vicious predators</a>, and will indiscriminately devour any small animal in their way, be it insects, spiders or even small mammals and even other shrews! Their metabolism is so hyperactive, that they will <em>literally starve to death</em> if they don't eat for as little as <em>three hours.</em>
<ul><li> Most small animals, such as hummingbirds, rodents, and fast-swimming pelagic fish, also have similarly hypercharged metabolic rates and must continue feeding constantly or else they'll quickly starve in a matter of hours.
</li></ul></li><li> An actual real-life version of this trope occurs for those who suffer from the genetic disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome, where the defining behavioral symptom after the first year of life is an insatiable and endless hunger that can never be satisfied no matter how much the person eats due to a defect in their genes that disables the areas in the brain responsible for feelings of fullness. Left unsupervised, people with Prader-Willi syndrome may eat until their stomachs tear.
</li><li> Wendigo psychosis is a culture-bound syndrome that manifests as an intense craving for human flesh and a constant fear that the sufferer will turn into a cannibal.
</li><li> A much more benign version of this occurs in bears during the autumn months — they experience a shift in their metabolism called hyperphagia, which allows them to keep eating without ever feeling full. Justified as this is the last part of the year they have to pile on the pounds before going to sleep for the winter. And fortunately for humans, people are very rarely on the menu, with salmon and other migrating fish being their preferred prey.
</li><li> Cannibalism outside of survival situations or cultural rituals is widely believed to be addictive for a number of overlapping reasons, most of which are connected to psychosis, psychopathy, or sexual fantasies involving the consumption of human flesh. In the last case at least, acting out these fantasies causes a flood of dopamine in the brain, leading the subject to repeat this behavior to get the rush again.
