</p><p>If the change in time flow is constant, then the hero may save the day in the other world and jump back to their home dimension for a short while, then return... only to find centuries have passed.

<ul><li> The entire plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em>. The main characters duel in a full-dive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace">virtual world</a> where time is sped up by a factor of 1000. If you lose, you lose Points, if you win you gain them, and if you lose all of them the game deinstalls <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and you lose every memory related to it</span>. It takes ten Points to enter the Unlimited Field, where you can fight NPCs and basically stay as long as you want (since 45 minutes in real life equals about a month in-game). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">The time the veterans have spent there is unknown, but it's unlikely to be less than a couple of decades.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angelique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angelique">Angélique</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with in the manga version of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angelique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angelique">Angélique</a></em> where in one chapter, the heroine has to select a priest to deliver her message to the people of the continent she is cultivating. Due to the difference in the flow of time between the Sanctuary and said continent, she meets her choice as a child one day and then as an adult the next, causing her a great deal of confusion.
</li><li> The actual amount of time that passes in the Holy Land/Sanctuary vs the rest of the universe is incredibly wonky and often contradicts itself if it means letting a main character live. For example, in <em>Koi suru Tenshi Angelique</em>, it's mentioned that one year in the Shinchou universe's Sanctuary equals several decades outside. If that's the case, than a lot of the Seijuu universe's guardians would have probably died of old age before Ange got to them (and they probably wouldn't have shown up in multiple games after their debuts that probably take place months apart time wise.)
</li></ul></li><li> Downplayed in New World Online the VRMMORPG of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BofuriIDontWantToGetHurtSoIllMaxOutMyDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BofuriIDontWantToGetHurtSoIllMaxOutMyDefense">BOFURI: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense</a></em> one week within the virtual world is two hours in the real world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> The pathway from the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Human world to Soul Society</span> acts like this. You usually couldn't stay there for too long before an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> comes and sucks you into another time (or just wipes you from existence) but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after it was gone Isshin is able to extend the time difference even longer so that an hour outside would turn into <em>2000 hours</em> inside.</span>
</li><li> Also, Yukio's Fullbring, Invaders Must Die, has a fast forward mode that allows an indeterminate amount of training to take place in a few hours. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However much it is, it's enough to let Ichigo finish his Fullbring training.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrimsonSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrimsonSpell">Crimson Spell</a></em>, Halvir spends three <em>months</em> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a> before he even bothers to get around investigating what exactly is going on - and then a little longer to indulge in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinThreesomeFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinThreesomeFantasy">Twin Threesome Fantasy</a> once he's figured it out - after which the events of the main storyline resume with no apparent interruption.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>, the Digital World works on a one day = one minute ratio. However, when it is reformatted at the end of the season, it and the real world begin working in the same time frame, allowing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> kids to treat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveBothWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveBothWorlds">saving both worlds</a> as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpGoToSchoolSaveTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpGoToSchoolSaveTheWorld">after-school activity</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em> also features a time discrepancy: comparing the first and last episodes indicates that no more than ten minutes elapsed in the real world compared to months in the Digital World. However, in one episode Takuya somehow goes back in time to before he went to the Digital World, implying that the relationship between Real World time and Digital World time is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">more complicated than it appears</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em>, virtually no time had passed from the point our three heroes entered the Digital World to their return to the Real World mid-season.
</li></ul></li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> movie had Doraemon's magical doorway lead into another world; relativistic effects made it so that one day in the other world was nothing more than an hour on Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Hyperbolic Time Chamber, known as the Room of Spirit and Time in Japanese, is introduced during the Android arc. It's an alternate dimension accessed from Kami's Lookout, and one day outside equals one year inside. It allows our heroes to get some much-needed training they otherwise wouldn't have time for. Later on, during the Buu arc, Piccolo exploits this trope by having Trunks and Goten practice the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a> in the Time Chamber while he stalls Buu outside; even if he can't keep Buu busy for more than a few minutes, that still gives Goten and Trunks hours of practice time.
</li><li> The Room reappears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> when, in preparation for an inter-universal combat tournament, Goku and Vegeta spend three years/days inside training.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, time inside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GateOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GateOfTruth">Gate of Truth</a> appears to take no time at all outside; at least when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alphonse sacrifices himself to restore Edward's arm, he has a short conversation with his body first, while Edward's battle with Father seems to have stood still.</span>
<ul><li> The exact nature of the Gate is mysterious. It almost seems to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceBeyondTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceBeyondTime">Place Beyond Time</a>, except that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alphonse's body ages while it's in there. At the same rate as it would have aged in the real world, despite time not usually seeming to pass in the Gate relative to the outside. Alphonse's body seemed to be linked to the physical plane via Edward, so perhaps that connection made it age normally. It also explains why the body didn't starve to death, as Edward eats and sleeps a lot and the characters theorize some of that was transferred to Alphonse's body.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em>
<ul><li> An interesting variant because all of the events of the Universe of the Four Gods take place in a book. Anything that occurs in the book only takes about as much time in the real world as it would take for someone to read about it.
</li><li> The second part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a></em>, focusing on Miaka and Taka searching for the stones containing his memories as Tamahome, plays with it by having Suzaku-Seikun inhabit Miaka's watch and send them into the original scroll of the Universe. With him in her watch, he only lets them stay in the scroll for as long as it takes for one hour to pass in the real world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This bites them in the back when he transfers into her pager and has no reminder anymore when an hour has passed. Miaka ends up in the scroll for two days, but was gone for <em>three months</em> in the real world.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em>, Mepple leaves the Garden of Light one day after Mipple does. This translates into about a century in the Garden of Rainbows (i.e. on Earth). When Nagisa and Honoka go to the Garden of Light themselves, the effect ends up being reversed (about a day in the Garden of Light becomes no time at all in the Garden of Rainbows) due to Porun's assistance. In one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">movies</a>, the Garden of Hope seems to work this way on its own, with the entire movie (appearing to take quite a bit of time, possibly even multiple days) happening within just a few minutes.

A month lasts two hours, a year, two days. (This is made clear in the movie as well. David and Jennifer are clearly there for some time but when David returns to the real world the TV says that the <em>Pleasantville</em> marathon has been on for an hour.) Specifically, it appears David was in Pleasantville for at least four months while exactly one hour passed back home. (They arrive in April 1958, and he leaves just after seeing Jennifer off to college, meaning it's probably August in Pleasantville.)

<ul><li> Although not referenced directly in the first film, Jeff Bridges spends what seems to be several days inside the computer world, only to emerge on the same night that he left. It's unknown how long this was in the real world, but it was long enough for Alan to go to his computer and upload a file to Tron.
</li><li> It's pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">confirmed in the video game sequels</a>; there's a part in the Game Boy Advance game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh">TRON 2.0: Killer App</a></em> where a program named Mercury asks an older program called FAT2NE to decrypt a crucial data file.

</li><li> In the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy">TRON: Legacy</a></em>, it's confirmed that time passes 50 times faster in the computer world. So while Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) has been missing in the real world for 20 years, he has lived 1000 years in the computer world.
</li><li> In the first film during the Solar Sailer/Recognizer encounter, Yuri claims the next beam is a few nanoseconds away; in context, this is understood as meaning minutes (not a long amount of time but too long to wait in an emergency), thus leading to Flynn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">reveal as a user</a>. Since Flynn's chair never fell over, it can be assumed that he was on the grid less than 1 second, since the timescale of 1 real world second = 1 billion Grid minutes = <em>~1900 subjective years</em> for Flynn. The 20 years in the sequel is even worse.

They go from a pre-industrial civilization to having explored the galaxy with FTL starships in <em>twelve hours</em>. This plot was later loosely adapted into an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>.

The girl is away for considerably longer, and when she's about to be returned the protagonist briefly worries about how old <em>she'll</em> be, but in the end she's aged about as much as her brother. The story allows for several possible explanations, including that she was in suspended animation for most of the time after her brother escaped, or that the passage of time in the fairy realm doesn't have a direct relationship to the passage of time in the normal world. Another hint that it's not a simple case of "time passes quicker there" is that when the boy returns he's lost a tooth and is growing another, which the examining doctor notes is normal for a boy the age he was when he disappeared but unheard-of in a man the age he now appears.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNumberOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNumberOfTheBeast">The Number of the Beast</a></em>, a universe spanning device also allows you to visit universes which experience time on an axis 90 degrees to our own. This means you can spend any amount of time there and no time will pass in your own universe. Unusually for this trope, the main characters' first idea when this ability is discovered is that they could make a business off it.

However Cabal is so unafraid of Rufus that he mocks him and lets him chant a spell that eventually (while Cabal waits, taunts and sneezes) tosses Cabal into a pocket dimension. The place, known only as the Garden, seems to have no time, or death, though to Cabal he's there for a few minutes at least (which is more or less meaningless in a world without time-until he makes some) but when he comes back its noted in the narration that he's been gone-to the outside world-for thirty seconds.
</li><li> The House in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KeysToTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KeysToTheKingdom">Keys to the Kingdom</a></em> series runs awfully conveniently. Each of the Trustees can only affect the real world on their day of the week. The main character may spend several months, or slightly over a day, in a single section of the House, but less than a day will elapse in the "Outer Realms". So with luck, he's going to take control of the entire universe in a <em>week</em>. The convenience in the time of the outer realms starts going out of whack in the fourth book — half a day has passed while the protagonists were in the house, and in the fifth book, it is revealed that Arthur has now spent a week in the House during the time passed in the fourth book.

The game experiences time as flowing four times as fast. So while the game has only been released for a year after the story's introduction is done, the game itself has had four real years. This becomes more important as a media group is trying to edit footage from the game, and is unable to keep up with the "live" footage, having to frequently fast forward.

Another team went, reported the world safe for colonization ... and didn't come back afterward. Colonists went ... and then all contact was lost. The Consensus sent three massive fleets to investigate, one after the other, and each vanished. Then the Consensus got serious and sent protagonist Nils Hansen. This all occurred over the course of a few years. For the explorers, colonists, and fleet crews (or their descendants), it's been roughly ten <em>thousand</em> years. Also, Northworld consists of nine interlinked universes — and time spent in one world has no relation to the passage of time in another: you could transfer out of one universe as a bullet flies toward you, spend <em>years</em> flitting about the other eight, and finally return to the first while the bullet is still in flight.

The groom refuses and winds up spending 35 years inside the timeless void of the box, remaining young while his bride becomes a crazy old woman.
</li><li> In "The Guests", an idealistic young drifter becomes trapped in a mansion which has been taken over by an alien brain who is studying humanity. Time doesn't pass inside the house, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoImmortalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoImmortalInertia">No Immortal Inertia</a> means the other people confined within (who have all been there for decades) <em>can't</em> leave.

<ul><li> In "Rimmerworld", the escape pod Rimmer was in ended up flying into a wormhole, which made it seem like he was on a planet for 600 years, while to the rest of crew it takes 6 hours to find him.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> dealt with a village that was encased in a time bubble inside which time moved much faster. A character in his 30s who had been missing for a few weeks turned out to be trapped in the village and had aged about 40 years. Because the sun wasn't inside the bubble, days and nights each lasted years. The bubble is also expanding, and if encompasses the entire world, the Earth will tear itself apart. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When they do close it, everyone who was born inside the bubble ceases to exist.</span>

And they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">undid those 3 at the end</a>, too.</span>
</li><li> An interesting take on this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, where Sheppard gets stuck inside a time dilation field where time goes much faster than outside. When his team eventually understands what's going on, he has practically starved to death on the inside. This leads to a race against time for his team to get to him during his lifetime. They get him out in 6 months (by his reckoning)
<div class="indent"><strong>Sheppard:</strong> Never thought I'd see any of you again. Kind of even missed you a little. <br/><strong>Ronon:</strong> Yeah, well, it was only a couple of hours for us, so <br/><strong>Teyla:</strong> Ronon!

<ul><li> One episode ("Blink of an Eye") has <em>Voyager</em> fall into the gravity well of an enormous M-Class planet, the gravity and spin of which causes centuries to pass down on the planet's surface in only a matter of hours on the ship. Curiously, it's also one of the rare examples that examines the physical hazards to transversing such time dilations; when a group of astronauts from the planet manage to hook up to <em>Voyager</em>, the stresses in the transition between their time bubble and that of regular space killed one of them and severely injured the other. A subplot involves the Doctor, a timeless, mobile computer program, going down to the planet for what's supposed to be a few seconds (a few days planet-time), only for the transporter to malfunction as they attempt to bring him back up, leaving him stranded for several hours ship-time. In planet-time, this is enough to make a life and <em>family</em> for himself. How in God's name a hologram fathered a son is quickly lampshaded and handwaved as "a long story".

On this world however, serving your time consists only of having artificial memories of experiencing it inserted into your mind; thus, he serves what seems to him a decades long sentence and then awakes to find only an hour or so had passed. This is made much worse by artifical memories of a cell mate; by necessity, O'Brien had befriended the false man.
</li><li> In "Playing God," a small proto-universe is created inside the station. The crew quickly figure a way to destroy it only for Dax to find evidence life exists inside it. Kira is dubious there could be intelligent life after only a few hours of its creation. Bashir points out they have no idea how time passes in this proto-universe and thus, billions of years could have gone by already. The idea of slaying countless innocent beings means the crew have to find a new way to handle this proto-universe before it destroys them.

An abducted human could spend two hours in Faerie, only to find that ten years have passed on Earth... or they could spend ten years in Faerie, only to find that two hours have passed on Earth.
<ul><li> Theres also the fact that it has no logic or reason to it that a human would understand, meaning that the relative time flow could be <em>anything</em>. And we really do mean <em>anything</em>. The ratio could be something like an hour outside for the colour blue inside.

Since they are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWorld">Dream World</a>, time is subjective to the one experiencing it. The amount of real time that passes largely depends on the degree to which the Astral traveller interacts with the Realm. For example, if one simply passes through a desert, it will <em>seem</em> to take hours, but in real time it will take as long as it takes to say "I pass through the desert". Its noted that in some of the deeper parts of the Astral, a person can take journeys which subjectively take years, or even <em>centuries</em>, even though only a few moments pass to outside observers. One can try to pass beyond the Earth's concept of the Solar System, which is <strong>very slow</strong> (no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTL">FTL</a> in the Astral Realms, where there <em>is</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">sense of scale</a>) and will often be driven mad by the <em>incredibly long isolation</em>, while not succombing to deprivation because it actually takes a few hours.
