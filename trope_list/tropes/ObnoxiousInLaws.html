</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> couple faces various problems, but none quite like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom">Sitcom</a> In-Law. A member of one spouse's family (often the wife's in modern Western media; in more traditional and Eastern ones it's the husband's relatives who are the terrors) has an obvious animosity towards their relative's spouse. They hate the person their daughter/sister/son/brother is married to and aren't shy about reaffirming it. While the object of this hate always tries to be nice to them (often at the insistence of their partner/spouse), the in-laws pull out all the stops to ridicule, abuse, and undermine their target, and even try to set up their relative with somebody else, in spite of them being married (as well as the fact that their spouse is still alive... which they are occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution">okay with "fixing"</a>.) There are a few reasons why something like this happens:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><ol><li> Most of the time, they just hate the poor guy (or girl in some cases) for no reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyCouldntYouBeDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyCouldntYouBeDifferent">other than not being a millionaire (or something like that).</a>
</li><li> Another common reason is that the spouse is considered to be a step down from a previous relationship — if that's the case, and the ex is still around, the person may be "convinced" to give their ex another chance.
</li><li> Occasionally, the hate stems from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">past incident that the hero/heroine has long since made up for.</a>
</li><li>Peer pressure from the friends and relatives of the in-laws, who may despise one partner for some flaw (real or perceived).
</li><li>Culture clash. Different cultures can have wildly different ideas about gender roles, and what a "good" marriage looks like. This can be particularly difficult because such differences are often part of the reason that the couple like each other in the first place (in particular, differences in ideas about who should get what kind of education).
</li><li>Unfortunately still very commonly faced by LGBTQ couples even in otherwise very tolerant societies. There are many people who are tolerant of something until their child gets involved in it.
</li><li>Generational and cultural differences concerning how to raise children. This can lead to one or more in-laws (usually the groom's mother) being very nice when the couple got married and then turning on the bride seemingly out of nowhere. Unjustified accusations of child abuse can be very difficult to deal with and can even land couples in legal trouble.
</li><li> Or it could just be some people are...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">just jerks.</a>
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is a trope that has shifted in the last few centuries. When co-residence with the husband's parents was the practice, the mother-in-law might play the tyrant as the alpha female of the household. But if the marriage was arranged between the parents of the couple, at least grudging acceptance of the spouse would be necessary to maintain family relations. On the other hand, in the modern day, in western cultures choosing your own spouse is the norm, and may even run counter to parental wishes. But it is much easier to move far away and never see them again.
</p><p>As the page quote indicates, this can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for reasons both good and silly. However, the trope is far more common in fiction than it is in reality. This is probably because although most of us end up with perfectly nice in-laws, everyone is justifiably scared that their in-laws will be this trope.

Uta and Reiichi's estranged mother has a poor relationship with her children, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">guilt-tripping Uta for staying with her older brother Reiichi and his wife Kaoru and taking advantage of their kindness, belittling her as someone who can't do anything for herself, and telling Reiichi to shut up when he tries to intercede on Uta's behalf</a>. On the other hand, she gets along well with her daughter-in-law Kaoru, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriendsInLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriendsInLaw">who's her best friend's daughter</a>, and even offers performs an examination on Kaoru's recent leg injury, despite having lost her medical license in Japan (the cause of her estrangement from her children).

Since they'd pressured Machi to get good grades as a child and want her to marry a successful man as an adult, Machi rebels and decides to "marry" her kohai Hana, resulting in Machi's parents throwing them both out of the house. Mrs. Morimoto later pays Machi a visit, proving rude and dismissive of Hana despite Hana's efforts to be polite to her mother-in-law, and expressing disgust for same-sex relationships. Machi implies that her mother would also be hard on any son-in-law she might have.

A woman begins to suspect her recently widowed apartment neighbor murdered her mother-in-law, due to a combination of rumors about the neighbor's abusive behavior and the discovery of a piece of human bone inside a potted plant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The neighbor, Mrs. Tonegawa, was subjected to horrible emotional abuse by her mother-in-law that went well beyond animosity for marrying her son. The older woman would tell everyone her daughter-in-law was a lazy, shiftless do-nothing who would never lift a finger around the house. When Mrs. Tonegawa finally called her mother-in-law out on this, the older woman threw herself out of the apartment and started loudly begging forgiveness as a way to mock her. Mrs. Tonegawa suspected even if they'd met under different circumstances the older woman would've still hated her. The bone fragment belonged to <em>Mr.</em> Tonegawa, who died in the same accident that eventually killed his mom. His wife had a breakdown after her husband's last words were towards his mom, and in a moment of weakness put the bones from his urn into their potted plants (she couldn't stand her husband being buried next to his mother). She changed her mind later on and put the pieces back in the urn, but obviously missed one.</span> All in all, the story shows the toll this type of relationship can have on a person in real life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>: Kiritsugu initially has a perfectly cordially relationship with his father-in-law, Jubstacheit Von Einzbern, because it was a business relation to win the Fourth Holy Grail War. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the war's conclusion, Jubstacheit forbids him from returning to the Einzbern household for "losing" the war, which means he never saw his daughter again.</span>

The final daughter Laure is getting married to a Catholic man (to the relief of the parents and the local priest), named Charles... who, it turns out, is black.

<ul><li> One man once wrote a letter to his daughter's ex-boyfriend. He claims he can't sleep ever since he damaged the relationship. He claims he's writing the letter in hopes the potential son-in-law forgives and forgets. The man said that, when he saw the boy for the first time, he was surprised with the tattoos and the nose ring, but nowadays he doesn't mind that much. He also understands that riding a motorcycle at high speed and without a helmet isn't that dangerous as long as one pays attention to the other vehicles. The man also understands his reaction to the fact the boy never worked was quite inadequate and too extreme and unfair. He's quite convinced many good and able people also must live under bridges and sleeping in parks. He now also understands that the fact his daughter wants to get married at age 17 instead of attending an ivy-league college, is simply an alternative for her education since not everything is taught at books and school. Sometimes he realizes how outdated he could be while meddling in topics of that nature and he recognizes he's wrong. He claims to have been foolish for opposing them and wished to redeem himself by giving his blessings. He even signed his letter as "your future father-in-law". Then he wrote a P.S. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">congratulating the boy for his lottery winnings</span>.

The man insists that the body be returned to the States.

It probably has something to do with the way Lily ran off on Marshall a couple of months before their wedding (as there was never any contention between them mentioned or shown prior to this). Though Marshall and Lily eventually made up, it would appear Marshall's mother never forgot. She also didn't like that Lily refused to be a "Mrs. Eriksen" by keeping her own name.

<ul><li> Carla believes her brother can only speak Spanish, but he learned English some time ago. He deliberately only speaks English in front of Turk, so that Turk will look like an asshole when protesting he knows the language. After Turk manages to trick him into revealing he's bilingual, he gets no reprimand from his sister. Even after he punches her boyfriend in the face directly in front of her. Similarly, whenever Turk says something bad about Carla's mom, she makes him go to her grave and beg for forgiveness (he often comes back and says "She still hates me").
</li><li> On the other hand, Carla was <em>terrified</em> at how great she and his mom got on, afraid that he was acting out some Oedipal issues. He explains that it's not like <em>that</em>, he was just raised to respect and admire strong, independent women (like his mother), so of course, he would end up with one.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a Greek sitcom called <em>Seven Deadly Mother-in-Laws</em> running with much success for over three seasons; the author believes the theme is clear. They originally took stereotypical mothers-in-law from various regions of Greece, but it soon extended far beyond the original seven. The show REALLY jumped the shark with the Mother-in-Law from Space...

Christine doesn't have this problem, though. On the other hand, considering the tension that exists between brothers-in-law Greg and Jimmy, much of the show has this trope as its premise.

Even the way the African-American family found out she was dating a white man was the same. Most of the family warmed up to him quickly (though it was a rocky start), but Will's mother took a while.

In many ways, it mirrors the relationship between Emily and Lorelai, but Trix and Emily's relationship worsens each time. Her crowning moment would be when Emily discovers a secret letter that Trix wrote to Richard <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> begging him not to marry Emily as she was not suitable for the Gilmore name</span> while she handles Trix's funeral arrangements and will.

(Considering what she suffered from Trix, it's hard to find a bigger hypocrite).
</li><li> Luke views his brother-in-law TJ as this and only tolerates him for his sister Liz's sake. In an aversion, TJ is simply obliviously obnoxious as he does like Luke and treats him like a brother.

</li><li> A tradition of Brazilian comedy series, especially when the son-in-law is deserving. Of note is sitcom <em>Sai de Baixo</em>, where Caco Antibes called his mother-in-law Cassandra 'Cascacu' (a mix between "cascavel", rattlesnake, and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachesis_muta">surucucu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and frequently hazed her hair, clothes and supposed lewd behavior - and the actor loved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">improvise</a> by adding an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a> to her career or even kiss her!

<ul><li> Sophia was extremely obnoxious to her son Phil's wife. She couldn't even be nice to her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at his funeral. It ultimately wasn't that Sophia disliked her, but that she needed someone to redirect the blame to over Phil's cross-dressing.</span> She's also implied to have been no less obnoxious to Dorothy's ex-husband Stan before the divorce than she was after, having never forgiven him for getting Dorothy pregnant at seventeen and cheating on her multiple times after their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">Shotgun Wedding</a>. The only one of her children's spouses she wasn't obnoxious towards was with Gloria's very wealthy husband.
</li><li> Dorothy's ex-mother-in-law was an odd example. She actually liked Dorothy, yet it was Stan whom she didn't like. The only reason she was mean to Dorothy was that if Stan thought she liked Dorothy he'd be around her place all the time asking for money.
</li><li> Blanche's mother-in-law would always introduce her as her son's first wife, while they were still married, and wished on her deathbed for Blanche to have the disease that was killing her. Blanche's only response to hearing that she died was to say that she hoped the old witch went slowly. Blanche herself is implied to be obnoxious to her own unseen son-in-law, derisively referring to him as "the Yankee".
</li><li> Furthermore, Sophia said there was a tradition in Sicily that someone performs when their mother-in-law dies: they're supposed to wear a hair shirt, eat dirt, and pound their head on a rock... anything to keep you from laughing.

This case is somewhat Justified, as Mark doesn't treat Becky exceptionally well initially, being really selfish and obnoxious. When Mark confronts Roseanne about this, she says she would have treated him like a king if she felt like he'd treated Becky with any kind of respect. Darlene's steady boyfriend David fared quite a bit better. Initially, they dislike David for being Mark's brother and assume he's just like him. However, when they realize he was almost his exact opposite, they warm up, allowing him to live with them to escape his abusive mother; Roseanne even tries to shove David and Darlene back together after they break up.

To appease them, he makes <em>both</em> types of dumplings, letting the audience decide for themselves which way they'd like to follow along with.

<ul><li> In "Crawlspace", Linda's mother so grates on Bob that he hides from her by pretending to be stuck inside the wall. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>, but by the end of the episode, they seem to be patching things up.
</li><li> There are a few episodes where Bob comes into conflict with Linda's neurotic sister Gayle, like in "Art Crawl" where she guilt-trips Bob and Linda into displaying her paintings of animal buttholes in the restaurant, or when she tried to have an affair with Bob in "Dr. Yap" after he mistook her for Linda and kissed her while high on his dentist's anesthetic. It finally came to a boiling point in "Gayle Making Bob Sled" when, after Gayle spent the episode faking her leg injury and forcing Bob to do all sorts of humiliating stuff for her, Bob admits how much he hates Gayle. By the end of the episode it seems they've reconciled when Gayle tries to help Bob to make up for what she did, but they never exactly become friends in later episodes to the point Bob would rather not be around her.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow">The Cleveland Show</a></em>, Cleveland's mother Cookie frequently exchanges insults with Donna. Her first appearance implies she was not happy about her initially breaking her son's heart to be with Robert.
</li><li> Elise's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em> to Chris. Chris, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> he is, tries to win them over, with limited success. Elise, on the other hand, finds their visits stressful because of their treatment of Chris, and Dan tries to convince Chris that his efforts to get them to like him are futile. In "Family Camping Trip" Chris does manage to win over Elise's mother, but her father still seems to hate him, even more so, due to one-upping Elise's ex-boyfriend who proved to be a coward in the face of danger. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in "Chris". Elise's parents try to goad Dan into <em>killing</em> Chris. Dan refuses to go along with their plans since he doesn't trust people who want to have their own son-in-law killed off. Thankfully, Chris' brother-in-law isn't quite as bad as his parents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mama Cosma is this to Wanda and Big Daddy is this to Cosmo.
</li><li> In "Timmy Turnip", it turns out Timmy's maternal grandparents don't like his father, even continuously referring to him as the "son-in-law that we don't like" and, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>, gives him bags full of rabid weasels.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>
<ul><li> Peter Griffin's father Francis doesn't like that Peter has married Lois, who is — to quote a sign on their car after their wedding — "a Protestant whore". Lois is very happy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when he dies</span>.
</li><li> Lois' father Carter runs away with this trope as far as his relationship with Peter, to the point that he even lied in court when Peter was accused of murdering Lois (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in Stewie's simulation</span>). Other points of cruelty include putting out his cigar in his chest, forcing him to eat a pine cone while ostensibly saying it's to help Lois, and forcing him to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">drink his diabetic blood</a></em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">and then being absolutely amazed that he actually did it.</a>) Before her death, Lois' Aunt Marguerite was apparently so mean, a visit from her was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment for Peter.
</li><li> Peter usually gets along well with Lois' sister Carol (she being the only one in Lois' family who supported Lois and Peter's relationship), though is implied to loathe all of her previous husbands for their annoying habits. Her current spouse, Mayor Adam West is kooky and childlike enough to become Peter's friend, however.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em>, Wilma's mother is like this with Fred. Though, he does treat her appropriately with equal hostility. In some incarnations, this is because Wilma's family is rich, and they're rather disappointed that Wilma married "beneath" her. However, considering how she shoves aside an airline attendant when disembarking a plane, she's obviously nasty to nearly everyone.
</li><li> Lord Bravery from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em> was shown to have a less than pleasant relationship with his mother-in-law.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GlennMartinDDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GlennMartinDDS">Glenn Martin DDS</a></em>: Glenn is a successful dentist, but Jackie's rich father hates him for not being rich enough.
</li><li> Cotton Hill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>. And Minh's father isn't too fond of Kahn, either. That said, Cotton only <em>barely</em> treats Peggy worse than he treats Hank.
<div class="indent"><strong>Cotton:</strong> You're not even good enough to be married to my worthless, nothing-of-a-loser <em>son!</em>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>, Rick is treated as a burden by his son-in-law due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who wrangles his grandson Morty (and inevitably the rest of the family) in weird and dangerous misadventures, but for whatever reason Rick's daughter insists on letting him stay in the family. Rick for his part treats Jerry with nothing but contempt due to the fact that Jerry is a dullard who got his daughter pregnant when she was 17. Rick also isn't fond of the fact that Jerry is the father of his grandchildren and that his genes could affect them and turn them into losers. There's also a hint that Jerry is possibly jealous of the amount of time Summer and Morty spend with Rick and that they might view Rick as more of a role model than Jerry. However, unlike most examples, Rick never attempts outright to try and break his daughter and son-in-law up. In one episode, he even books them a couples therapy to help fix their marriage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Patty and Selma (and their mother to a lesser extent) hate Homer so much they've nonchalantly reacted to his heart attack then proceeded to find Marge a man despite the fact he hadn't died, bought a tombstone with "Homer J. Simpson. We are richer for having lost him.", tried to get him kicked out of town, tried to have a law proposition passed that would make it illegal for him to live in Springfield, and kidnap/torture him (in full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>-ish <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Saw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Saw">Saw</a></em> rip-off style) during his renewal of his vows with Marge (they seriously thought that if they kept him away Marge would just up and go choose another man eventually). This doesn't even include verbal insults. Obviously, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">depending on the episode</a>. In one episode, Selma thanks Homer for helping her get Ling (her Chinese adopted baby), and Marge's mother didn't really get angry and actually said that Patty and Selma were evil. Selma is more often the more civil one and Patty even asked Homer to perform her wedding after he became an ordained minister.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">Agnes Skinner</a> with her son Seymour. She hates Seymour's choice in women, especially Edna Krabappel.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, Mary Jane's aunt Anna has nothing but bad things to say about Peter in spite of the fact that Peter was never anything but courteous towards her. She sets out to find fault in every little thing he says/does. At one point she sics <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em> on him! (Albeit unintentionally. She just happened to believe that Peter had <em>something</em> to do with MJ's disappearance and voiced this concern to Frank and she happened to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">Right for the Wrong Reasons</a>: it <em>was</em> Peter's fault, because she was collateral damage to one of his fights as Spidey. But, once again, Anna didn't know that — she's only thinking Peter's to blame for no good reason other than her own immense distrust of him.) "Return of Hydro Man part 1" is when Peter finally gets sick of it and calls her out on it.
</li><li> In one episode of "The Bears' Family Album" segment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWoodyWoodpeckerShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWoodyWoodpeckerShow">The Woody Woodpecker Show</a></em>, Charlie Bear tried to escape his mother-in-law, who spent the biggest part of the episode nagging him into spring cleaning while all he wanted to do was fishing with a friend. As an unexpected result of his last plan, Charlie met a guard who, once meeting the mother-in-law, decided Charlie had already had enough and let him go while he started to point out irregularities with her car. Charlie and his friend ended the episode laughing at her misfortune with the guard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>: "Game of Flags" shows there's more than a little hostility between Queen Moon's side of the family (the Butterflies, a clan of conniving and foppish nobles) and King River's side of the family (the Johansens, a clan of uncouth barbarian warriors).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> — Charlotte Pickles is this to Stu and Didi Pickles (her husband, Drew, is Stu's brother). However, Charlotte really isn't outright mean to them or anyone else, though she does often come off as rather snobbish and condescending.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> — Toph appears to be this to Bataar Beifong Sr., the husband of her youngest daughter, Suyin (more commonly called "Su" for short). However, Toph doesn't really seem to hate her son-in-law—though she certainly hates it when he tries calling her "mother," which Toph makes extremely clear to him when he tries making small talk with her.
</li><li> Gramma Alice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigCityGreens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigCityGreens">Big City Greens</a></em> is this to her ex-daughter-in-law, Nancy, distrusting her for her criminal past. At least one flashback suggests she was like this during Nancy and Bill's marriage as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FIsForFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FIsForFamily">F is for Family</a></em>: Frank's parents-in-law openly despise him, constantly make snide remarks about his lack of success in life, and blame him for getting Sue pregnant so early, forcing her to drop out of college. Frank is happy to give it right back, pointing out their hypocrisy over their estranged son, who's implied to be gay.

<ul><li> Let's face it, some of us have <em>at least</em> one.
</li><li> Advice columns are rife with stories about people like this—Dear Prudence even printed a compilation of the best/worst stories, the winner/loser of which was the woman who realized that her mother-in-law was <em>poisoning</em> her.
</li><li> There's an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">Reddit</a> support group called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/">Just No Mother-In-Law<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that helps people deal with their awful mothers/mothers-in-law... where some of the worst stories include kidnapping, arson, assault, involuntary psychiatric holds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentChildIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentChildIncest">emotional/physical incest</a>, killing pets, suicide, murder, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">wearing a wedding dress to their son's/daughter's wedding</a>.
</li><li> Previous to the Cultural Revolution, the obnoxious in-law was such a self-perpetuating cycle (new wife/concubine moves into her husband's household; disapproving mother-in-law and/or head wife/other concubine makes life hell for the wife/concubine; wife/concubine becomes most emotionally attached to her own son(s); son becomes old enough to get married; rinse and repeat) in China that it was taken as a matter of fact.
</li><li> While in Western culture, it's considered more proper for a man to take his wife's side in such arguments (a number of Christian scholars insist that a man's primary loyalty is to his immediate family, meaning wife and children, with parents being secondary), things may be reversed in some Asian countries, which place a great emphasis on respect for the elders. Some cultures employ the "plenty of fish in the sea" argument (i.e. "you can always find another wife, but you only have one mother").
</li><li> Empress Kojun, wife of Emperor Hirohito and mother of the Emperor Emeritus Akihito, was reportedly this to her daughter-in-law, Empress Michiko; she apparently disapproved of Michiko being born a commoner and thought she was unsuited to marry into the imperial family.
