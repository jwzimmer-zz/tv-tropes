Heroes and villains can expend enormous amounts of ammo shooting at each other, often with automatic weapons and/or at very close range, yet everybody important is protected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>.

It's not that the bullets aren't potentially lethal, but everyone's accuracy is so horrible that they seem to hit everything <em>except</em> their foe, even in situations where they have a clear line of fire and you'd think it would be almost impossible to miss. When the fight's over, all the property and vehicles in the area will be chewed up with bullet holes, yet there will be no perforated corpses to match. This trope differs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy</a> in that instead of just the bad guy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> being unable to hit the hero as he slaughters them with his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a>, A-Team Firing makes everybody on <em>both</em> sides keep missing.

A writer trying to be realistic about how dangerous both arrows and bullets are in the right hands would have to make the people firing them unable to hit the broad side of a barn in order to draw fights out for dramatic effect. In the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a>, however, the real reason was that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em> was nominally a kid's show in prime time, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">killing was a network no-no</a>; It was overlooked at the time due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>, and in fact the movie remake was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">heavily criticized by fans for actually showing the heroes killing people</a>. This trope can be related to instances where the goodies deliberately miss their shots because they do not wish to kill anyone, but ironically the intentionally non-lethal use of firearms tends to require the opposite trope—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a>—for tricks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlastingItOutOfTheirHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlastingItOutOfTheirHands">Blasting It Out of Their Hands</a> or winging the bad guys in order to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">Only a Flesh Wound</a>. Most of the time, A-Team firing is depicted as unintentional.

Any sustained automatic fire from a hand held weapon will require divine intervention to actually hit its target, because the recoil from each successive shot will force the weapon's muzzle to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_climb">rise up<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> until all of the rounds are passing harmlessly over it. That's why reckless automatic fire is nicknamed "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray_and_pray">spray and pray<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". As for non-automatic weapons, handguns are known for only having an effective range of about <em>30 feet</em> for most nonprofessional users, since they have a shorter sight radius to aim with, as well as less weight and fewer anchor points (i.e. buttstock and foregrip) to help control recoil. So under most conditions, this trope could be interpreted not as "all shots have bad luck" but as "no shot gets better than average results (i.e. a miss) no matter how many shots are fired."
</p><p>In past centuries of gunpowder warfare, firearms technology and the quality of training put considerable limits on accuracy. In the old days, every soldier's weapon was muzzle-loaded and single shot. Barrel rifling and tight-fitting lead ball ammunition made a gun more accurate, but they also made it slower and more difficult to reload as powder residue fouled the barrel more with each shot. Since the steps of reloading took a long time to begin with, making it even slower was a big disadvantage while under fire. Therefore, most regular infantry used smoothbore muskets while rifles were more often limited to hunters, sharpshooters, and skirmishers. It was also easier to reload a musket quickly using under-size balls, even though the loose fit and random spin imparted to the bullet tended to send it off target upon leaving the barrel. Admittedly, even an unrifled musket in competent hands could be used to hit an individual 100 yards away, but the average recruit's target-hitting ability was very poor, and most armies didn't want to spend large amounts of expensive powder and ammunition by giving everyone extensive target practice.
</p><p>Especially in the 18th century, military leaders believed that collective volume of fire was more important than individual accuracy for inflicting casualties. To achieve this they trained their troops to load and fire as rapidly as possible in volleys, directing their fire at the whole enemy formation rather than picking individual targets. Even if most of the bullets in a given volley missed the enemy, sheer numbers would ensure that some would hit, and rapid firing would make that damage keep adding up. What's more, the shooting was often merely intended to soften up the enemy before a decisive bayonet charge. The ability to pick off individuals at range was of limited use in a massed battle anyway, because black powder guns produced huge amounts of smoke: the battlefield would be shrouded in an impenetrable fog after a few volleys, rendering one's aiming skills rather moot.
</p><p>The effect of firearms with higher potential accuracy and rate of fire has been to change tactics, ironically leading to similarly low rates of accuracy for different reasons. Targets that move quickly and stay behind cover instead of lining up in the open are naturally harder to hit, and when they are returning fire one's own ability to concentrate, aim and shoot will be seriously impacted. Furthermore, a lot of bullets are fired for reasons other than directly killing the enemy. Modern small arms tactics revolve around <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressive_fire">suppressive fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and maneuver, in which one part of a military force puts out sustained fire towards the enemy not so much to inflict casualties as to pin them down behind cover and restrict their ability to move or fire back. While the enemy is being suppressed, other elements can maneuver in close and go for the kill. Another ammo-intensive technique is Reconnaissance by Fire, in which a force which doesnt know exactly where the enemy is hiding will shoot preemptively at potential enemy hiding places to cover their advance. The amount of ammo used in warfare today is staggering. Although ammo expenditure and enemy kill figures are notoriously unreliable, John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org <a class="urllink" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-forced-to-import-bullets-from-israel-as-troops-use-250000-for-every-rebel-killed-314944.html">estimated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that U.S. forces fired something like 250,000 bullets (including large numbers fired in practice) for each enemy combatant killed between 2002 and 2005.
</p><p>The opposite of this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a>, and the bladed weapon counterpart is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flynning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flynning">Flynning</a>, in which swords clash but nobody goes for the kill. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">Bloodless Carnage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLethalWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonLethalWarfare">Non-Lethal Warfare</a>, which often motivate this trope. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerfulButInaccurate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerfulButInaccurate">Powerful, but Inaccurate</a>, when the inaccuracy is canonically a property of the weapon.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AriaTheScarletAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AriaTheScarletAmmo">Aria the Scarlet Ammo</a> AA</em>, main character Akari begins as this.

However, as Butei are supposed to capture criminals alive she desperately tries to suppress this instinctive skill and as a result winds up unable to hit anything instead.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>, the constant barrage of fire from military agents, professional assassins, an artificial intelligence, and a class of middle school students virtually never hits the target. Justified by the fact that said target is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">impossibly fast</a> octopus who is insanely good at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">dodging things</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>, on occasion, suffers from this trope. The best example is the gun battle between Revy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">Killer Maid</a> Roberta. Despite the fact that they fire countless rounds at each other without either taking cover (sometimes at near point-blank range), they only hit each other once, both times apparently only giving each other a minor wound.
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BurstAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BurstAngel">Burst Angel</a></em> sees two opponents firing away at each other at point blank range (like, four metres) like no tomorrow, without a single hit.
</li><li> Akane from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kampfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kampfer">Kämpfer</a></em> fits this trope perfectly. Even with superpowers complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence">Transformation Sequence</a>, her expert gun handling hasn't served to hit a single target. To be fair, most of the missed bullets were dodged by her opponents at light speed.
</li><li> Neither the militant Library Task Force of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LibraryWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LibraryWar">Library War</a></em> nor their pro-censorship nemesis, the Media Cleansing Committee, ever seem to hit anything despite their constant barrages of automatic weapons fire, making it one of the most peaceful (and legal!) civil wars ever depicted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team</a></em> allows enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> Norris Packard to hang a lampshade on this when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> Shiro Amada <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike">fires every weapon he has simultaneously</a> at him, without managing to land a single hit.
<div class="indent"><em>Well, that <strong>looked</strong> impressive.</em>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>. Because the main character can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgeTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgeTheBullet">dodge bullets</a> and refuses to kill or seriously injure his enemies, 99% of the bullets fired in the series accomplish nothing besides property destruction. In fact, in the teaser to the first episode, a bunch of criminals unload countless rounds of ammunition into a restaurant. When they stop, the whole building's been demolished except for Vash, the stool he's sitting on, and the little bit of counter in front of him, which are all completely unharmed.
<ul><li> In the actual first episode, the reason that little slice of real estate is unharmed is because it was shielded by the tavern's very sturdy sign, which, when no longer propped up by the repeated impact of incoming bullets on one side, fell over. It wasn't so much that they all <em>missed</em> the target as that there was something bulletproof in the way.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Xabungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Xabungle">Xabungle</a></em>, like many, "many" mecha shows, uses this to a certain extreme — but subverts it with its usual comedy. Despite virtually every face character facing a hail of human-scale bullets at some point or another, the number who are wounded from it (let alone killed) can be counted on one hand. It isn't from lack of trying — they're all "really" good at dodging on foot.
<div class="indent">"I'm not gonna hit anything anyway! I'm just a minor character, dammit!"

In the last chapter of a five-part story involving The Question breaking up a kidnapping/prostitution/smuggling organization, she is fleeing the home of the ringleader while being shot at by numerous members of his villainous entourage, only to simply run straight past the entrance gate without even a token roll to evade the gunfire. When she has run out of sight, one of the shooters turns to the others and states that they "are the worst shots <em>ever.</em>"
</li><li> Played painfully straight in the "Two-Face: Year One" comic.

<ul><li> Swerve is a comically bad shot. He's only scored three direct hits in the entire run of the comic. Two were accidental headshots on the ship's psychologist and himself (both of them got better). He manages to miss the broad side of one of the largest Transformers shown thus far at point blank range.
</li><li> On the Decepticon side of things, there's Misfire, who can basically be summed up as "Like Swerve, but worse in every way." He's killed more Decepticons by accident than he has Autobots on purpose. Apparently when he's called upon to actually <em>try</em> to use a gun properly, he's very, very bad at it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Misfire:</strong> They call me Misfire. Long story. Actually, you know what? It isn't. It's a very short story involving a machine gun, a misunderstanding, and a dozen dead Decepticons.

</li><li> Battle sequences in various incarnations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> are filled with rainbows of laser fire, but rarely do any non-clone/non-stormtrooper/droid characters get hit.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em>, a random gunman takes the lead characters by surprise and unloads a large-caliber revolver at them, only for him to miss every shot and get gunned down after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Beat</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson">Jules</a> interprets this unlikely scenario as divine intervention, and decides to give up the life of a gangster and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkTheEarth">Walk the Earth</a>. Divine indeed: the two bullet holes over the shoulders is just coincidental. As for one bullet hole that suggest a shoulder hit and another that suggest a punctured lung, these can't be explained by science.

</li><li> Used in the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DerClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DerClown">Der Clown</a></em> movie <em>Payday</em>, but not played too straight: The German version of SWAT can fire their machine guns without hitting anyone. The unarmored villains can mow down most SWAT members in body armor with machine guns and shoot through steel ropes with pistols, but fail to hit the heroes unless by accidentally pulling the trigger. The heroes' firing is apparently so bad again, combined with their constant lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">dakka</a>, that they have to resort on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blowing up an entire aircraft to kill the baddies inside</span>.

Partially. When someone needs to get killed, they do, but there <em>are</em> sequences of a hailstorm of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">dakka</a> failing to connect with anyone on either side.

</li><li> The 2007 Australian film <em>Noise</em> ends with a realistic shootout, and it shows a lot of in-accurate shooting under pressure.

</li><li> In the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop3">RoboCop 3</a></em>, both the good guys (Detroit Police Dept.) and the bad guys (private corporate army and street punks) fire a crapload of ammunition at each other with few people getting shot.

Again, not notable generally, except for the fact the original TV series and comics, being aimed at kids, used A-Team Firing as a matter of course; by the time <em>Rise of Cobra</em> came out, however, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> GI Joe had been established in the comics and in animation, where the heroes were shown to be just as deadly and willing to kill as the villains.

Including missing an aimed shot at a stationary body from less than seven feet away.
</li><li> Blood Makes the Grass Grow Green, Johnny Rico's (real name) autobiographical account of a self-described hippie liberal serving as a US Infantryman in Afghanistan, plays this trope straight. It is, after all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. In one scene, the soldiers and Taliban exchange fire for over a half hour. The soldiers engage with weapons they qualify with, most of them ranked Experts. The Taliban engage with weapons they've been carrying all their lives. Vehicle mounted weapons and rocket-propelled grenades are fired. There were no American casualties and no enemy bodies or blood trails were discovered.

(Although, if you watch it with the sound muted, you'll realize that they're only shooting in semi-automatic mode. The sounds of machine gun fire were added in post-production.)
<ul><li> They hit lots of glass windows, car tires, radiators, and other such things. They just never hit any people.

</li><li> At least one episode ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS2E16SayItWithBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheATeamS2E16SayItWithBullets">Say It with Bullets</a>") saw the team set up an elaborate ruse by making their antagonist Col. Decker believe they were hiding in the guest house on an Army base; the team had rigged a stereo system to play, by remote control, a sound-effects record where one of the tracks was machine gun fire. When Decker is tipped and brings his convoy to the guest house to call the team out, Hannibal cues the stereo, making the soldiers think they are being fired upon... and they return fire, heavily damaging the house. When nobody is found inside, Decker blows his stack, realizing that tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition had been wasted as part of a game played for Hannibal's amusement.
</li><li> They were also pretty good at hitting those amazing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">exploding bushes</a> which inevitably caused a jeep or car to flip over (without injuring the occupants, of course).
</li><li> Subverted in the show itself, in that the times where characters did get shot on-screen, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Face and Murdock in different episodes, though they got better,</span> only a single bullet is fired each time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> B.A. also took one in the leg once, although it happened off-screen, and it was a friendly-fire incident.</span>
</li><li> In many cases it's intentional, the A-Team isn't shooting to kill, but to lure the enemy into a non-lethal trap, or to divert their attention.
</li></ul></li><li> The page quote comes from the Winter Olympics special of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em>, where Jeremy Clarkson decides that the best weapon to use at a biathlon rifle range is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">an MP5 set to fully automatic</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008">Ashes to Ashes (2008)</a></em> premiere has an A-team style shootout moments after Gene Hunt refers to his team as The A-Team.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AuctionKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AuctionKings">Auction Kings</a></em>, Cindy managed to hit the device which carries the target at the shooting range. Paul is a much better shot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has some bad, bad examples of this trope. In "The Gunfighters", seasoned cowboys repeatedly miss some people walking down the middle of a road. In "The Caves of Androzani," the Doctor runs through a long mudfield with little cover except for a few hills, while about a gazillion rounds are fired at him by the pursuing gang of mercenaries, and still manages to escape relatively unscathed- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> so long as you ignore the terminal case of spectrox toxaemia.</span>. There was also a lampshaded defiance of this trope in the more recent episode, A Town Called Mercy, in which the Doctor questions the skill of a gunslinger who only hit the target's hat, only to be informed that it was deliberate. Later there was a justified example, in which said gunslinger somehow managed to shoot much faster than usual, blowing up the town's clock, several windows, a street lamp, and much more besides, without even coming close to the Doctor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was on his knees and flailing his weaponized arm in all directions due to the Doctor overloading him though, so YMMV on whether or not it actually counts as this trope</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em> used it for the first season and a half — then Sydney started killing people. It's not that Sydney missed her shots, though; in general she used tranquilizers until the writers decided they preferred Sydney to off people instead.
</li><li> Any enemy on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em>. To be fair, in one episode, the crew of the <em>Andromeda Ascendant</em> were shown to be wearing "ECM Generators" that "play hell with smart bullets." This is worst when automated defenses are used. These will track dodging enemies, but walking straight at them is perfectly safe. These are the main ship defense weapons used by the heroes, too. It got hijacked and used against them so many times in the first season alone that one of the characters commented something along the lines of: "Automated ships defenses. What kind of a retarded engineer had that put in?" while taking cover from said automatic defense turrets.
</li><li> Ryutaros, who controls <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO">Kamen Rider Den-O's</a></em> Gun Form, has a tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle">hold his gun sideways</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler">dance while fighting</a>. This causes a lot of property damage and very rarely hits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> it was supposed to. However, Ryu never misses with his finisher, which is a single, carefully aimed shot.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad">Police Squad!</a></em>, one of which was where the lead and antagonist are missing shots while 1 foot apart before ducking behind cover. Repeated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedGun">The Naked Gun</a> 2 1/2</em>; same distance and same cover.

</li><li> Carlos Mencia once addressed the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle">gangstas stereotypically hold their guns</a> (sideways, for no readily apparent reason). When taxed, one of them responded that he holds his gun like that when he shoots because it makes him look cool. He's astonished to find that the aiming guide on top of the gun lines up with his target when held the right way up. Then Mencia makes some remark about how only porn stars should look cool when they shoot.
</li><li> Everyone on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em> sucks with their guns. Many of the fights devolve into hand to hand combat, and any stand off is solved just by either side having an extra gun pointed at the rest.
</li><li> The panicked wedding party in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HarpersIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HarpersIsland">Harper's Island</a></em> are all lousy shots. Once they work out they're being attacked, they break out the guns, hang onto them obsessively and all completely fail to hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, even from a few feet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> there's a shootout between rival street gangs in which nobody gets hit, except from a kid who catches a stray bullet on the second floor of an apartment building. <em>The Wire</em> actually deliberately invoked this trope. At one point one of the police officers observes that most of the kids in the gangs are so untrained with guns that they're more likely to hit innocent bystanders than their intended target. (And we do see a few people like Chris and Snoop who <em>do</em> train, and are substantially more dangerous.)
</li><li> Parodied in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadTV">MADtv</a></em> skit in which a veteran cop gets a new partner who's a rookie. The veteran cop is captured by a thug wielding a blade and the rookie tries to shoot the thug, only to hit his partner... repeatedly. The veteran suggests aiming for him instead of the thug and just ends up getting shot in the nut-sack. He declares that he'd rather take his chances with the blade, which is kind of dull, but the rookie cop insists he's not letting the thug get away. The thug eventually decides to leave the scene and he walks way. The rookie "pursues," but no matter how close he gets, he can't achieve the shot and the ricochet bounces to the veteran. The thug picks up a penny off the ground and leaves. The rookie cop calls for medical aid for the veteran, but reaches Domino's Pizza instead.
</li><li> Parodied in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Danger5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Danger5">Danger 5</a></em>, when the heroes and villains fire directly at each other in a nightclub to no effect, other than killing every single random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander">Innocent Bystander</a>.

In one notable episode, every single member of a firing squad missed the person they were supposed to be executing, instead shooting the water tower.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zixx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zixx">Zixx</a></em>, during the virtual reality/game sequences, the heroes will often be chased by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> ineffectively spraying laser fire at them.

The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader">Rogue Trader</a></em> RPG points out that all Ork weapons are actually <em>smoothbore</em>, as their genetically-engineered technical knowledge apparently doesn't include that whole "spin-stabilized ballistics" thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a> Fantasy Battle</em>: Orcs + bows = roughly the same. Ironically (and/or realistically), Orks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subvert</a> the trope by compensating for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">terrible marksmanship</a> with use of heavy weapons or a large amount of firepower (or preferably large amounts of heavy weapons, if they have the resources for it). While machine guns or things that go boom can compensate for a glaringly bad marksman much of the time, a humble bow or carbine is a much more formidable weapon when wielded by every member of an infantry horde who can focus firepower.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Warmachine</a></em>, any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Menoth</a> unit with a ranged attack is guaranteed to have laughable accuracy. This is most notable in the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">Zealots</a>, whose whole strategy is throwing remarkably unstable explosives at ludicrously short range.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern">d20 Modern</a></em>, automatic weapons get the shaft. 2 feats are required in order to properly use an automatic weapon, one for proficiency with guns, the other to not suffer a penalty when firing full-auto. And even if you have those feats, you target a 10-by-10 area with an AC of 10, to make the opponents have to make a DC 15 reflex save (fixed, with no way to modify) to take no damage; you use 10-rounds to attempt to hit at most 4 halfling-sized enemies with 1 bullet each. A third feat is required for you to be able to burst-fire, which is actually not useless. Without that third feat, you can target a single target with auto-fire, but it is a senseless waste of ammo because only 1 round (of the 10 fired) can hit. Some guns even have a 3-round burst mode, but if you don't "know" how to burst-fire, then tough luck, you can't use that mode (you can, but much like auto-fire against a single opponent, it's a waste of ammo). To summarize: Without building your character to fully use automatic weapons, you will quickly get to the point to where you can't do anything <em>but</em> spray-and-pray with automatic fire.
</li><li> In the second and third editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> (as well as the first edition if optional rules from a later expansion were used), the more bullets you fired, the less likely you were to hit with <em>any of them</em>. This was because the number of bullets fired was added to the target number for the attack, and only one roll was made to see if that attack as a whole hit. Thus, firing a single round might have a target number of 4, while firing a ten-round burst would increase that target number to 14, and if you didn't beat that 14, all your ten rounds would miss. The reason for firing more than one round was that the damage caused would increase per round, so if you did hit with a ten-round burst you pretty much guaranteed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet">instant death</a> with most weapons.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In general, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">inspired trend</a> of forcing the player to aim with ironsights for any semblance of accuracy leads to the effect that <em>not</em> aiming while firing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsDoNotWorkThatWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsDoNotWorkThatWay">somehow makes bullets veer off at sharp angles away from where the gun is actually aiming</a>. Sniper rifles have generally been like this for even longer, mostly as a balancing measure because of their extreme power and long-range accuracy, which in some extreme cases can have bullets exiting the barrel at close to <em>ninety</em>-degree angles. <em>Call of Duty</em>'s success also ensures that all dumb-fire rocket-propelled grenades in games released since are incapable of hitting their target unless the shooter is close enough to kill <em>himself</em> with the explosion, simply because dumb-fire rocket-propelled grenades in <em>Call of Duty</em> were similarly inaccurate.
<ul><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussed</a> by Sergeant Foley during the tutorial for <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, where he admonishes the Afghan militia for just randomly firing from the hip and never hitting anything.
</li></ul></li><li> Momo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII">Breath of Fire III</a></em> was the only character in the game who suffered from horrible accuracy rates. Incidentally, her weapon of choice was a bazooka.
</li><li> Similarly to Momo, in the Super Famicom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> RPG, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Mihoshi</a> is the only character whose attacks can miss — namely, her basic attack is a three-round burst from her gun. She even has an embarrassed reaction when it happens.
</li><li> Seen in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a></em> series due to its use of realistic firearm accuracy. Automatic fire from a shoulder fired weapon will have little chance of hitting the target, doubly so if you are shooting on the run. Heavy support weapons are have even worse accuracy when fired from a standing position and will have problems hitting a target even at point blank range. This results in numerous instances of soldiers circling around each other at arms length burning through their entire magazine without hitting a thing.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0l0yy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0l0yy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0l0yy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">These are likely veterans of earlier, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake">Quake</a></em>-style FPS games that emphasized movement over cover as effective defense. Network latency may also be to blame.</span>
<ul><li> Shooting from a prone or crouched position increases accuracy, along with using controlled semi-automatic fire or short automatic bursts, just like in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
</li><li> Taken to ridiculous, possibly parodying lengths in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldHeroes">Battlefield Heroes</a></em>; unless using the scope, the Commando's sniper rifle can actually hit things <em>behind</em> the gun's barrel.
</li></ul></li><li> This is how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging">dodge mechanics</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> work: Your character doesn't so much actually dodge rather than the enemy completely failing to hit you. Taken to the extreme, it is perfectly possible to dodge a <em>flamethrower</em> in melee range, just because its user inexplicably aims it over your head!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuneII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuneII">Dune II</a></em>, House Harkonnen's ultimate palace weapon was a long range missile that could easily wipe out a decent chunk of a base. It was also so horrendously inaccurate that targeting dead center would, in all likelihood, hit an area that wasn't even <em>on the screen</em> (assuming you don't move the camera after firing). This is totally unacceptable considering it's a <em>fucking missile</em>, the kind of thing that is supposed to have computer guidance. You would think they have a pair of drunks in the control room trying to eyeball it. You had to either aim away from your target, or build more than one because the game didn't limit you, and Carpet Bomb the whole enemy town.
<ul><li> This actually works for you in the final level, where the enemy can (assuming you don't play Harkonen) have <em>two</em> such structures pitching missiles. If they were properly accurate, the mission would be unwinnable. As well, this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> - computers are forbidden on the pain of your planet getting nuked.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar">Empire: Total War</a></em> is set in the 18th century and therefore features relatively inaccurate muskets and cannon. To offset this, commanders deploy their troops in large blocks of massed line infantry who fire at their enemies in volleys.
</li><li> A case of this afflicts Eliphas the Inheritor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a>: Dark Crusade</em> at the end of the Chaos base assault (although this may be a result of the Warp portal). As his daemonic patron is telling him off, Eliphas flips out and begins firing his plasma pistol, apparently carefully aimed at a spot two feet to the daemon's left.
</li><li> In a subversion, this makes certain enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a> 2</em> harder than its predecessor. In Descent 1, all the enemies fire right at you, which means you can dodge their shots (which is difficult but still possible with homing missiles). In Descent 2, certain enemy robots simply spread a lot of bullets in your general direction, which means that even if you evade there's still something heading for you.
</li><li> All bosses in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> series, who are fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">firing more bullets than you can count</a>, many of which are fired in the opposite direction to you; this isn't so much a terrible aim as to force you to dodge in certain areas, but they sure as hell will be causing a lot of collateral damage. Special mention for Cirno and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"Icicle Fall -Easy-"</a>.
</li><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in-game encyclopedia</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Edge Maverick</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheLastHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheLastHope">Star Ocean: The Last Hope</a></em> suffers from this, which is why he prefers to fight close-range with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords">sword</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's later revealed that Edge is genetically engineered, with reflexes that are much, much faster than a normal human. The flip side is that Edge's reaction time is so fast, he instinctively aims at the spot where the enemy is <em>going</em> to be instead of where it actually is; hence this trope</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> goons will never hit you, no matter how many shots they fire as long as the "Danger" meter doesn't get filled. Conversely, certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> will instantly spike the danger meter, especially on Hard difficulty. The player's weapons shoot like a blind man in a hurricane at full-auto and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotRunWithAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotRunWithAGun">when moving</a>, even with auto-targeting, so it's best to use semi-auto or bursts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> game, your accuracy will go to hell quickly if you try to fire sustained bursts. This is probably the key reason why tommyguns are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> in this game. It also reflects the intended usage of the gun types: the long arms are meant to be assault weapons for going centre-of-mass, as opposed to the handguns which are generally meant for staying behind cover and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">popping heads</a> with.
</li><li> This trope could easily be called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom">X-COM</a> Firing</em>, given the terrible accuracy of rookies who go the route of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Dakka</a>. Fortunately, the aliens aren't much better hitting their targets.
</li><li> Definitely seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> when firing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGuy">The</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Heavy's</a> minigun at any target beyond short-medium range. You can kick out an absurd amount of ammo, and watch as maybe a tenth of them hit a target. Can be useful for suppressing a group if they scatter on taking damage, but don't expect to kill anything until you reach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">short range</a>. Unless you get crits, in which case <em>everyone dies</em>.
</li><li> Most unit firing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes">Company of Heroes</a></em> falls under this. Especially with tanks and vehicles firing on infantry - mostly for balance reasons. Of course, the moment you enable the Direct Control feature for most vehicles by using, say a mod... and are, for example, controlling a Wirbelwind Flakpanzer (four x 20mm) or an M3 Halftrack with the Maxson Mount upgrade (4 x 12.7mm, aka .50cal) then infantry will get PULVERIZED by your attacks.
<ul><li> The American and Wehrmacht Engineers epitomize this in the game - their chance of hitting enemies at long range is 0.1 with their submachine guns. Reasonable for long-range, right? Well, even if at kissing distance, their accuracy's best is 0.3. Moving multiplies their accuracy by <strong>0.15</strong>. They are unable to hit <em>anything</em> while moving, no matter how close. Standing still only makes them lackluster.
<ul><li> Though after spending a few munitions, they can get their hands on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Flamethrower</a>, and they become dangerous. They don't call it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Pyro</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Spam</a> for nothing.
</li><li> Lampshaded by the Rangers upon receiving the Tommy Gun upgrade: "Spray and pray, the SMG way!" However, since accuracy is inversely proportional to distance, they give up some medium- and long-range firepower (which is what Riflemen are for) for being absolute infantry-shredding terrors at short range.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis">Time Crisis</a></em> and <em>Crisis Zone</em> with the standard enemies. In <em>Time Crisis</em>, they're all armed with handguns (a world-threatening terrorist organization that gives almost all of its members handguns. Riiiiiiight) and will miss almost every single shot, very rarely firing one that hits the player and often landing them more than two feet away. <em>Crisis Zone</em> has an even worse problem in that they're armed with <em>assault rifles</em>, and yet fully-automatic fire at point blank range has a very low chance of hitting. Averted with some enemies using machine guns in <em>Time Crisis</em>, as well as the shots that <em>will</em> hit the player in <em>Crisis Zone</em>. The <em>Time Crisis</em> games have machine gun-wielding enemies that will miss dozens of shots, but then hit perfectly with dozens more. The same is done in <em>Crisis Zone</em> when the enemies finally get their act together, going from several bursts going over your head to five rounds hitting perfectly in a row. Some boss enemies will never miss their bursts, requiring you to duck until they stop aiming at you. In two-player installments, if only one player is playing, the unused player character will be shown attacking and hiding...yet <em>every shot will miss.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> uses a modified version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD20" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD20">Star Wars d20</a></em> rules, except when you fire a blaster your character will let off three bolts for every unmodified attack roll, which means that at best you will hit with one in three shots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FullSpectrumWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FullSpectrumWarrior">Full Spectrum Warrior</a></em> uses the suppressive fire tactical variation, given its roots as a military simulation. The game often required you to order your soldiers (individually, or as an entire four-man squad) to lay down suppressive fire on any enemies in a given direction in order to advance; any enemies in that direction will be forced to remain behind cover and will not return fire while being suppressed. While suppressive fire might, on rare occasion, score a hit on an enemy, this was typically so your other soldiers could safely advance, flank, and shoot the enemy with a more precise volley without being shot at themselves. This was counter-balanced by the fact that suppressive fire burned your ammo quickly, and you could only resupply at specific points on the map.
<ul><li> In contrast, you can also order your soldiers (again, individuals or entire squads) to engage in much more accurate point fire, which would typically kill any enemy that isn't behind cover.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline">Air Rivals</a></em>, most mook attacks that are based on guns/laser beams/rockets are unaimed, and in those cases, a simply strafing move will make them miss. It gets ridiculous in a case where the new nation defense systems (nation-aligned mooks that attack invaders only) from BCU are far worse than the old ones, simply because they use unaimed laser machine guns with a visible charging period instead of the quick, auto-aimed attack the old ones had.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em>, if you don't finish lining up a shot with the Hidden Gun, it's more likely than not to miss, even at close range. Ezio seems to have gotten better by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood">Brotherhood</a></em>, though, where he integrates it into CQC without needing to stand around aiming. While finely designed and constructed even by modern standards, that pistol is by necessity unsighted, is affixed to the forearm rather than handheld, and probably has enough recoil to require a braced arm... that is <em>not</em> an easy weapon to aim, much less to snap shots off with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></em>. The CPU players tend to do this when armed with the Cracker Launcher, simply firing it off at random rather than trying to aim up or down towards anyone else.
</li><li> Intentionally invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em>. The two fighting forces you find on each level will shoot at each other, but none of them will hit anything. Of course, the second they turn their guns on <em>you...</em>
</li><li> The MG-42 gunners in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a>: Allied Assault</em> fire aimlessly for several seconds before actually hitting you, at which point they kill you almost instantly. Averted with the other games. Conversely, Nazis wielding <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MP40" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MP40">MP 40</a>'s have improbable accuracy even when blind-firing, while you're reduced to spray &amp; pray or using it at close range.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune">Soldier of Fortune</a> II</em>, automatic weapons are wildly inaccurate at long range in the player's hands, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">but not so</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>. Ditto for other ID Tech 3 engine games, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a>: Allied Assault</em>. Conversely, in the first game, the enemies, excluding the snipers, tend to suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy</a> syndrome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeLongRangeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeLongRangeWeapon">unless at close range</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>, kinetics are generally inaccurate compared to energy weapons even at close range. Targeting techs help somewhat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Assault Rifle, particularly its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">original incarnation</a>. That said, when it was re-introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em>, it became considerably more accurate. While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> further improved its accuracy even more, it also added the so-called "bloom" mechanic; weapons quickly become rather inaccurate if you keep spraying instead of using controlled bursts. While bloom indeed has a negative effect on spraying, the AR's massive bullet magnetism (a function of the game's aim assist that directs bullets towards the target if your aim is off) made players who preferred single-shot and burst-fire weapons loath the AR. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvHYSnDaOk">This short video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> demonstrates exactly why the AR was loathed that much<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ado6');"><sup>Explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ado6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ado6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It takes exactly 16 rounds from the assault rifle to kill an opponent. In the first attempt (full-auto fire), more than half of the 32-rounds magazine miss and the opponent survived. In the second attempt (burst-fire), a total of 22 rounds where fired and the opponent dropped dead after 20 rounds (the last two-rounds burst was fired when the opponent was already dead). This means that the AR's massive bullet magnetism turned 16 of the 20 rounds fired into hits <em>even though the outside of the reticle barely touched the opponent</em></span>. Subsequent games have managed to fine-tune the AR's accuracy while simultaneously toning down on its bullet magnetism.
</li><li> The Submachine Gun originated as the Assault Rifle's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em> replacement, and managed to be even more inaccurate, since the barrel would climb if you fired it on full-auto (even more if you were firing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">two of them at once</a>, which was especially bad since it was <em>designed</em> to be used two at once and thus pretty terrible on its own). However, it eventually evolved into a semi-precision weapon; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></em>'s version was actually the first automatic weapon in the series to come with a scope!
</li><li> The Scorpion in <em>Combat Evolved</em> had a ridiculously large reticle, meaning that the co-axial machine gun was ludicrously inaccurate even at medium range. Depending on the game, even the main cannon had ridiculously wide spread for what it did.
</li><li> Depending on the game, the Needler may have trouble hitting non-close-range targets despite its homing capabilities, due to how relatively slow its projectiles travel.
</li></ul></li><li> The Assault Rifle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em>, with it being handwaved as a "manufacturing defect" in the ammo.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a></em> series, most of the player's submachine guns (other than the standard MP5) fire with the accuracy of a blind epileptic. Even the normally deadly-accurate tangos occasionally exhibit Stormtrooper marksmanship. The <em>Vegas</em> series allows you and the enemy to blind-fire weapons from behind cover, which, while it has protection advantages compared to popping out of cover to aim, is horrifically inaccurate and only really useful when enemies are close enough that they would instantly kill you if you popped out to aim - the only two reasons you really have for doing so are to either suppress enemies (best done with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">light machine gun</a>) or to try and get CQB points to unlock new weapons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em>: Multiple:
<ul><li> In the first game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1">Borderlands 1</a></em>, at least two unique guns have a 0.0 accuracy rating, meaning that the process of using one involves pulling the trigger and, if used beyond point-blank range, praying fervently to your weapons deity of choice that any of your resulting shots hit a target. Both are shotguns and boss weapons besides, meaning you will <em>definitely</em> see them in use against you, and that being shot by them is probably not what's bound to kill you:
<ul><li> Sledge's Shotgun
</li></ul></li><li> Gaige's Anarchy skill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>. It increases your damage at the cost of your accuracy. Up to -700% accuracy without using a specific item. If you do have said item, at around -900% accuracy the bullets stop being ridiculously inaccurate and start being <em>impossibly</em> inaccurate. They'll take sharp turns in mid air, zig-zag, land behind you... Anything you hit will be either by pure luck or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">sheer weight of numbers</a>, but anything you hit will also <em>die</em>. Gaige herself comments on this.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>"God help you all if I actually <strong>hit</strong> something!"</em>
</div><ul><li> Several guns have accuracy ratings so low that firing them anywhere other than point blank with them is little more than a loud, entertaining waste of ammo. A Gunzerker who brings out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">dual</a> Bandit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">Spiniguns</a> will eventually start spraying large volumes of ammunition with only a relatively minor chance of actually killing anyone. And if you're playing as Gaige, here's some advice - use Jakobs Coach Guns or Vladof assault rifles. The former has massive recoil and gigantic damage, the latter has massive fire rates and therefore, not very good accuracy.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a> Zero</em>, both the player and enemies exhibit this trope when spraying with automatics other than mounted turret guns. Even the bosses, such as Mai Hem.
</li><li> The submachine gun in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII">Quake II</a></em> has recoil-induced muzzle climb (one of the first in a shooter to have such), forcing you to fire in bursts and "walk the burst" (aim lower than where you want your shots to hit).
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, where assault rifles spray wildly, submachine guns even more so, and even sniper shots in VATS frequently go wide from their target, especially on lower experience levels, after which you may gain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a>. The inaccuracy is much worse with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">shotguns</a>, even the Double-Barreled Shotgun from <em>Point Lookout</em>. You can even miss at point-blank range <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure">in rare cases</a>. Worse, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, miss shots will sometimes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">pass through</a></em> the target.
</li><li> Glitched to the point of hilarity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekTheVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekTheVideoGame">Star Trek: The Video Game</a></em>. The idea is that if either Kirk or Spock is downed while in battle, they can be supported by their partner to a safer location, and provide some covering fire in the process. Unfortunately, <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/tZ2X8PHAI6Y?t=45s">the actual end result<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is less "lucky shot by the injured victim saves selfless rescuer" drama and more "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a> meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagdollPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagdollPhysics">Ragdoll Physics</a>" comedy. The bolts actually start to fire everywhere <em>but</em> where Kirk is aiming in that particular instance. The enemy AI's inability to aim worth a crap only lends itself further to this trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry">Far Cry</a></em>, this is why selective fire weapons such as the M4 are best used in semi-auto mode at long range.
</li><li> One of the main gameplay mechanics behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> is that weapons have stats determining how accurate they are (how close to the center of the screen the bullets land) and how stable they are (how much recoil causes them to pull upwards). Attachments can be added as well to modify their stats, but for the most part increasing one stat means decreasing another, meaning that to make a gun stable under automatic fire, or heavily concealable for stealth, the player will almost always have to sacrifice any semblance of accuracy; failing that, focusing on high accuracy will usually impact the stability, requiring slow and careful shot placement because the weapon will pull up a noticeable amount with each bullet fired, especially in full-auto. The fire-mode-locking mods exemplify this further, with the one to lock a weapon in semi-automatic increasing accuracy while decreasing stability, and the one that locks one in full-auto doing the opposite.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnOfTheObraDinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnOfTheObraDinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> four seamen participated in the execution of Formosan passenger Hok-Seng Lau by firing squad for the murder that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Second Mate Edward Nichols</a> actually committed. Played straight when three of them missed, but averted when Seaman Henry Brennan managed to fire a gunshot that hit Lau... and was therefore labeled as a murderer. Surprisingly, of the other three who missed their mark and are not labeled as murderers, only John Naples (himself a murder victim) is rewarded for his valiant efforts, while Patrick O'Hagan and Aleksei Toporov are fined for other crimes such as kidnapping and attempted desertion.</span>

Compare with Assault Rifle T-Dolls, who fire with measured three-round bursts, resulting in <em>much</em> higher accuracy. It's possible to avert this by giving them red dot sights and adding accuracy-boosting T-Dolls to the echelon, though for most SMGs, maximizing accuracy contradicts their role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">evasion tanks</a>.

<div class="indent">A note on guns: what <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Darwin</span> (and pretty much the rest of the gangsters here) is carrying is an automatic-fire needle weapon, better known as a gunther or popgun. There are certain advantages to gunthers — they're extremely easy to get ahold of, they're cheap, they're light, they're recoilless, and their design simplicity means you really have to work at breaking one — but these are offset by their utter lack of range, accuracy, or power. Your best bet with a gunther is to wave it in the general direction of a target and pull the trigger a lot. Since this is how most gangsters shoot anyway, gunthers are the street weapon of choice.

<ul><li> The episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> where Peter and friends dressed up as the A-Team lampshaded this, which then turned into something like a deconstruction. When Peter explained to some loggers what they would do to stop them from cutting down some trees, referring to actions from the show such as driving them off a road, causing the logger's vehicle to tumble over only for them to climb out dazed but unharmed, the main logger explained how a friend of his suffered debilitating injuries from a low-speed crash.
<ul><li> Actually <em>averted</em> earlier, when a girl's cat is stuck in a tree, what does the team proceed to do? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">Unleash their full armament on the tree's trunk, eventually whittling it down enough for the tree to topple over.</a> They don't miss a single shot.
</li></ul></li><li> Several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> showcased this. It should be noted that at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCarrier">Spear Carrier</a> level character has been shot in scenes that would otherwise be pure examples of the trope.
<ul><li> Example: Two pissed off Black guys take semiautomatic guns, point it at each other (one is <em>directly against the cheek</em>, the other <em>directly up the nose</em>) and fire for about three seconds, completely missing.
<ul><li> Even when they were looking away while firing in sheer terror, something should have connected, unless they jerked the guns totally out of the way. Of course, it was used to demonstrate the idiocy of pulling out a weapon over nothing, and then unfairness (or prudence?) when a pair of cops plug them despite their having made up.
</li></ul></li><li> Example two: Ed Wuncler and Gin Rummy with semi-automatic assault rifles versus three Middle Eastern store owners with handheld automatics. None of the gunmen are hit, Huey and Riley took cover and are apparently OK, and the one policeman? He got hit, but he was OK because of his body armor. In fact, he managed to stand up and get shot again - and survived that, too.
</li><li> Another amusing example of this was the Gangstalicious episode, where Riley discovered his hero was not only not gangsta, but also gay. Gangstalicious' jilted ex-lover and his crew tried to execute a naked, tied-up 'Licious, only to <em>empty their guns from six feet away and miss.</em> The Latino banger in the group lamented, "Man... we <em>suck</em>."
<ul><li> In the same episode, Gangstalicious and his rival E-Dirt get into an argument in a club. They pull out their guns and... each of them proceeds to accidentally shoot himself.

Bullets coming his way seem to vanish into the aether milliseconds before they should rightfully swiss-cheese him.
<ul><li> In the comics the main reason Batman operates at night as well as the massive cape he wears are to cause this trope by having the darkness plus their fear cause the shooters be unable to effectively aim at him, the heavy body armor deals with the few shots that do get through.

It uses nearly every single clip of Shockwave firing his laser at the Autobots.
</li><li> In the latter half of the <em>G1</em> two-parter "Dinobot Island", the Decepticons not only succeed in hitting the Autobots, but essentially pin them all to the ground with a sustained round of gunfire. Apparently they just had their guns set to "ticklefight"... at least, until the movie.
</li><li> During the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">movie</a>, the Decepticons succeed in overrunning an Autobot ship filled with cast members from the previous series and are able to land dead-shot bulls-eyes on their opponents in what seems like mere seconds. Given that there are 20 years between the previous season of the cartoon and the movie, this would logically seem to suggest that after millions of years of war on their home planet... it took landing on a foreign planet to learn how to aim.

Instead of the popular "ready, aim, fire", "aim" was replaced by another word along the lines of "point your gun in a general direction" or omitted altogether. Rather than rely on any sort of individual marksmanship, massed fire was relied on to overcome these inherent disadvantages, and so a soldier was incessantly drilled and trained like an automaton to fire as fast as the man next to him.
<ul><li> Any attempt at accuracy was further bodged by the enormous amounts of smoke black gunpowder would produce. After more than a few volleys of men doing this, the battlefield was shrouded in gray-black smoke.
</li><li> The number one source of casualties in the musket era was from artillery fire, especially when artillery were used as giant shotguns firing canister or grapeshot.
</li><li> This trope was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, where newer rifles actually tended to hit what they were pointed at, with disastrous consequences. This was the result of infantry weaponry recently becoming more advanced and deadly, but the doctrine of their use was still based around that of massed volleys of musket fire.
<ul><li> The reason for the rather unsophisticated (even for the time) tactics employed in the ACW was that the armies consisted almost entirely of raw conscripts. Normally an army during that period would consist of mostly thoroughly drilled line infantry, lots of cavalry and very effective artillery. Furthermore, the chief mode of employ for line infantry would be to fire one massed volley at the enemy and then charge with bayonets. The point was NOT to spend much time under the enemy's fire. Because generals on both sides had mostly infrantry of at best suspect quality at their disposal (and the low quality and experience of the officers themselves made any coherent movement on the battlefield difficult) this kind of charge was pretty much out of the question. Most of the times it was tried it ended in complete disasters for the attacker, e.g. Pickett's infamous charge at Gettysburg. So with really no other options, generals in the ACW were forced to just line their troops up right in the opposing side's fire and hope their own men outlast the enemy's. European officers embedded with the american forces were appalled by what they saw, but there was very little practical advice they could give with the limited resources available.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This was actually an accepted strategy for naval gunnery for the half century from the first armored warships in the late 1850s until after the construction of the <em>Dreadnought</em> in 1906. Simply put, despite improvements in guns and propellants that allowed warships to shoot farther than in the days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a>, there was no way of guaranteeing that you could actually hit anything at ranges much beyond a mile or so. The initial solution was to fit large numbers of small but relatively quick-firing guns to supplement the handful of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFGs</a> carried as the main armament, because the more shells were in the air, the more likely it was that some of them would hit the target.
</li><li> Supposedly what separated First World soldiers from Third World enemies... although this has been unfortunately averted, and <em>not</em> simply by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">heavy volumes of fire that by chance happen to hit</a>. (I'm not speaking of "Black Hawk Down" either.)
<ul><li> Untrained militia in Islamic countries use spray and pray techniques. A lot.
</li><li> Third World fighters will also be stuck by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomStick">Boom Stick</a> effect, assuming that something that puts out more bullets faster than something else can will naturally kill anything without additional skilled input from the user.
</li><li> As a product of studies conducted since WWII, which revealed either the "reluctance" or "lack of skill" plus "shooting-under-stress" factors cited above, modern training practices for professional militaries now train weapon-handling drills into soldiers' rote-memory as a matter of course... though even with knowledge of proper aiming techniques, marksmanship standards do tend to suffer in nominal peacetime, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">bureaucracy and cost-cutting measures</a> often mean troops aren't allowed enough live ammunition or range-time to establish/maintain proficiency.
</li><li> Most First World armies now emphasize fire and maneuver and copious use of suppression fire. The reason a large portion of gunfire doesn't impact into the enemy is because it's not <em>meant</em> to impact into the enemy, but to force them to duck and cover to allow somebody to go around and fire into them at close range.
</li></ul></li><li> This was the subject of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonWhite">Ron White</a> anecdote. He saw a shootout on CNN where a large number of LAPD officers were firing on a man hiding behind his Suburban. After the shootout was over, the man still hadn't been shot. In fact, not even the Suburban got hit. (Actually it was a pair of Ohio State patrolmen who pulled over the Kehoe Brothers, a pair of white supremacists. According to Wikipedia, "In February 15, 1997, Kehoe and his brother Cheyne were involved in a shootout with an Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper, J Harold Harker and a deputy sheriff, Robert Gates, in Wilmington, Ohio. The Highway Patrol trooper had stopped their vehicle, a blue Chevy Suburban, for driving too slowly and erratically on the road and found the license plate and registration had expired; the brothers also failed to produce any driver's licenses. Chevie Kehoe, the driver, complied with the officer's orders to get out of the car but warned him against touching him when he tried to search him. The deputy noticed the trouble the state trooper was having with Chevie and stopped to help. As one of the officers called for a tow truck to impound the vehicle, Chevie suddenly began to dash back to the vehicle with the officers in pursuit. The officers had pinned Chevie to a patrol car and were trying to subdue him when Cheyne produced a handgun from his passenger seat and opened fire at the officers, allowing Chevie to jump back into the Suburban and escape. Cheyne himself fled into the nearby woods, where police searched unsuccessfully for him for the whole day. The shootout was recorded on the trooper's dashboard camera in his patrol vehicle and was widely broadcast in the media at the time.[22][23][24][25] Footage of the shootout was first aired in 1997 on FOX's World's Scariest Police Shootouts. Since then it has been shown on television programs such as Most Shocking, Police In Pursuits, World's Most Amazing Videos and Under Fire.")

</div></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a> in Northern Ireland, military intelligence agents and plainclothes police once got into a shootout due to mistaken identity. Over 100 rounds were fired, and no one was hit.
</li><li> The NYPD is quite infamous for its poor overall marksmanship, hitting what they shoot at less than a third of the time, over all ranges. The closer the range, the more accurate they are, but even then accuracy is abysmal.
<ul><li> Police forces in general tend to lag far behind military or militarized organizations in this: police are generally meant to do mundane things like direct traffic and ticket people that (usually) do not involve ballistic exercises. Police firearm doctrine absolutely dictates firing at center-of-mass until the person is no longer a threat, with the understanding that this is often coincident with the person's death or mortal wounding. Their typical poor marksmanship has a lot to do with the different conditions in which they're using their firearms - soldiers typically have rifles in their hands and ready to fire at all times, and rarely have a conversation with a person who inexplicably pulls a gun and starts shooting - and the understanding that their marksmanship is poor and their best chance is to focus on volume of fire rather than well-aimed shots.
<ul><li> Accuracy in any firefight is abysmal. Also, they don't train with their firearms as much as a front line unit would, which can be reasonably expected to be practicing, either in a simulation (EST systems are good for this), or with live ammunition on a more regular basis. The police are still far more accurate than most perpetrators though.
</li></ul></li><li> Another factor is that most police officers use pistols which are not the most accurate weapons in the world, comparatively speaking (modern 9mm pistol is only good to about 50 meters, while most assault rifles used by modern militaries can reach 500 to 600). In addition, police officers tend to use ammo with poor penetration power (to prevent bullets from passing through a target and into something behind like civilians) and relatedly trained to be concerned with what's behind their intended target (to prevent missed shots from hitting something behind their target like civilians). And lastly, police officers are also trained to try and talk people down from dangerous situations first with gunplay as a last resort or defensive option (for themselves or others) - even SWAT teams, typically much more heavily-armed and armored than the regular police and sent in when the perpetrators are highly dangerous, will prefer to subdue and arrest rather than kill.
</li></ul></li><li> This is one of the modern military strategies — powerful machine guns, operating on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> concept, lay down enough suppressive fire to keep the enemy in hiding long enough for air support to show up. Suppressive fire in general is expected to not hit whatever it's firing on — it's to force the enemy to not return fire, stop them from moving into the cone of fire's direction, or just plain scare them to keep their heads down. Suppressive fire is also generally utilized for the purpose of soldiers just getting closer and flanking the suppressed enemy so they can (very reliably at such ranges) shoot them.
</li><li> There are three main reasons for poor accuracy in a high stress environment: First, the instinctive reluctance for most people to use lethal force. Second, the stress itself ensures that you aren't steady while firing. And finally, recoil alone kills accuracy. As a note, Heinlein's factors to thousands of rounds to kill a single man are from studies done during the Second World War.
<ul><li> The training methods used by First World military forces to train accuracy involves a number of factors to improve accuracy.
<ul><li> First, instead of standard targets (i.e. precision bullseyes), targets such as the US Armed Forces E-Type silhouette are used. This trains soldiers to fire at human shaped targets. It also trains them to aim for center mass, increasing the likelihood to hit the target.
</li><li> Second, rewards for good performance on the range ranging from shinies to add to the uniform (or keeping the shinies, like marksmanship medals), to added pay (old method, still used for specialized marksmen such as snipers in some cases), to unofficial rewards such as a three or four day pass.
</li><li> Third, training to react to fire: You get shot at, you return fire if you can see the enemy (or know where the enemy actually is). This training method alone raised the firing rates to up to 95% in Vietnam. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2v0xp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2v0xp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2v0xp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">accuracy is not as important here as suppressive fire is.</span>
</li><li> Fourth, training in "accurate" un-aimed fire, or SRM. This is basically snap the weapon up, double-tap, snap it down. Ranges vary from service to service, but are designed to build the habit of bringing the weapon up and already having it aimed more or less towards center mass, without the aiming part.
</li><li> The final part is the stress-shoot. Using physical activity, and possibly other factors, such as explosive simulators (which can be loud for the Artillery sims), to force the heartrate up and shoot accuracy to hell. It is also timed, and you are graded on accuracy and speed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In his book on the Congo rebellion, mercenary commander Mike Hoare defined "reconnaisance by fire" as "firing wildly at everything in sight to see what's not there" — however he does note one incident where failure to use this technique led to his men driving into an ambush.
</li><li> The North Hollywood Shootout in 1997 was considered the greatest shootout in Californian history between the police and two heavily armed and armored bankrobbers, with hundreds of rounds shot during a 44 minutes period. Although about a dozen people were injured, NOBODY was killed except the two robbers, one of them actually committing suicide after he was shot and surrounded, though he reportedly received a potentially fatal hit at the same time he shot himself.
</li><li> The American M2 Carbine (a full-auto-capable version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>-era M1 Carbine) was still a standard-issue weapon during the Korean War. Soldiers who used it were suddenly very critical about a supposed lack of stopping power - in reality, most soldiers were simply missing with the majority of their shots, firing in full-auto beyond the weapon's effective range<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note36x85');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note36x85" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note36x85');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">that is, the range at which a weapon can reliably hit what its user is aiming at, compared to <em>maximum</em> range, which is as far as the bullet itself will fly before air resistance steals its lethality and gravity forces it into the ground</span>.
</li><li> In the Battle of Manila Bay during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar">Spanish-American War</a>, the American fleet fired some four to six-thousand shells at the (mostly stationary) enemy ships, and only about eighty to 141 (estimates vary) of them actually hit their targets, due to a lack of training and effective fire-control. However it was no less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> and the Spanish lost. To the American fleet's credit, when the Spanish flagship <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4mxlr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4mxlr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4mxlr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Reina Cristina</em>, already damaged by this point</span> attempted to ram Commodore Dewey's own flagship, it was quickly shot to pieces.
</li><li> "Project SALVO," a US government research program that eventually led to the adoption of the M16 assault rifle, encouraged this. Analyzing thousands of battle reports from the Second World War, the researchers determined that traditional marksmanship training was of little use in maneuver warfare, that the chance of being hit by small arms fire in combat was essentially random, and that the single largest predictor of success in a firefight was the number of rounds fired. Due in large part to the troubled history of the M16, the Project SALVO report is <em>highly</em> contentious, with many claiming it was falsified or based on faulty data, and many others claiming it was accurate, but suppressed due to the ground forces' heavy emphasis on the rifle range. The rifle it spawned would lose its full-auto capability, and gradually increase over time both weight and effective range.
</li><li> The United Federated Forces of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), a left-wing militant organization had <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbionese_Liberation_Army#Move_to_Los_Angeles_and_police_shootout">their hideout come under attack by Los Angeles police on May 17th, 1974<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The shootout that ensured remains one of the largest in U.S. history with roughly 4,000 shots fired by the SLA and 5,000 by the police...and even more impressively, absolutely no one was harmed by the SLA's gunfire or homemade grenades at all.
</li><li> In the course of a documentary, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Jeremy Clarkson</a> opened up on a (stationary, unoccupied) van from a couple of yards away with an AK-47 (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47">or something that looked like one</a>) and didn't hit it once. He would have done more damage if he had just flung the gun at it.
</li><li> On September 23, 1989, in the Hilltop neighborhood of Tacoma, Washington, resident Bill Foulk, a US Army Ranger Staff Sergeant, was having a cookout with several of his friends (also Army Rangers) and their families. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster">He and his party were attacked by local drug dealers in retaliation</a> for Foulk's attempts to organize neighborhood watch and protection programs, which included videotaping of a nearby "crack house". In a gun battle lasting more than 10 minutes, over 300 rounds were reported to have been fired from semiautomatic pistols, rifles, and shotguns; without a single injury resulting on either side. Foulk's party was not prosecuted for their participation in the shooting, as city officials deemed it a clear case of self defense. Their commanding officer was less forgiving, however, and ordered them to spend several months of extended time on the firing range for failing to hit their targets.
</li><li> John Haguee, the televangelist, will happily retell an incident, caught on camera, where a gunman from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">a "successful councelling session"</a> stormed his church during a live broadcast, pointed a gun at Haguee, and demanded he get on his hands and knees and pray to Satan, while denying the existence of God (which is ridiculous, since the official Church of Satan acknowledges that God created Satan). When Haguee refused, the gunman opened fire, and caused considerable property damage but failed to hit Haguee. Upon running out of ammunition, the gunman dropped his weapon and fled, right into waiting police officers, responding to the incident. Police forensics checking the footage and doing ray-tracing analysis concluded that Haguee <em>should</em> have been hit, repeatedly, and possibly killed. Haguee insists divine intervention for the fact that he was not.
