The phrase was first recorded in 1893 in the UK. The idea is that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingSalesman">busman</a>, to go off on a vacation, would take an excursion by bus, thereby engaging in a similar activity to his ordinary work.
</p><p>A detective, for example, goes on holiday. While they are on that holiday, a murder will take place in the vicinity and they will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle">forced to solve that case</a>. If the killer knows the detective is there, they're either very stupid, very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">arrogant</a>, or are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalMindGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalMindGames">plotting something big</a>. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorCrimeRevealsMajorPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorCrimeRevealsMajorPlot">something bigger than it looks</a>.
</p><p>This trope is much more likely than not to be lampshaded. Often, upon finishing the impromptu adventure, the hero insists on returning back to work immediately, stating he needs a vacation from his ruined vacation.

</p><p>The simplest explanation for this phenomenon is that a regular vacation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">would be boring.</a> If the main character is fairly low in his job's hierarchy (i.e. a beat cop), it can also nicely justify the utter lack of backup and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything">why a rookie is handling an adventure that should properly go to someone way above his pay grade</a>.

<ul><li> In the Terry Tate - Office Linebacker commercials, Terry tackles people that are slacking on the job or not following company policy in one way or another to increase productivity. However, when he is forced to take a vacation because he never takes a day off, he is so dissatisfied with the service at the hotel that he applies his usual work methods at the office to the hotel during his vacation. It works, as even the manager of the hotel says that production has never been so high.

Not so much justified in the <em>second</em> season.

The episode deals with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims">a murder mystery on an island</a>, and he comments at the beginning of the episode how mysteries seem to follow detectives everywhere. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then, it turns out that it was all fake, set up by Itsuki's Organization to keep Haruhi entertained. There was also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a> where we are reminded that Haruhi is not as much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryMagnet">Mystery Magnet</a> as the cause of them thanks to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> powers: because of the fact that she had been expecting one, there might now be an actual mystery criminal on the island.</span>
</li><li> Then later zigzagged in the "Snowy Mountain Syndrome" and "Where Did The Cat Go?" stories later. The SOS Brigade goes to one of Tsuruya's family winter retreats so that Haruhi can hunt down another closed-circle mystery. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Due to her knowledge that Itsuki had set up the "Remote Island Syndrome" mystery with his "relatives", Haruhi ordered him to set up another one for the winter retreat.</span> Everything seems to follow plans, until the Brigade goes out skiing, then getting lost in an abrupt snowstorm and stumbling on a mysterious mansion in the middle of the blizzard, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is actually a distorted data space created by a different entity than Yuki's Data Overmind</span>.

Then back to the Tsuruya retreat, where the intended plot unfolds. Despite the prior planning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itsuki even hunts down a cat that looks similar to Shamisen in order for his plot to unfold</span>, Haruhi manages to break down the headscratcher puzzle fairly quickly, and without much fanfare. In the end, the main event had very little supernatural and story depth. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itsuki even admits this to Kyon, citing that he prefers to be a side character rather than the mastermind, much to his chagrin when Haruhi insists that he also plan another plot for the next SOS Brigade summer retreat.</span>

The titular hero is always running off on some sort of situation in a far off, isolated place. Many times, it's people requesting his help. Many times, he's just trying to make money for his beloved mother. Inevitably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle">people start dropping dead. And the phone lines are cut</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> This trope is used to death in the series. It features multiple cases, often multi-episode, in which Ran, Conan, and Detective Mouri go on vacation, often to some sort of secluded manor or other such vacation home, and usually they stay with several other people. One or more of them is almost always killed and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosedCircle">manor is almost always cut off from the rest of the world for at least a night</a>, and Conan has to figure out what's going on. Ran's usually targeted in these cases, too, for some reason. It is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by police chief Megure.
</li><li> This is occasionally (but rarely) justified when Mouri is invited because he is a detective, and someone suspects something will happen. Ironically, in later adventures, his fame as a detective often gets him invited places where crimes are to happen by people who have absolutely no foreknowledge or suspicions that these crimes are going to take place.
</li></ul></li><li> The third story arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FAKE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FAKE">FAKE</a></em>, and the OVA based on it, takes place during Ryo and Dee's English vacation, during which they almost immediately discover a dead body. They actually do their best to try to subvert the trope—when Berkeley Rose, playing it straight, asks them to help him investigate, Ryo refuses and tells him that police work is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAGame">Not a Game</a>—but ultimately they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloneWithThePsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloneWithThePsycho">not given much choice in the matter.</a>

Almost immediately after their train leaves, the two are beset by Moriarty's thugs, with Sherlock coming along to protect them. Watson angrily assumes that Holmes deliberately led them there, but Holmes correctly points out that the thugs are specifically there to kill Watson and Mary. This pretty much obligates Watson to help Holmes complete his investigation while Mary stays in witness protection with Sherlock's brother Mycroft. It's even moreso this trope when you remember that Watson was dissolving his professional partnership with Holmes in order to be a proper husband to Mary, and was trying to do so in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmes2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmes2009">the first movie</a> as well, with Holmes deliberately setting things up so that Watson would be compelled to join him on the investigation.

And he usually finds them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Vetinari</a>, naturally is fully aware of this, so keeps sending him.
<ul><li> It's implied that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff">Snuff</a></em> at least, Vetinari purposely had Sybil Vimes force Commander Vimes to take a holiday, knowing full well what wheels would be set in motion.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth">The Truth</a></em>, in which William and Sacharissa eventually become so used to being reporters that, when they try to slip away for an afternoon, a traffic accident immediately causes both to revert to journalist mode. William suspected the ever-hungry printing press would derail their desire for a quiet break from work—not even a vacation, just a half-day—and (given Discworld's high narrative-causality quotient) he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">was right</a>.

<ul><li> God forbid they could take one vacation without babysitting, not matter how contrived. The sole exception was <em>Stacey's Lie</em>. Oh, and even if they went on vacation without Mallory's five-billion younger siblings or Kristy's step-siblings, then there would be some parents who for some stupid reason needed a sitter for the exact amount of time they'd be there.
</li><li> And in the mysteries sub-series, not without running into a mystery.
</li><li> They even <em>assume</em> that they will be taking one wherever they go, such as when Dawn goes to visit her dad in California and remarks that she may babysit for some of her old clients while she's there. You know, because their parents wouldn't have found new sitters since she left the state, and would be so thoughtless as to intrude on her two weeks with her non-custodial parent by asking her to work.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, every time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a> went anywhere on vacation, a mystery inevitably arose.
</li><li> Same goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys">The Hardy Boys</a>. Each franchise has over 500 stories, and a normal vacation isn't amongst them.

I demand thews!
</li><li> In the short story "Day Off", after securing a rare entire day to himself and planning to spend it with his girlfriend, Harry instead spends most of it dealing with the same kind of havoc he usually has on his plate, although of an unusually trivial variety, such as his werewolf friends getting supernatural fleas (for the record, it's of the "unusually trivial variety" because the story was written for a story anthology called "Blood Lite," in which an author challenged some of her sci-fi/horror writer friends to take a shot at comedy.)
</li></ul></li><li> Referred to by name in the Jonathan Kellerman novel <em>Bones</em>.
</li><li> Played with in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a> series. Roarke even uses the exact term when suggesting to Eve this might happen. One of Roarke's relatives does find a dead body, but the case is quickly solved by local PD, leaving no investigation needed by Eve.
</li><li> This turns out to have been invoked in <em>Hush Now, Don't You Cry</em>, the 11th Molly Murphy book. Molly and her police captain husband are invited to an important man's summer house for their honeymoon and their host is murdered. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They eventually find out that he had discovered his brother's criminal past and wanted a police officer there when he told everybody.</span>

When a local police inspector calls to ask for her help with a difficult case, he finds she's already invoked this trope by investigating, purely for her own satisfaction, a ghost story that appeared in the local newspaper.

<ul><li> Noticeably, the coincidental nature of the trope is played straight-on in "Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert," where Monk and Natalie just <em>happen</em> to be by the port-a-potties when maintenance employees find a body in one of them.
</li><li> Played straight in "Mr. Monk Makes the Playoffs" when Monk and Stottlemeyer go to a playoff game with tickets for the press box with Bob Costas (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself">As Himself</a>), but Monk discovers an attempted murder and a murdered quarterback <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight">Hidden in Plain Sight</a> by being dressed as a passed out fan.
</li><li> The tie-in novel series obviously takes it further, with several taking Monk out of San Francisco.

Whenever they're off somewhere fixing a garden- sometimes abroad, however much this stretches belief- someone pegs it, and it ALWAYS has something to do with their primary calling. It verges on the ridiculous at times, but never had something ridiculous in a verge.

It turns out the ghost was a keystone; he was cursed to roam for eternity for wrongly starting a costly battle, but after he's trapped, the others are awakened to restart their fight and threaten nearby villagers. After the situation is resolved, Ray learns the supposed executor of the estate was really working for his uncle's kinfolk and didn't warn the team of the curse to ruin Ray's chances of getting the estate.
