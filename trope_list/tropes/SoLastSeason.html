This is a necessary consequence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a>, but an awfully predictable one.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> featured this frequently. For Ichigo, his Shikai is useless as soon as he learns Bankai, and said Bankai is practically useless on its own after the arc where he first learns it as well.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in the Espada arc:
<div class="indent"><strong>Grimmjow:</strong> You use your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Bankai</a> and all it gives you is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">average</a> speed?
</div></li><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a>, Getsuga Tensho, which Urahara says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">would have taken his arm off if he hadn't put up his shield</a> and is used to completely blow away Byakuya's Shikai and makes a crater in the ground turns from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">spam move</a> after the Soul Society Arc, often needing two of them sandwiching the opponent just to mildly injure him. This is even after the fact Zangetsu stated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">knowing the name of the move</a> would strengthen it.
</li><li> Lampshaded in 270 and 271 of the manga; Ichigo manages to surprise Ulquiorra with his Hollow Powers and nearly blows up the room using his Getsuga Tensho. Ulquiorra can't even block it and gets caught in the smoke it makes. Cut to Nel celebrating that everything's okay... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">and Ulquiorra comes out of the smoke</a>, only slightly battered and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">missing a bit of his sleeves</a>. As the English dub puts it:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ulquiorra:</strong> I'm quite surprised. Was that it? Finished, Ichigo? <br/><strong>Ichigo:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe">It... can't...</a> <br/><strong>Ulquiorra:</strong> <em>(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialog">patting dust off</a> his sleeve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">nonchalantly</a>)</em> Hmph. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsBoring">Yes, it would appear it was.</a>
</div></li><li> However, unlike most protagonists subjected to this trope, Ichigo doesn't immediately learn newer, more powerful moves to replace the Getsuga Tensho, or even (except in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">one special case</a>) learn improved versions of it. He simply gets stronger and makes it effective again... until the next, even more powerful enemy shows up, which results in the cycle repeating. One thing he does (way too infrequently) to improve its effectiveness is, instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">firing the Getsuga right away</a> is leave it surrounding his blade and slice his opponent, then fire off the attack while his sword is already inside their body. This guarantees a hit and bypasses their defenses... but it's still the same attack.
</li><li> In the last arc, he <em>finally</em> learns a new technique... which is simply two of them at once.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> is one of the best examples of this. Every ten or so episodes someone makes a new generation of Knightmare Frame (mecha), which are completely capable of wiping the floor with the last generation, to the point where even the top-tier of the previous generation is woefully obsolete against the next-gen stuff.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>, early on the series one single Lower Rank demon of the Twelve Kizuki is a serious threat to Tanjiro and his friends, not so much to the higher ranking Hashira slayers, but still. Later comes the Infinity Castle arc where the nameless fodder demons are said to be enhanced into being as powerful as any Lower Rank was, said fodder were being effortless stomped on, in droves, by every main character at that point.
</li><li> Don't expect to have a chance against any later villains if the highest state you can evolve to in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> is Ultimate/Perfect, or have some new kind of evolution like DNA or Matrix evolving. And if under any circumstance you're not a main character and actually <em>can</em> evolve to the Ultimate/Mega level, expect to require Burst Mode to stand a chance against a villain of <em>any</em> importance later on. Oh well...at least you can be able to take on a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, because there will be <em>plenty</em> you can take on, just don't expect to be able to face off against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> by yourself.
<ul><li> It should be noted that most Digimon seasons, especially the earlier ones, put limitations over the use of more powerful forms (that is, returning to the In Training/Baby 2 stage, requiring time to re-evolve) so that the previous, less powerful forms still get some use. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Frontier</a>, early on, would show characters varying between Human-form Digimon and Beast-form ones. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Savers</a> played it completely straight, though - if a Digimon reaches a new level, don't expect to see the previous levels again.
<ul><li> On the plus side, in <em>Savers</em>, pretty much every "main" digimon was able to hit Ultimate/Mega and eventually Burst Mode - whereas prior seasons only had a few characters able to do this, resulting in the rest of the cast being reduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a> status. <em>Frontier</em>, <em>Adventures</em>, and <em>Tamers</em> were particularly bad (with up to <em>three quarters</em> of the cast unable to do <em>anything</em> in the later arcs.)
</li><li> Somewhat justified with Tamers, as half the cast got their Digimon in the second half (And one in the final quarter) of the series, getting Digivices only a few episodes prior to Takato managing to Biomerge, making it less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a> and just the secondary casts' partners appearing too late.
</li><li> Although largely played straight in <em>Fronteir</em> where Takuya and Koji take the center stage with Fusion Evolution, the rest of the gang do make the effort to avoid being left behind and remain largely effective for a long while into the series even if the higher evolutions have to step in to land the final blow. Once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">Unified Spirit Evolution</a> becomes a thing however, they end up experiencing this the hardest of any Digimon group, as getting Takuya and Koji into their highest levels involves leaving the rest of the gang literally defenseless without their spirits.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DinosaurKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DinosaurKing">Dinosaur King</a></em>: Max/Ryuta's Thunder Bazooka and Lightning Assault/Lightning Spear cards no longer work as finishers and are soon dropped, replaced by Plasma Anchor and then Thunder Driver. Assault/Spear gets it particularly bad, used in conjunction with the season's elemental armor, and yet fails to defeat a dinosaur that lacks the season's newly-introduced armor.
</li><li> This happens every time a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>.
<ul><li> One major exception is Tien's Solar Flare. Even the most powerful opponents can't defend themselves from a sudden burst of blinding light.
</li><li> Weighted clothing. First appears near the end of <em>Dragon Ball</em> as an effective means of showing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">I Am Not Left-Handed</a>, all but disappears by the Cell Saga. The idea of training in weighted clothing was replaced by training in artificial gravity chambers. Vegeta, for example, likes to train in <em>500 times Earth's gravity</em>, which adds far more weight to him than any amount of clothing could. Although, Piccolo still trains with weighted clothes and takes them off when he's serious. Also, in <em>Super</em>, one of Whis' training sessions for Goku and Vegeta involved sumo-like suits that Vegeta described as far more heavy than the gravity chamber's highest setting... and when thrown on the ground, it easily sinks <em>at least</em> a dozen feet into the ground.
</li><li> Goku's Kaio-Ken technique is almost never seen used by him after the first season, and his transformation into a Super Saiyan had all but obsoleted Kaio-Ken. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said that a combination of the two would have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">deadly</a> consequences for the user: the Super Saiyan transformation is already stressful on the body, and Kaio-Ken is significantly moreso, enough that so the combination of both would quickly burn out the body; Goku only manages to successfully combine the two in a filler arc where he's already dead and immune to the negative effects. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, he later learns to combine the Kaio-Ken with his Super Saiyan Blue form (i.e. going Super Saiyan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">as a Super Saiyan God</a>), since that transformation is calm and requires a calm mind to use. Even then, it's still a work in progress, initially having a 90% failure rate and throwing Goku's ability to control his ki out of whack after extended use of the combination.</span>
</li><li> The Super Saiyan transformation itself goes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">legendary and exclusive</a> to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessDecay">shared by a handful of individuals at once</a>, and nearly all of them have access to ascended stages beyond the standard grade. By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> rolls around, there's only one living character with Saiyan blood that hasn't learned to transform into a Super Saiyan, and she's an infant. The page quote references how late in the series Vegeta's young son Trunks is merely struggling a bit in the Gravity Room with him, and just suddenly decides to go Super Saiyan to run around more easily, shocking his father. Vegeta then becomes irritated when he learns that Goten, Goku's youngest son, can <em>also</em> transform. <em>Super</em> later justifies the lack of uniqueness when Cabba, a Saiyan from Universe 6, is teaching Caulifla how to transform into a Super Saiyan by revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">transforming into a Super Saiyan isn't some odd requirement of having a pure heart and righteous rage, but by condensing all of your ki into a spot on your back where the heart and lungs are.</span> This may only apply to the more evolved Universe 6 Saiyans, however. And how useful the Super Saiyan transformation is tends to vary depending on the person using it, which causes this trope to be played straight, subverted or zigzagged all together. For example:
<ul><li> Most notably played straight with Gohan's final upgrade in the series: once he attains that, he doesn't need to transform into a Super Saiyan anymore - and, in fact, supposedly <em>can't</em> (though he is seen in Super Saiyan form in works set after <em>Z</em>, due to not keeping up his training and needing the transformation to access his full potential).
</li><li> Like the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kaio-Ken</span>, Goku and Vegeta zigzag this. After ascending to godhood, they perfect their basic Super Saiyan forms and no longer need Super Saiyan 2 or 3. They can also merge their Super Saiyan forms with their god powers, creating a Super Saiyan Blue, which is basically a more powerful and stable version of Super Saiyan God. However their Super Saiyan Blue forms still tend to get overpowered which forces them to use higher transformation forms to compensate.
</li><li> The rebooted canon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Broly</a> written by Akira Toriyama completely subverts in not only the Super Saiyan transformation, but also the power of the Oozaru form. First Broly as a result of his mutant biology can use the power of the Oozaru in his human form which makes him stronger than Super Saiyan God Goku and Vegeta, while his Super Saiyan form is stronger than their Blue form and that is before he goes Full Power/"Legendary".
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with the Flying Nimbus. Even though they can fly at breakneck speeds and don't really need it anymore, Goku and his family continue to use it.
</li><li> Interestingly, the Kamehameha only gets stronger as the show goes on despite being the first energy technique used. It gets stronger as Goku's Ki rises, and although eventually it gets so high he's able to just toss raw energy around without needing to perform the specific focus and release technique, doing it anyway still creates a stronger blast than if he didn't, and it's still a lot faster than even more powerful techniques like the Spirit Bomb, letting it remain as Goku's go-to energy attack. The same goes for other attacks like the Destructo Disk, Special Beam Cannon and the Neo Tri-Beam as while they're not one-hit murderers, they can be used to clear the room of mooks or keep an enemy on their toes. The Destructo Disk is a special exception because there is nothing in canon that it can't cut through, so it remains useful even into <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, with its only detriment being Krillin's insistence on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">loudly announcing to his target that he's about to use it</a>, even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithCatlikeTread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithCatlikeTread">he's trying to surprise them with it</a>.
</li><li> One of the first things to go are the special melee attacks used at the very beginning of the series like Goku's Rock-Paper-Scissors or Yamcha's Wolf Fang Fist. While effective when it was all they had they're quickly made obsolete by even the basic ki attacks and are quickly forgotten about. Best shown when Yamcha trains to improve the Wolf Fang Fist for the second tournament and the upgraded version fails in it's very first and only use. Past around the midpoint of Dragonball they are flat out never used again, not even for an occasional comeback like obsolete ki attacks.
</li></ul></li><li> Just like with the case in fellow cardgame anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> below, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DuelMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DuelMasters">Duel Masters</a></em> was also somewhat guilty of this.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-zagged</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em>. Once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Pretty Cure Rainbow Bracelets</a> are introduced, it seems like the old Pretty Cure Marble Screw has been rendered obsolete (especially since it was already ineffective against last season's Ilkubo). However, Pretty Cure still fight without the bracelets sometimes, and are able to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Zakenna</a> and eventually even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Seeds of Evil</a> with the Marble Screw.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCureMaxHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCureMaxHeart">Futari wa Pretty Cure MaX Heart</a></em> starts out with the girls receiving their upgrades even before the "initial defeat" scenario could take place. Black, White and Luminous also got another upgrade in each of the movies.
</li><li> This was repeated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrecure5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrecure5">Yes! Precure 5</a> Go Go!</em> and in the attached movies as well.
</li><li> Characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em> franchise reliably get a similar powerup at the <em>halfway</em> point of the season. This is always associated with some new piece of equipment which is summoned into existence when the better attack is needed, and which incidentally is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">available in toy form</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula">Future GPX Cyber Formula</a></em>, the Asurada car series suffers from this so that there can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">mid-season upgrades</a>. The Super Asurada 01 model is the most advanced and powerful racing car in the end of the TV series, but at the beginning of the <em>Double One</em> OVA, it can't catch up because Sugo Corp. doesn't have money to do a proper upgrade. A similar thing happens in <em>SAGA</em>, at which this point Hayato's skill is nowhere to be blamed for his losses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> plays around with this a bit.
<ul><li> Following the acquisition of the Goldion Hammer, Guy's original finishing technique (Hell and Heaven) universally fails to get the job done if he has to fall back on it (ee the 31 Primevals or Zonuda). The reasoning they gave for Hell and Heaven's failing was because Guy's cyborg body couldn't take the strain of repeated usage. He still used Goldion Hammer after he got GaoFighGar <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his Evoludar body</span>, but once the Hammer's lost, his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">new body</span> is more than enough for the attack.
</li><li> Averted when the StealthGao II is introduced: the space-capable replacement for StealthGao also upgrades his Broken Magnum to Broken Phantom and the Protect Shade to Protect Wall. Both are shown to be ridiculously more powerful then the original versions (able to pierce armor and in one case <em>punch a moon to bits</em>). Regardless, GaoGaiGar still uses the original StealthGao when not in space, until FINAL, which gives a two-fold explanation for why this is - for one, StealthGao II actually makes GGG's attacks <em>too</em> powerful (Guy expresses shock when Repli-Mamoru summons it in the middle of a city, because of how much collateral damage it could cause, and he only uses it on Earth for the final battle of the original series where he needs as much power as possible). Even without that issue, there's also the use of physical Phantom Rings to boost GaoGaiGar's abilities, which makes Broken Phantom take much longer to execute, and can also be destroyed to render them unusable (as happens in said final battle). GaoFighGar upgrades to using non-physical Program Rings that boost its abilities without affecting the time taken to actually use them.
</li></ul></li><li> For the first two seasons or so of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD">High School D×D</a></em>, Issei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Balance Breaker</a> is considered a major trump card and only brought out at clutch moments with a major cost. Not long after that, it becomes his standard-issue battle form and the basis for later upgrades. Played with in that Boosted Gear Scale Mail was always supposed to be the bog-standard form of the powerup, Issei's just a rather mediocre Devil and needed various crutches to use it properly for a while.
</li><li> In the early parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>, Gon used a fishing pole as a signature weapon, Killua used special assassin skills such as a slow-paced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerSpin">Doppelgänger Spin</a>, and Kurapica wielded sword-chucks. Once they learned to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">nen</a>, their old gimmicks were quickly phased out.
</li><li> Played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em>, in contrast of the how useful special techniques are in the games because their power is partly calculated by the player's stat, anime version doesn't. Old shooting techniques don't work in the long run, and defensive skills are even more of the offenders, especially in the third season, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>'s uber saving techs can't save anything even a <strong>Sling Shot</strong> unless it's a newly debuted or upgraded skill, or his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot Blood Gauge</a> has just hit the roof. The exception is Endou's initial <em>God Hand</em> during a match with Dark Emperor, it's being used to stop shots inside the penalty area. Somehow, it's more effective than the two-tier-above <em>Mugen the Hand G4.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inuyasha began the series fighting only with his claws. Then he gets his sword, Tessaiga, and starts fighting primarily with that. Next he learns to use the Wind Scar, a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">destructive wave attack</a>, under certain circumstances. Then he simultaneously learns to use the Wind Scar completely at will (after which its use becomes at the same time much more common and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage">much less effective</a>) and learns the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">Backlash Wave</a>. Eventually, his sword is upgraded to gain forms that can cut through any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">barriers</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">except those that the plot demands be impenetrable</a>), launch a barrage of diamond shards, destroy/absorb an opponent's demonic energy, and open a portal to the underworld to send enemies directly to hell. Although none of Tessaiga's attacks ever become completely obsolete, this trope is still in effect, with each new upgrade or technique decreasing in actual combat effectiveness shortly after it is obtained (except the underworld portal, obtained near the end). This is most evident for the Wind Scar, which, when it is first learned, is talked about as Tessaiga's true potential to slay 100 demons in a single swing, but which, by the end of the series, is essentially Inuyasha's most basic attack. It's so bad that it's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> at one point by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">Byakuya</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Sesshoumaru</a> who are discussing Inuyasha as he fights.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sesshoumaru:</strong> Huh. Seems like he put another peculiar power in Tessaiga. <br/><strong>Byakuya:</strong> But it's as if he won't use it. Meaning for now, his best weapon is Kongousouha.
</div></li><li> Also somewhat present with upgrades Kagome, Sango, and Miroku get near the end of the series (A new bow, an upgraded boomerang, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">poison</a>, respectively... yeah, Miroku kind of got the short end of the stick there); these allow them to be effective in the final portions of the story, when their prior abilities were declining in effectiveness (for Sango in particular).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> The newly-vampiric Straizo in Part II can easily be read as a stand-in for Dio Brando of Part I, and the new JoJo, Joseph, outwits and defeats him easily. Then when the Pillar Man, Santana, is introduced, he escalates this further by consuming a vampire while also putting Joseph's Hamon abilities to the test. <em>Then</em> three more Pillar <em>Men</em> are introduced, all of whom have special elemental abilities, view humans as so insignificant that <em>they don't even notice when they consume one</em>, and, in Kars's words, make Santana look like "a loyal guard dog."
</li><li> The Ripple is rendered totally obsolete by Stands in Part III. In the manga Dio even mocks Joseph for surrounding his body with Ripple power, claiming that it may have caused trouble for him a century ago, but it's useless against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">The World</a>. Dio also ditches his ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">freeze people's bodies</a> and shoot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">vitreous humor from his eyes at bullet speeds</a> from Part 1 once he gets The World.
</li><li> Stands in general were meant to avert this, according to Araki. He was aware of having invoked this with Straizo, felt he had done all he could do with Hamon, and (especially after Kars ends his Part by becoming the series' first example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Story-Breaker Power</a>) didn't want to make Part 3's villains one-up the Pillar Men in terms of raw power. Enemy Stand users tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">puzzle bosses</a> that the heroes beat through developing their problem-solving skills, not through becoming more powerful or gaining new abilities. As a Part continues, its Stand fights tend to have more at stake and require more creativity, but the Stands are usually so different that the same winning strategy is never repeated.
</li><li> In Part 7, after all that build up and that intense final showdown with Funny Valentine, Johnny's new Tusk Act 4 is immediately rendered useless against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">alternate-universe Diego</span>. As he was made aware of his abilities prior to the confrontation, with this information <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diego</span> starts using the ability against him and ultimately defeats him. However in an interesting twist, the same could be said about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diego's Stand, THE WORLD</span>, because while the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">original World in Part 3</span> was such a juggernaut it had the heroes on the defensive during the entire fight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diego</span> on the other hand was forced to run away from Tusk Act 4 since it was pretty much the worst match-up against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">THE WORLD</span>, because Johnny is a long ranged fighter and Tusk <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">can move in stopped time</span>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">StrikerS</a></em>, Nanoha breaks out the Blaster Mode for the final confrontation, which increases the power of all her attacks and provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Attack Drones</a> that can cast spells remotely or allow her to cast the same spell multiple times, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">causes damage to both Nanoha and her device</a>.

If you were to consider each upgrade as a multiplier, he ends up about 100x more powerful than he was at the very beginning. Add his training to that, and in the epilogue story, he is so powerful that his Megabuster shoots bullets the size of small trashcans!

It is eventually destroyed, but only due to ZAFT going all out and sending an entire fleet to destroy it.
</li><li> Highlighted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>'s second season as to why Nena Trinity died. While almost everybody that survived the first season was bestowed new Gundams, improved GN-X machines, or new prototypes, she was the only character that was stuck having to use her outdated machine, the Throne Drei. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This ultimately was used in sealing her fate, but in Nena Trinity's defense, she couldn't get a new one as she was more concerned with actually surviving for four years, and she <em>almost</em> got a new mecha, the Arche Drei. Unfortunately for her, she didn't get it in time.</span>
</li><li> Downplayed in the case of Celestial Being. Despite building state of the art Gundams that are usually a step or two ahead of everyone else, they make sure all of their old units are constantly upgraded just in case they're needed, which is shown to be the case at various times.
</li><li> Mikazuki upgrades to the Gundam Barbatos Lupus in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>, after the Barbatos' original armor was deemed irreparable.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The characters often fall to this. The Sharingan is nothing short of badass when introduced, and Kekkei-Genkai in general are extremely powerful. By <em>Shippuden</em>, pretty much every major opponent had some kind of Kekkei-Genkai that made them hot stuff and it would take combined efforts to beat a villain.
</li><li> It's almost impossible to not mention the Sharingan in particular. It started as a fairly simple technique that allowed the user to copy the movements of the enemy, but then Kishimoto started writing in new abilities for it every arc or so, including a stronger variation that could utilize all sort of ridiculous jutsu.
</li><li> Somewhat zig-zagged with Shikamaru, whose one trick was shadow jutsu. What he lacks in power, he makes up for with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">cunning</a> - as all of his fights, even against Hidan (an Akatsuki member - the new standard for badass in <em>Shippuden</em>) revolve around him using his shadow jutsu in new and clever ways to beat opponents.
</li><li> Naruto's reliance on Shadow Clone Jutsu never wavers, but his finishing move changed several times. Originally Uzumaki Barrage was his signature move, but this changed upon learning Rasengan.
</li><li> In general, fights, which were once highly tactical and reliant on misdirection and anticipation, became flashier and more straightforward and destructive, as the strength of new jutsu kept increasing throughout the story and clever planning around troublesome abilities was rendered nearly useless due to their sheer scale.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> The main characters fall victim to this at times. Chopper gets hit <em>hard</em> by this once he starts fighting enemies he can't polish off in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower">three minutes</a>. And it's a rule that Luffy will always finish off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> with a new attack that usually becomes a regular part of his arsenal in later arcs.
</li><li> Gear Second and Gear Third used to have drastic side effects for Luffy (wearing him out and temporarily shrinking him, respectively). Come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, these both have become non-issues. However, even they aren't enough against Doflamingo, so Luffy has to follow up with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gear <strong>Fourth</strong></span>, and even that needs different varieties for him to apply later on to keep up with the rising threats.
</li><li> Pacifistas were practically unstoppable before the Time Skip, with it taking the entirety of the main cast everything they had just to bring down one, and only the strongest characters in the series yet to be shown faring much better. After the Time Skip, however, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji each demonstrate the ability to <em>one-shot</em> them. Justified in that the original Pacifistas they faced were outdated, and new, more powerful versions existed.
</li><li> Haki has thus far gone the opposite way, being more of a So <em>This</em> Season after the Time Skip. Before the skip, Haki was fairly mysterious, and only received occasional, vague hints regarding who could use it, when someone was using it, and it was actually doing. Just before the Time Skip, however, it finally received a full explanation, and it started to be regularly used afterwards, and Armament Haki even suddenly gained the effect of making anything it's covering look black and shiny to show the audience when it was being used.
<ul><li> Haki starts playing this straight once Luffy meets enemies that can utilize advanced applications of the ability. Observation Haki, for example, is normally only useful for foreseeing incoming attacks as it relies on detecting violent intent from an enemy to work. Then we are introduced to Charlotte Katakuri, who can just outright look into the nearby future, enemy intent or not, allowing him to not only anticipate attacks, but also unexpected actions and even spoken sentences from whoever he is interacting with.
</li><li> Armament Haki is a zigzagged example, as the small bits of it we see before the timeskip is the actual advanced application, involving the user creating an invisible aura that acts as armor. The black and shiny Hardening Luffy learns through the timeskip is in fact just one of the basics. He eventually learns how to perform an even more advanced application that involves essentially imploding the target through the barest contact, which was also shown pre-timeskip, albeit in a one-time, ambiguous instance.
</li></ul></li><li> Logia Devil Fruit powers, following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, have become this. In the first half of the series and Grand Line, being a Logia meant being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfAir">Made of Air</a>, as the power-user could turn their body into that element and let attacks pass through their body, the exception being Blackbeard's gravity-based Dark-Dark Fruit. The only way to fight a Logia without using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental RockPaperScissors</a> was to use Haki, something that wasn't well-known at the time in-universe. In the Grand Line's second half, the New World, Haki-usage is widespread, so, to quote another Haki-user...
<div class="indent">"Logia's convinced of their invincibility have short lives."
</div></li><li> Devil Fruits themselves started becoming far more complex and powerful as the series progressed. Even ignoring the aforementioned Logias, people with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Story Breaker Powers</a> became more common and rampant. At the beginning of the series, you had Buggy, whose Devil Fruit allowed him to employ basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetachmentCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetachmentCombat">Detachment Combat</a>. Later on, you have Devil Fruits that can manipulate anything as they seem fit within a determined space, turn victims into subservient toys that have their previous human identity promptly erased from the memories of those that knew them, or control vibrations to the point of creating world-shattering earthquakes and so on. Zoan Devil Fruits, which provide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Animorphism</a> abilities, were revealed to include subcategories like Ancient (dinosaurs and other extinct species) and Mythical (mythological creatures like dragons and the phoenix), both noted to be superior to regular Zoans, especially the latter, which are supposedly even rarer and stronger than Logia Devil Fruits.
</li><li> The concept of Awakening, while still relatively unexplored, is yet another case of this, as it allows certain Devil Fruit users to utilize their usual abilities in a far bigger scope. Doflamingo, who is able to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss">Razor Floss</a> from his body for a variety of techniques, can use Awakening to just turn the whole environment into threads and manipulate them remotely, surpassing the whole "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss">Razor Floss</a> from his body" limit of his Devil Fruit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>
<ul><li> Bulbasaur was one of Ash's most used Pokémon, and managed to defeat many mons which would have an advantage over him. When Ash battles a Chikorita (Bulbasaur's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">successor</a> as a Grass starter) with him ... he gets promptly beaten. Chikorita also manages to hold up against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAwesomeJustAddDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAwesomeJustAddDragons">Charizard</a>, which not only is fully evolved, but has a tremendous advantage in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental RockPaperScissors</a>. That is not to say Bulbasaur did not have later badass moments, of course.
</li><li> Somewhere between <em>Sinnoh League Victors</em> and <em>Best Wishes</em>, the Team Rocket trio decided their old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> status was So Last Season and returned in the new series having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taken several levels in Badass</a> to become so strong Jessie on her own beat the ever-loving crap out of Ash and his new partner's Pokémon using her newly obtained Woobat. They didn't blast off throughout much of <em>Best Wishes</em>, but this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">didn't last</a> into <em>XY</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a> often get to shine for one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a> and/or series arc, before being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessDecay">marginalized</a> for newer ones. The poster boy of this is Lugia; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000">first introduced</a> as a singular awe-inspiring, intelligent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> (and one of the first brand new Pokémon revealed), a Johto arc later diminished its significance by introducing more Lugia specimens, none of which had the power or intellect of the original. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonHoopaAndTheClashOfAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonHoopaAndTheClashOfAges">a movie chock-full of past Legendaries</a> quickly and unceremoniously boots it out early on to focus on the then-new Mega Evolutions and Primal Reversions.
</li><li> Mythical Pokemon in particular got brought down to earth in the <em>Sun and Moon</em> series, which broke the taboo against protagonists capturing them. Ash's Meltan and Mallow's Shaymin in particular are treated more like standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Kid Appeal Characters</a>, their elusiveness and power only fleetingly brought up whenever the plot gives them importance. In their earlier appearances they both had to be protected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Com Mons</a> of the group like Pikachu and Rowlet. Ash's Melmetal, after evolving, still managed to be a powerhouse, but held back by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">inexperience.</a>
</li><li> Pikachu's signature move routinely changes every few years for this reason. It was once Thundershock but then it became Volt Tackle. Volt Tackle was replaced with Electro Ball and then a few years later that was replaced with Electroweb.
</li><li> Mega Evolution gets this treatment in <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em>, with the exception of Brock's Mega Steelix; Misty's Mega Gyarados, Gozu's Mega Aggron, and Ilima's Mega Kangaskhan all suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> against Ash's Pikachu, Kukui's Incineroar, and Guzma's Scizor. The former two being defeated with Z-Moves, the new power-up of the generation, and the latter with simple strategy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> did this a few times, and spent an episode on each of the girls' power-ups. Generally speaking, you could predict when someone would get an upgrade when they were in an episode of a new season and had to fight alone despite already having their butts kicked in a team effort.
<ul><li> In general, Sailor Moon would be faced with a monster near the start of every new season that would basically be completely invulnerable to her attacks, so she'd have to quickly upgrade to a new tier to be able to destroy it. These same attacks were once decimating monsters and often doing severe damage to the leaders of the previous season, meaning that when you really think about it, a random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> from the final Sailor Stars season is in all likelihood much more powerful than someone like <em>Kunzite</em> from the first season, which shows how far Usagi and the rest have come.
<ul><li> Somewhat justified in some cases due to Usagi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">losing her weapons aside from her basic Moon Tiara in the previous season's finale</a> and needing to obtain new ones in order to be able to fight effectively. Though to be fair, she oftentimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers">forgets about the tiara as well</a>.
</li><li> In the original anime, Usagi is hit with this along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">Bag of Spilling</a> for the second and third seasons. In the second season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerArc">Filler Arc</a>, she discovers that she lost the Crescent Wand along with the Silver Crystal after the events of the first season finale and her powers slowly weaken before giving out completely, making an upgrade necessary. In the beginning of season three, the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> dodges Sailor Moon's Moon Princess Hailation, slaps away the Cutie Moon Rod and chomps down on the Crystal Star Brooch, damaging it and causing her to lose her powers.
</li></ul></li><li> The major exception was, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">unsurprisingly</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">post-first-season mini arc</a> where each girl got a semi-new attack that managed to take out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> <em>by themselves</em>. How two lonely teenagers growing a magic tree in their basement managed to make stronger monsters than the first season's demon queen sorceress is a moot point, given it never comes up again.
</li><li> Some of the characters did actually use their new attacks multiple times, later on. This was used to great effect at the end of the season when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> characters were able to negate all of the characters' upgraded attacks with virtually no effort during the season finale, even interrupting(!) Sailor Moon when she tries to use her teammates' attempt as cover for charging her attack. It knocks her out of her stock footage, for crying out loud</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> did this a few times as well. In particular, the first four chapters of the Dead Moon arc feature each of the four Guardian Senshi being targeted by the Dead Moon Circus and, though their encounter, getting strong enough to break Nehellenia's seal on their powers and upgrading to their Super forms.
<ul><li> The manga also inverted this trope with Sailor Moon herself, at least with the first two storylines, as Sailor Moon would push herself to the point where her brooch of the season would explode, only to get a shiny new one before the next major storyline.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Kazuma, the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan">Yakitate!! Japan</a></em> wins the first season breadbaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">tournament</a> in part by baking a loaf of bread so good that biting into it literally sends the judges' souls to heaven (which is populated by scantily dressed bunny-women). By the end of the second season this bread is dismissed as being woefully below the level of the current tournament. Fortunately, he quickly crafts a bread so perfect that a single bite re-writes history and brings the Judge's long lost parents back to life (allowing him to win - <strong>narrowly</strong>).
</li><li> Rarely will the characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> series use their old cards once they get a new/"more powerful" deck, one exception being Manjyome, who uses cards from different themed decks every duel.
<ul><li> Happens within the in-show card game in terms of what cards do as well. It's pretty funny looking at the earliest episodes and seeing everyone lauding a card that had 3000 attack points or five cards that instantly end a game compared to what later villains could and would pull out to keep their opponents from effectively battling at all, destroying their monsters instantly, negating their enemy's ability to deal damage, and so on.
</li><li> Being based on an actual card game, new versions of old cards are created almost every other set. However, since most of the originals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">were insanely overpowered to the point of disrupting the game</a>, the new ones are markedly less useful.
</li><li> There have been a few times that an old power-up was used, even when they have a new one. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Flame Wingman</a> kept getting played all the way to the final episodes, despite being completely overshadowed by Neos (though it doesn't get used as a finisher as much as it used to), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZexal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZexal">Astral</a> once used Utopia Ray, even after getting Utopia Ray V when the situation was more suited to Ray, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Majestic Star Dragon</a> is useful through its final appearance, though it does eventually get eclipsed by Shooting Star Dragon.
</li><li> A pretty textbook case of this happened in <em>ZEXAL II</em>. Heraldry Crest and Heart-eartH Dragon were the ace cards of Tron and Doctor Faker, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble">Big Bad Ensemble</a> of the first half of the series, and both required a lot of work to bring down. About halfway through <em>II</em>, Black Mist summons upgraded versions of both of them, along with his own ace, just to put up a challenge.
</li><li> Yugi generally avoided this during his run: even after he got all of the God Cards situations and rules generally kept them from making Dark Magician this trope.
</li><li> Notably, in the manga normal Yugi actually brings up this trope in-universe after beating Joey several times during their stay on the hospital after the Dungeon Dice Monster arc. At the end of the story, he basically become a living embodiment of this trope. In particular, the Ceremonial duel is a long string of this trope coming into play for both side, as it consists of Obeliks, the longest lasting of the God cards being destroyed in 2 turns and marks the first time an Egyptian God Card being destroyed in battle against a non-God card, Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl combination attack that beats Marik not being enough to destroy Silent Magician, and the Monster Reborn God card strategy that is abused against Dark Yugi by Marik and plays a pivotal role for Dark Yugi's victory the previous season failing to work at all. Conversely, Dark Yugi also manage to protect Dark Magician from Yugi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Gandora</a>. To date, the ceremonial duel is the only time Gandora failed to destroy its target for the remainder of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>. The Spirit Gun used to be like the ultimate Spirit Detective move, and Spirit Sword was pretty much the badass incarnate. Hiei's extreme speed and skilled swordsmanship were <em>really</em> something to be afraid of, and Kurama's cunning mind, Rose Whip, and ability to summon plants from the demon world were just as fearsome. But then later, Spirit Shotguns, Double Spirit Swords, reverting to your demonic form and pulling plants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">out of nowhere</a> and Dragon of the Darkness flames are the standard to beat... and who honestly <em>doesn't</em> have a sixth sense and some kind of Spirit Gun-like combat move or able to break the sound barrier by now? Averted by the end, when Yusuke's best attack was a really big Spirit Gun.

Tony Stark saves him by deploying the Iron Spider suit, which not only has a life support system but also a ton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">nanomachine-based</a> functions, and Spidey uses this suit throughout the rest of the film.

He was able to defeat Smith's physical attacks without even trying, then tore his code apart. In the sequel, the Agents have "upgrades," which for some reason requires Neo to fight them in hand-to-hand combat again.
</li><li> A similar occurrence took place in the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMightyDucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMightyDucks">The Mighty Ducks</a></em> film. Their new coach went as far as to comment on how their "their little duck tricks" (the knuckle-puck, the flying V, etc.) won't work anymore. It's especially sad considering how cherished these "little tricks" were for the trilogy's legacy. Strangely, this lesson was learned immediately following a game in which the Ducks' tricks DID work — giving them an absurd offensive output (nine goals in a hockey game?) — until the other team caught on and rendered them ineffective, then took advantage of the Ducks' lackluster defense to score nine goals themselves, ending the game in a tie. So their new coach was fully justified in telling them they can't rely on the tricks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharknado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharknado">Sharknado</a></em>, the 'nados are taken out by detonating improvised bombs in them to neutralize the winds.

Vali shows a similar progression, starting off able to use Juggernaut Drive under his own power, then Empireo Juggernaut Overdrive and Diabolos Dragon Lucifer after that.
</li></ul></li><li> We see this in action over the course of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series. The People's Republic of Haven is so much larger than the Star Kingdom of Manticore that the fight would be no contest if not for Manticore's superior technology. Of course, once the fight is actually on Manticore must keep coming up with new innovations as the PRH steals or adapts to the last one. Every time this happens, their entire pre-existing navies are rendered virtually obsolete and they must build up again from scratch. This happens ten or twenty times over the course of the series, but the biggest leaps in innovation are:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">FTL communication technology</a> in the form of grav pulses, which allows Manticore unprecedented visibility into enemy formations.
</li><li> Missile pods, which allow ships of the wall to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">completely saturate the field with a rate of fire never before seen in space battles.</a> Although the pods predate the start of the series, it's only after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a> that they become practical to use en masse.
</li><li> Ghost Rider project, which featured numerous advances into missile technology, such as ultracompact fusion reactors (which allowed unprecedented energy balances and thus a whole new classes of mobile decoys, penetrators and recon drones, as well as installing the FTL comms on them), multistage drives, improved stealth, advanced new missiles and drones, etc. In fact, the Ghost Rider was arguably even more of a game changer than the pod combat.
</li><li> Super-advanced LACs which serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">eggshells carrying cannons</a> that allow a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">multitude of small craft to deal out damage</a> each equal to a big craft, and finally,
</li><li> And then came Operation Buttercup, a Manticoran offensive that <em>combined</em> the new pod-oriented warship designs, new Super-LACs and their carriers, and armed this fleet to the teeth with the new Ghost Rider-based weaponry. Moreover, Manticorans managed to keep Havenites almost completely in the dark about all these developments, so when they were hit by the finally assembled new force, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">completely curb-stomped</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">Missile pods controlled by FTL transmissions</a> that allow the missiles to be controlled by their mother ships in nearly real-time and avoid defenses with contemptuous ease.
</li><li> In more recent books the Solarian League, having become complacent in the 500-odd years that no one could even <em>imagine</em> fighting it, sailed headlong into the results of the two decades of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Race</a> described above.

</li><li> Baptism is originally introduced as a dangerous surgical procedure that confers unique abilities. Even a partial Baptism, applied to only one eye, has an <em>eighty percent mortality rate</em>. People who'd undergone this were particularly dangerous. In a later volume, three characters undergo the procedure and all three of them survive. Not only that, but one person (without Baptism) manages to defeat them all singlehandedly.
</li><li> The Ragnarok are seven enormous monsters of legendary power. When one was unleashed prior to the start of the series, it took the combined armies of several countries to defeat it (and even they could only force it into hibernation). Midway through the series, small groups of elite Drag-Knights can permanently kill Ragnarok. Later on, there are characters who can <em>solo them</em>. This is lampshaded by one character, who points out that the Drag-Knights of today are not like those of the distant past, when Ragnarok were considered unstoppable.

</li><li> In the first episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> Netflix revival, Kinga Forrester reveals her intentions on using the experiment to garner huge ratings so she can sell it to Disney for a billion dollars. Her sidekick, Max, has to remind her that Netflix doesn't work that way as they don't use traditional ratings. The very next season has Kinga sweep away the plot point of her trying to marry Jonah by invoking this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> often did this to introduce the new mecha in the first few seasons. When there was no more footage for the old zords, they had to justify their absence and introduce the mecha from the newer <em>Sentai</em> footage, often by showing that the previous mecha wasn't able to keep up with the new enemies anymore.
<ul><li> Specifically, at the start of season 2, the Tyrannosaurus and Dragonzord were captured by the monster of the week, and the other four Dinozords frozen. While they were able to free them, new villain Lord Zedd immediately sent the main five Dinozords to their doom. Dragonzord survived initially, but the other five were replaced by the new Thunderzords. Dragonzord disappeared when the Green Ranger powers were destroyed, but he came back as the more powerful White Ranger with his new Tigerzord. The Thunderzords were destroyed at the start of season 3 by new villain Rito Revolto, and a few episodes later, they got the new Ninja Zords. The Ninja and Shogun Zords were simply rendered unusable when the Mighty Morphin powers were finally destroyed near the end of season 3. The Zeo Zord fleet was also never destroyed, but the Turbo powers and zords were described as more powerful, effectively making the Zeo stuff obsolete.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD">Power Rangers S.P.D.</a></em> accidentally did a "So Last <em>Episode</em>" concerning the SPD Battlizer.

Sometimes this causes the old robot(s) to not be used anymore, or only to be used as backup in <em>really</em> hard fights.
</li><li> In one episode of Zeo, a misfired effort by the exiled Zedd and Rita to turn one object into a monster results in a purse being made into a monster instead. Since using objects like this had been a frequent villain tactic during MMPR, Prince Sprocket is heard to comment 'A Purse Monster? That's SO last season!'

A kneeling, sit down, sit out, falling, turning, sideswipe, running, double, triple, turnbuckle, popup or whatever other variation you can think of is just fine but a regular old gut kick-grab-lift-drop power bomb is rare even with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NameOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NameOfPower">Name of Power</a> and usually restricted to use by only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrejudicedForPecs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrejudicedForPecs">exceptionally large wrestlers</a>.

A common angle is for the German suplex to stop working for any given wrestler, prompting them to train overseas and pickup/develop a more distinct finisher.
</li><li> The reverse Indian death lock remains a fairly popular move but the regular Indian death lock was all but replaced by the figure four leg lock popularized by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BuddyRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BuddyRogers">Buddy Rogers</a>, Indian and Amerindian wrestlers being the only ones still doing the regular version with any regularity.

However, the upgrades aren't always worth it, because they cost resources and the upgraded unit doesn't always gain much from it.
<ul><li> The upgrades that are <strong>really</strong> worth it are civilizations' unique Guard upgrades, for instance the British upgrade to Life Guard Hussars or the Dutch upgrade to Nassau Halbardiers, because those provide additional benefits on top of the standard upgrade bonuses.
</li></ul></li><li> While the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ApeEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ApeEscape">Ape Escape</a></em> game play this trope straight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">the Magic Punch</a></span>, <em>Ape Escape 3</em> averts it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMA">ARMA</a> III</em> has a form of this in regards to 5.56mm weapons. In real life those are what most modern militaries use, and they're still useful and effective. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted">In-game, however</a>, the two major modern powers (NATO and CSAT) have upgraded to better body armor that makes 5.56mm weapons - which indigenous forces like the Altis Armed Forces or FIA guerrillas are stuck with - as effective as peashooters, while they've moved on to bigger and better 6.5mm and 7.62mm weapons. This is particularly pronounced with the <em>Apex</em> DLC, which added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElitesAreMoreGlamorous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElitesAreMoreGlamorous">new special forces</a> to both sides, NATO's CTRG-15 and CSAT's Viper - the latter uses Chinese guns in 5.8mm with equivalent power to what their main forces use, while the former has downgraded to 5.56mm weapons again (albeit in part because the storyline of the expansion doesn't have them actually hanging around to fight CSAT, but rather a local crime syndicate).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoryAndMachine2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoryAndMachine2">Armory &amp; Machine 2</a></em>: For the first four areas of the game, the player's primary methods of high damage are Bomb, Bunker Buster, and Detonate, which deal Explosive-typed damage. Detonate in particular deals a whopping 150 damage at maximum level, one-shotting everything except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Big Glitch</a>, and it has a very short cast and recharge time. The fifth area in the Wilderness throws a huge curveball to players who rely on Bomb, Bunker Buster and Detonate, as several enemies there take a measly 10% of Explosive damage. In order to survive well, the player has to switch to either elemental or untyped moves to fight said enemies — even a humble knife or simply punching the enemy hard will deal more damage than a superpowered explosive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie">Banjo-Tooie</a></em> starts the player off with all the abilities that could be learned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></em>, some of which remain vital for progressing through the entire game, yet several of them immediately prove to be pointless in the new game world. For example, the first game requires the heroes to learn a move called the Beak Buster in order to pound in the many large buttons set in the ground, whereas the sequel allows those same buttons to be activated by simply stepping onto them, and later it becomes necessary to learn a more devastating ground-pounding move, the Bill Drill. Many of the new egg-based moves revolve around the newly-implemented first-person shooting too, and many of the new puzzles and enemies (particularly bosses) are designed in a way that makes the first game's third-person straight-shot ineffective.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> version is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Arcueid</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleMoonWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleMoonWars">Battle Moon Wars</a></em>. When Kaleido Ruby appears, she immediately designs a new outfit (specifically designed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantyShot">Panty Shots</a>), and <em>steals Caster's staff</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em>, one of the best plasmids, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Electro Bolt</a> is also the first one you receive. Shock a splicer and they're immobilized while you wrench them to death. If they're standing in water, shock the water and they die instantly. Hit a machine and it will be disabled long enough to run up and hack it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">And you can activate broken door controls with it too</a>. It's the most versatile plasmid in the game; never leave home without it. Also played straight in that it's less effective on later enemies and an upgraded "Electro Shock 2" plasmid becomes available.
<ul><li> If it's not Electro Bolt, then it's the Telekinesis plasmid. It costs almost no Eve to use, and it can work on pretty much anything you can pick up. Since the picked-up object gets flung, it can be used as a projectile weapon. Flinging the dead body of a splicer as a weapon toward another splicer is usually an OHKO, giving you "ammo" for the next splicer. Or just use that dead splicer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofHumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofHumanShield">as protection</a>. Either way, you're good to go.
</li><li> It's interesting to note that both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em> give you Electro Bolt as the first plasmid, but "Minerva's Den", the add-on to <em>2</em>, saves it as a later one. It's probably because the developers were getting annoyed that they were making all these nifty powers and players were sticking with the first one. Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite">Bioshock Infinite</a></em> has Shock Jockey, the Columbian equivalent to Electro Bolt, as the <em>fifth</em> vigor obtained in the game (though it's still universally handy).
</li><li> Played straight with Security Bullseye, which is basically useless <em>immediately</em>. That fourth plasmid slot is better invested in the likes of Enrage, Hypnotize Big Daddy, or Winter Blast. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bioshock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bioshock2">Bioshock 2</a></em> redeems it as "Security Command", where upgraded versions directly summon security bots.
</li><li> Likewise the first few weapons in <em>BioShock</em> - given strength upgrades your handy wrench is useful all the way through (especially for stealth kills) and the revolver remains an effective weapon - and a cheap and effective way to set off enviromental kills.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest"> Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</a></em> has two special weapons which do not require hearts to use, holy water and the dagger. What's notable is that while the latter becomes completely useless after you get the morning star, the former, the very first special weapon you get, has uses throughout the entire game (especially for pinpointing fake blocks), and in fact is required to get to Dracula.
</li><li> Jonathan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a></em> can't use the Vampire Killer properly, therefore it's one of the worst weapons to use throughout the game, even outclassed by the very first short sword you pick up. However, there is an optional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> where you can upgrade it, and it becomes one of the best weapons in the game from then on. Annoyingly, many of the mobility upgrades do this. You get the ability to jump on your partner's shoulder, then the better double jump like half an hour later. And then you get the super jump after the owl morph which allows you to fly, making the owl obsolete after like three uses.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow2">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2</a></em>, a certain boss <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Victor Belmont</span> uses similar moves as the protagonist of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow">first game</a> Gabriel Belmont. His final moves is to summon the same demon Gabriel could summon that instantly kills any non-boss enemy. Dracula <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aka Gabriel Belmont</span> simply summons the Void Sword and slices the demon to pieces before freezing and shattering it. The Black Knight also remarks that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Victor and the Brotherhood</span> aren't going to get far relying on antiques like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Victor's Combat Cross.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Used literally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChromaSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChromaSquad">Chroma Squad</a></em>. The player manages an independent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sentai">Sentai</a> studio, and your actors only unlock new abilities from their skill trees whenever a new season rolls around. Each actor gets a selection of skills from each season and can only bring one skill per season into battle. Luckily, you are not penalized by your audience for using skills from prior seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> tries to avert this. The player is expected to use ALL of their powers over the course of the game, and attack powers have damage that scales up as you gain levels so that level 1 attack is still very useful at level 50. Similarly handled in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em>. Since movesets are completely customizable, players are expected to make every power choice count. The conditions for unlocking some standard abilities, primarily passives, have even been lowered recently so that players will be less likely to have to choose powers they'll never use just to access higher-level ones.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> series, when a faction gains access to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">Mammoth Tank or its equivalent</a>, it tends to replace their basic tank because of how much stronger it is (a single Mammoth Tank in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars">C&amp;C3</a></em> can take on 3 of GDI's basic tanks and still win). Outside of the Mammoth Tanks, in more recent games, every faction has some advanced tank or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> that is stronger then their basic tank. However, using advanced tanks in place of the basic ones isn't something universally done, because they cost a lot more, and are very slow. Some people actually prefer to stick with the basic tanks and make up for the quality difference with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">greater numbers</a>.
</li><li> The first round of a map in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em> consists of entirely pistols, as both sides begin with a meager $800 (usually). However, a skilled enough player can still use a pistol to great effect even in the later rounds when assault rifles and body armor shows up. The most powerful pistol, the <strike><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47">Nighthawk</a></strike>"Deagle", can still kill an opponent with a single headshot except at very long range, and thus makes a great buy when you want to save money. Deagle, full armor, and some extra stuff? About two thousand dollars or so. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">AWP</a>? Almost five thousand dollars <em>by itself</em>.
</li><li> Like the above example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em>, properly upgraded, the plasma cutter can effectively remain a primary weapon (there's even an achievement for that) due to being highly precise, good rate of fire, and the ammo being extremely plentiful.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a></em>: The starting "laser" - even without any upgrades - does more damage per shot than almost every other gun in the game. Other weapons have a better rate of fire (allowing you to kill things quicker) and/or faster/multiple projectiles (making it easier to hit things at long range), but against easy-to-hit opponents that aren't so dangerous you need to kill them <em>now</em>, the laser is still effective, and is the most efficient energy weapon in the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> the humble pistol and riot prod, which you get at the very beginning of the game, remain effective until the very last level, provided you upgrade your character skills appropriately.
</li><li> Conversely, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> the player is expected to invest as little as possible in the starter skills and switch to using higher-tier skills as soon as possible. Unless the intention is to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a>, that is. Finishing the game also gives the player an option to start anew on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">higher difficulty</a>. On the Hell difficulty <a class="urllink" href="http://diablo.gamepedia.com/Difficulty_%28Diablo_II%29">(the highest difficulty)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> most of the monsters will be guaranteed to have at least one type of immunity, and some will randomly have two at once. So, for instance, if previously you were doing just fine with your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance">maxed-out long range Ice and Fire attacks</a>, now you may suddenly find yourself with a character whos almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">entirely useless</a> against a noticeable chunk of your opponents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> averts this by making some of the basic tier talents and spells (Shield Bash, Winter's Grasp, Heal, Stealth, Dirty Fighting, need I go on?) useful throughout the entire game, but plays it straight in the case of Shield Wall being unarguably better than Shield Defense and Shield Cover.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dragonica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dragonica">Dragonica</a></em>, the Anti-Air Shot is one of the earliest skills the Archer gets. Fast forward a great many levels and more than one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a> and many of your PvP opponents will still deride it as a 'Win Button'.
</li><li> The third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireEarth">Empire Earth</a></em> had a singleplayer campaign in which you conquered a worldmap via individual skirmish battles, where advancing to the next era could only be done on the world map. Your AI opponents put a very low priority on advancing to the next era, however. Against units of one era higher, the old units could still compete in sufficient numbers. Against two era's higher, they barely served as speedbumps. At that point in the game, there was no longer a need to build a base and set up your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandAndConquerEconomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommandAndConquerEconomy">Command &amp; Conquer Economy</a>: Your starting units could wipe out the enemy army and base easily. At the end of a game, your were fighting with sci-fi units that the medival peasants that your opponents fielded ought to worship rather than futilely try to fight.
</li><li> Ultimately sidestepped in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury</a></em> series. In <em>Fatal Fury 3</em>, Terry loses his fairly useful Rising Tackle anti-air maneuver in exchange for gaining the arguably more useful Power Dunk. By the next game, <em>Real Bout</em>, however, he regains the Tackle and keeps the Dunk. (Notably, his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em> incarnation never lost the Tackle in the first place, simply gaining the Dunk.) Subverted in the <em>Fatal Fury</em> OVAs. In <em>Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf</em>, Joe's Hurricane Upper turns out to be his saving grace in the battle against Raiden. However, in <em>Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle</em>, the upgraded form, Screw Upper, doesn't even affect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Krauser</a> in any way.
</li><li> Iron weapons in most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games may be weaker, but they're also cheaper, more durable, easier to hit with, and in many circumstances, enough to get the job done, even late in the game. Staffs are the same way; there are classy "mend" wands but the toy "heal" wands are almost as good in the hands of a skilled clergyman.
</li><li> As soon as the Shivans show up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace">Freespace</a></em>, all your past weapons become useless against their shields.
</li><li> Averted to a degree by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission3">Front Mission 3</a></em>, where the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Giant Robot</a> parts could be upgraded, and were generally a trade-off between several qualities rather than a straight progression.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodEater3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodEater3">God Eater 3</a></em>: The advent of the Ashlands rendered New Type God Eaters near-obsolete, as they have no resistance to the decay Ash particles cause, necessitating the creation of even stronger and more superhuman Advanced God Eaters. New Types can still fight in a pinch, but need a dose of modified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Bias Factor</a> first, which isn't exactly great for their health in the short term and will do god-knows-what over time. This is actually used as a plot point a couple of times; Claire (a New Type) has to be closely monitored and has a couple of health scares thanks to fighting so often, and remaining Old Types (such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Soma</span>) have been forced out of the field completely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, since the starting skills and spells are not particularly more powerful that the ones you learn later in the game. However it can be played straight in the case of other campaigns: If you choose to begin one with an existing character from another campaign you will encounter enemies with new unknown spells, since your character already has a set of spells learned on the original campaign and those spells were not specially designed to counter the new campaign's ones it encourages you to learn those new skills.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> has the player assemble the Pact, an alliance of the three powerful extra-national factions, to kill the Elder Dragon Zhaitan. The <em>Heart of Thorns</em> expansion starts with the Pact air fleet which accomplished this goal attempting to lay siege to the Elder Dragon Mordremoth only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">destroyed in its entirety within minutes</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, the often-overlooked secondary fire of the starting pistol gives it both a faster rate of fire and greater damage output per bullet than the SMG, at the cost of having to reload more often (the pistol's 17-bullet magazine as opposed to the monster 50-bullet mag that the SMG packs) and a decrease in accuracy. At close range, it can mow down marines and take out Alien Grunts with a single mag.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> series, almost every weapon you can get at the start is useful right to the end, though the rapid-fire bullet hose ones do usually end up being the least useful weapons. Even more unusually, the most useful weapon in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">first game</a> is commonly agreed to be the pistol that you get at the very beginning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a>: FAKK 2</em> presents a particularly strong version of this. After blasting your way through the first part of the game, act two sees you facing enemies far too powerful to be dealt with using your current weapons, the protagonist bluntly stating that she can't take them out, and it turns into stealth for the time being. Unusually for a game like this, you CAN kill them, but it takes far too much ammunition. Later levels turn these into pretty average opponents using later weapons, and turn earlier baddies into credible threats only in enormous numbers.
</li><li> Id Software's early shooters are a great example of this, to the point where all bullet weapons in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> are functionally identical, except for their maximum firing rate.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalDoom">Brutal Doom</a></em> manages to take care of the problem of the pistol in the original game quickly becoming useless by replacing it with an assault rifle with iron sights, who's precision compared to the spray-and-pray chaingun extends its usefulness for far longer.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</a></em>, Tia's frying pan, well known as the weakest weapon in the game, can do significant damage if used on high level slimes.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> series (by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a>), all of the weapons have their uses, and the pistols (especially when duel-wielded) were the best sharpshooting weapons in the game.
</li><li> A story, rather than gameplay example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Cool Starship</a> from the original game, <em>Normandy</em>, is replaced by <em>Normandy SR-2</em>, which is twice as big, packs a lot more punch, and comes with a ton of upgrades. Justified by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the original <em>Normandy</em> being destroyed by the Collectors in the opening cutscene</span> and Shepard <em>really</em> needing a much more powerful vessel against these new enemies.
<ul><li> Though <em>Mass Effect 2</em> does play this straight in terms of your weapons. For instance, the base assault rifle (the M-8 Avenger) doesn't deal as much damage as the upgrade assault rifle (the M-15 Vindicator) and isn't as accurate, with the Revenant Light Machine Gun leaving both in the dust, especially after you increase its accuracy. The base submachinegun (M-4 Shuriken) has poor accuracy, low firing rate, and low damage compared to its upgrade (M-9 Tempest).
</li><li> <em>Mass Effect 3</em> inflicts this trope on most of the weapons from <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. Of them, only the Widow sniper rifle, Claymore shotgun, and Geth Plasma Shotgun are really considered to remain excellent weapons. The Carnifex gets overshadowed by the new Paladin and Talon pistols, while the Phalanx, Locust, and Revenant are all heavily nerfed into being no longer worth using. And all the guns that were bad in the second game become even worse.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a>'s trusty Mega Buster fails him in the opening to the Game Boy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManV">Mega Man V</a></em> when Terra shows up. His charged shot simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">bounces off him harmlessly</a>, and after getting knocked out he gets the brand-new Mega Arm attack. But then, for some reason, regular shots, which also didn't work on Terra, work on him when you finally get to fight him. Go figure.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>, you can get through at least 90% of the game with the handgun, one of the first weapons you find. There is simply no better weapon for dispatching the numerous troops you encounter. The machine gun is at best occasionally useful, the remote missile runs out too quickly to be of much use (and is available in only one location) and <em>every other weapon</em> is good for taking out bosses and absolutely nothing else. Nearly every other game in the series continues this pattern.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em> uses this as the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>. The first boss, and essentially the first enemy that the player's required to give any attention to, is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Metal Gear RAY</a></em>, which Raiden coolly dispatches with a run-of-the-mill HF blade and a low-performance body. The boss fight after that, which is scripted to ensure the player cannot win, serves to establish cyborgs as much more threatening than any Metal Gear.
</li><li> In the games after the first Metal Gear Solid, no-kill runs are possible and generally your only non-lethal weapon is a tranquilizer gun given to you early in the game. The tranquilizer gun always has a unlimited silencer and enemy patrols don't raise the alarm when finding sleeping soldiers, so it's also best for sneaking around and no alert runs as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedUnderground">Need for Speed: Underground</a> 2</em> is a direct sequel to the first, and you have your powerful Skyline (best car of the previous game, and the one any player will be likely to own) smashed in the opening cutscene. With the insurance money you can only buy a not-so-fast compact. Subverted since some of the starter cars can be even better than the Skyline in the right hands. The worst offender is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk">Toyota Corolla GT-S</a>: a humble hatchback famously known in Japan as the "Hachiroku/AE86" that is actually <em>the best car of the game</em> that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD">surprise supercars</a>.

Chie goes through a similar cycle but at a slower pace, starting out with good physical and ice attacks as well as the ability to tank but her defensive capabilities and single target physical attacks start to lose their punch around the time Kanji shows up to pick up the slack and her ice magic loses almost all of its effectiveness around the time Teddy takes to the field with his much harder hitting ice spells.

<ul><li> Starly in the 4th gen games. It starts off looking like it'll just be like the earlier gen flying Mons (only to be used to fly around after a while), but it eventually evolves into Staraptor, a Pokemon that is very useful due to a powerful movepool.
</li><li> To an extent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PokemonXAndY">Gen 6</a> did this to Dragons. Before, only Dragon-type and Ice-type attacks are super effective against it while Steel-type resists Dragon-type attacks. Fairy-type, which is introduced in this generation, is not only super effective against Dragon-type but immune to it.
</li><li> In general while there are plenty of Pokemon who are useful at one point but aren't as the adventure goes on, there are plenty who you can get early and can be with you without much issue to the very end. Along with the aforementioned Starly and Magikarp, similar early season Pokemon that remain useful to the end of the adventure in various games include series mascot Pikachu, Ralts, Alolan Grimer, Shroomish, Riolu, and Abra.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002">Ratchet &amp; Clank (2002)</a></em> manages to avert this trope for most of the game, until you get the R.Y.N.O, at which point all the other weapons become obsolete. The sequels also work to avert this: though later weapons are inherently more powerful then earlier ones, this can be counterbalanced by the earlier weapons accumulating more experience and upgrades that boost their usefulness. Of course, this doesn't apply to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a></em> is a particularly egregious example of this... the weapons you get in the first half of the game that worked so well against the regular Ultor Guards become absolutely useless against the Mercs that show up in the game's second half. Instead, you have to grab a Precision Rifle off of the first Merc you kill and use that as your standard weapon for the rest of the game. <em>Guerrilla</em> zig-zags this. A lot of the weapons you start off with have their uses but are still mostly outperformed by later weapons, some remaining viable only for ammo counts (the demolition charges give way to a rocket launcher and then a rifle that shoots nanomachines to disintegrate whatever you hit, but the launcher and rifle only get a handful of reloads while you can carry a ton of charges), while others are simply completely outmached (the normal assault rifle getting an upgraded version that fires homing bullets, with negligible differences in ammo count). The sledgehammer, however, remains very useful all throughout the game for its ease of use, no ammo limit, and being an instant kill on most enemies even to the end.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robopon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robopon">Robopon</a></em>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Legend1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Legend1">Legend 1</a> rankings don't mean much in Majiko; the tournament there is for <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Legend1s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Legend1s">Legend1s</a> exclusively.
</li><li> Somewhat subverted with the Shofelds in the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a></em> games. A pair of starter weapons and relatively weak, they're still hit-scan weapons with unlimited ammo and decent for picking off individual enemies from a distance. While the Shofelds are <em>technically</em> superceded by the Tommy Gun and Sniper Rifle, the Shofelds are still good for mop-up duties if you're worried about conserving ammo for larger hordes of enemies (or huge, powerful enemies that the Sniper Rifle would be far more useful against).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfTheProphets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfTheProphets">Sins of the Prophets</a></em>, unlike the UNSC whose gameplay is built around leveraging the unique strengths of even the earliest-available combatant spacecraft, the Covenant tech tree is designed such that every new combat class available is a straight upgrade over the previous one, rendering the predecessor obsolete.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>, the Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie, are a popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> duo among the Inklings. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em>, however, two years had passed in-universe, and a new idol duo mamed "Off the Hook" (consisting of Pearl and Marina) have taken their place, complete with the same privileges the Squid Sisters once had.
<div class="indent"><strong>Marie:</strong> <em>(when her introduction fails to get a response from Agent 4)</em> You've never heard of me? For eel?
</div></li><li> A story-wise example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>. In <em>Brood War</em>, the Psi Disruptor was introduced as a secret weapon and essentially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Zerg</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">Kryptonite Factor</a> by blocking their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>, allowing the UED to take over most of the Swarm and leave Kerrigan considerably weakened until she managed to destroy it with help from her allies. As a result, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIIHeartOfTheSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIIHeartOfTheSwarm">StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm</a></em>, when Kerrigan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">comes for him</a>, Arcturus Mengsk has his scientists create a new variant, the Psi Destroyer, which uses their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> to <em>destroy Zerg</em>... only to find out Kerrigan has made the acquisition of the Primal Zerg, who lack a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> and as such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">are immune to the Psi Destroyer</a>.
</li><li> Particular averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration">Super Robot Taisen Original Generation 2</a></em>. While many of the prototypes from the first game like the Wildschwein and Wildraubtier had been put out of service and many custom mechs such as the Alteisen and Weissritter need an upgrade in the middle of the game, some units are still as powerfull as in first game like the SRX units.
<ul><li> Even more averted with some of the mass produced mechas. Particular the Gespenst II M, a basic unit used by the main characters in the beginning of the first game. With some upgrades, parts and a good pilot they can still be extremely usefull later in the game. This comes particular from the build in jet Magnum, one of the rare chain attack capable weapons.
</li><li> Irmgult Kazahara's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">Grungust</a>. Given to him early on in OG 1, and maintains usefulness all the way through OG 2 simply by being a well-balanced robot and Irm's criminally-cheap Spirit commands. Provided one gets him his Ace bonus and lowers his Spirit Point consumption, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">Love</a> Command becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. Increased movement range? Check. Assured to never miss a shot for the next turn? Check. Impossible to be hit the next time an opponent sends a swing at you? Check. A 30% increase in evading all attacks for the rest of the turn after that? Check. Take 1/4 damage for the rest of the turn? Check. Get a boost in Will so you can use better attacks sooner? Check. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Have your next attack do twice as much damage along with all the above, while costing only 1 extra Spirit Point in comparison to simply doubling the strength of your next move?</a> <em>Priceless</em>.
<ul><li> Generally in OG, with the exception of Alt and Weiss (and they didn't even need the upgrades that badly, they held their own throughout most of OG 2) once a character gets their signature mecha, it will be effective from then on. In OG Gaiden, nobody needed an upgrade from their OG 2 mecha, and the SRX team and Irm and Ring have been using the same machines since early OG 1. The only exception so far is Ibis, who's gone through 2 mecha and an upgrade throughout OG 2 and Gaiden, and still has yet to get her signature Altarion.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>: Before the 1.3 update, one could get through the majority of Hardmode with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Vampire Knives or Spectre Armor</a>, thanks to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life Drain</a> abilities. Then the 1.3 update came, and these weapons/equipment hit a brick wall against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Moon Lord</span>, who gives the player a debuff that makes all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life Drain</a> effects useless against it. Although there are a few ways to avoid its tentacle which blocks your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life Drain</a> abilities if it touches you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">so it isn't completely useless.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeShift">Time Shift</a></em> has a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example in the starting pistol. Between its low rate of fire, problematic accuracy, small magazine, and lack of regular enemies using it to drop ammo, most players will only use it to kill two mooks, probably through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PistolWhip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PistolWhip">Pistol Whip</a> rather than the less reliable bullets. Averted with the second weapon found, the assault rifle, which remains useful throughout most of the game thanks to its large ammo capacity, reasonable accuracy, better chance of knocking armor off a bad guy, and attached grenade launcher — it's actually a hard choice between it and the EMP cannon earned significantly later, mostly because the EMP cannon isn't as viable at long ranges. Inverted with the Thunderbolt crossbow, a sniper crossbow with explosive tips that will probably stay in your inventory when rocket launchers go flying around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters">TimeSplitters</a></em> is slightly odd as many times it inverts the trope, if one takes the various time periods as 'seasons.' Not only do the mechanical and futuristic enemies take a TON of punishment but future tech weapons aside from the homing launcher are somewhat over-specialised. As far as rapid weapons go, many death-matchers swear by the automatic pistol (fires as fast as you can mash, dual-wielded by a pro can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">fire FASTER than the Tommygun</a>, shotgun (which is preferred to the automatic if one is refraining from the weapon swap trick), Tommygun, SB90, and AK-47 rather than the sci-fi autorifle (fires slow then ramps up, faster it fires lower the damage), lasergun (must be charged to really do damage and people will hoard explosives if available just to get around the shield), and sci-fi handgun (The reflecting bullets are deadly, especially in the first where it is VERY easy to headshot yourself in enclosed spaces as it travels a LOT faster.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalOverdose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalOverdose">Total Overdose</a>: A Gunslinger's Tale in Mexico</em>, the character begins with a pistol and upgrades to more powerful weapons at about the same rate that he finds enemies to shoot them at him. But between mission stunt challenges train abilities that make the pistol more and more valuable. By mid-game the weapons escalation has peaked; the player is still upgrading acrobatic gunslinging while the enemies bring out more of the same. In the end, baddies can't keep up with the two-gunned wall-bouncing slow-mo triple-spins no matter how many assault rifles, explosives or military vehicles they send. Trope subverted: Pistols now <em>are</em> the heaviest weapons in the game.
</li><li> <em>Very</em> averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal">Unreal</a></em>. The Dispersion Pistol gets regular upgrades all through the game; by the final upgrade, it's as powerful as a weapon this side of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> can be expected to be... unless you use the (rare) power amplifier item. Then it'll chew through even the building-sized enemies in a few shots.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> properties of the upgraded (and amplified) DP were nerfed in a patch, as it could kill even the final boss in a few hits originally. Most of the other weapons also retain their usefulness throughout the game.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em>, you can, at the end of it, have an ancestral armor that was reforged, a steel sword that does +100% damages and ignore armor and a silver sword that does + 60% damages and has a high chance to disarm or stun your opponent(s), but if you import a save into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher2">The Witcher 2</a></em>, they suddenly become only slightly better than <em>what you get in the tutorial</em>.
<ul><li> Even more baffling when, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt">third game</a> you can get the silver sword back from the same person who gave in to you in the first game, and it proves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">hilariously overpowered</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> runs with this full-stop: whenever new ten man raid instances get introduced - a process which takes from 5 to 12 months - all loot obtained so far becomes inferior in comparison to newly introduced gear. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">PvP</a> gear vendors get updated with new tier of gear so it would keep up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment">PvE</a> drops. All previously purchasable gear becomes obtainable for lesser, easier obtainable tokens, new 5-man instances often get introduced sporting the same quality of gear as previous 10 man ones, and the difficulty of said 10 man instances is drastically toned down to render them accessible to the more casual playerbase. This process occurs 2-3 times per expansion.
<ul><li> As of expansions themselves, they represent a colossal leap in gear quality - for example, even the best gear from Wrath of the Lich King expansion for level 80 players becomes outdated compared to level 83 gear from Cataclysm. Character damage and health pools rise by as much as 3-5 times during the course of reaching new maximum level compared to the limit of the previous expansion.
<ul><li> The gear quality leap from Wrath of the Lich King to Cataclysm was one of the most egregious examples. The jump from Burning Crusade to Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm to Mists of Pandaria, weren't so dramatic, as people could still use their high-level gear well into the midway point of levelling. In Mists, even some gear obtained from dungeons couldn't replace heroic-quality gear from Cataclym's last raid. Especially the case for Trinkets, which are hard to come by until max level.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain items manage to outlive their purported quality due to being exceptionally well balanced, having no worthy replacement, or having an unique on-use effect. The so called Legendary weapons are purposely designed to last for the remainder of the expansion, as each is notoriously difficult to obtain and frequently involves a lengthy questline combined with running raid instances many times over. However, they often scale too well - for example, the spellcaster staff Dragonwrath had a chance of instantly doubling any harmful spell cast by the wielder. As this spell fully scales with all the caster's attributes, Dragonwrath would probably remain the single best weapon of all time if it wasn't eventually toned down.
</li><li> Skills and abilities, on the other hand, do not become outdated as they scale with characters' attributes (though before Cataclysm expansion, players needed to upgrade them manually at a trainer). The only exception are 'placeholder' skills such as Strike for warriors, which are baseline attacks designed to last until the character reaches level 10 and may select a proper specialization with unique abilities that replace it.
</li><li> Gear quality discrepancies is lessened in <em>Legion</em> with the introduction of Mythic+ dungeons, meaning that drops from the same dungeon get better as the difficulty is increased, up to a point they are only 10 or 15 item levels below that of raid gear. Raids introduced in this expansion still suffer from this problem, though, as they lack the Mythic+ difficulty setting. Emerald Nightmare, the first raid released in <em>Legion</em>, gives comparatively <em>worse</em> gear than Mythic 5-man dungeons, which can give comparatively worse gear than world quests in Argus, as of Patch 7.3.
</li></ul></li><li> The Omnigears from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em>.

But after Weltall is upgraded to Weltall-2, Omnigears lose a lot of their specialness. Weltall-2 is able to defeat the Vendetta Omnigear quite easily, Vierge is a match for an Omnigear despite being just an advanced mundane Gear, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Krelian's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">nanomachines</a>, Miang's Opiomorph, and the Seraphs of Deus have surpassed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> used to make the Omnigears</span>.

Up until this point all major villains had been Chinese in origin and Uncle was able to deal with them through normal conventions. The fourth season's villain however was Japanese and Uncle, not being Japanese or even able to read Japanese, couldn't use his regular spells on them. Luckily for him, he had a Japanese apprentice.

Both seasons also have the elves end up weaponzing Phuddle's failed attempts at cooking in order to fight off the villains, using a super spicy soup in the second season against Rixel and his dino-dragon, and a pink sticky substance that was supposed to be lemonade to fight off Dax and his bug men.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em> episode, <em>Mighty Pups Charged Up: Pups vs. the Copycat</em>, the pups try to use their powers to defeat the Copycat, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">has all of the main six pups' powers</a>.

In a subversion, he loses it soon after. In season 2 there's a notable <em>lack</em> of a mid-season powerup, despite the ever-increasing stakes; Spidey bemoans this.
</li><li> A variation of this occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em> where, beginning with the fifth season, the turtles would get new weapons and abilities, which would be discarded in the following season. Season five had the turtles gain the mystical Fangs of the Dragon and super-ninja abilities, <em>Fast Forward</em> had the turtles use futuristic variations on their trademark weapons, and <em>Back to the Sewer</em> gave them Cybernaut weapons and armors while in cyberspace.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>. The quantum surge turned some characters into Transmetals, granting them new weapons, new looks, and more power. Aside from the two Fuzors, new characters who showed up from that point on were also Transmetals... Until the Transmetal Driver was found and altered by Megatron, and the Transmetal 2s came into play, resulting in another round of upgrades and another look for new characters. Optimus went Transmetal, got an upgraded "Optimal" Transmetal form, and Megatron and Cheetor both went from normal to Transmetal, and then to Transmetal 2. Naturally, the final forms of all three were formidable presences on the battlefield, as was Blackarachnia, who skipped right to Transmetal 2... A full list of who was what when would be far too exhaustive for this wiki. Characters of either faction who never upgraded tended to seem slightly weaker as the Beast Wars raged on. Except Rhinox, one of about two characters who lived from the beginning to the end of the show without upgrading once, and remained awesome and invaluable right to the end. Arguably, everyone else upgraded up to <em>his</em> level.
<ul><li> Transformations in general. At first, beast modes served to protect Cybertronians fro. Energon buildup which would cause them to short-circuit in robot mode. Then Transmetals came around who didn't have this issue. To bring back relevance to beast modes, they were upgraded to include some mobility features such as thrusters or wheels, but this too became less and less relevant over the course of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> takes it a bit further than just making previous power-ups worthless: they practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenPhlebotinum">eradicated their existence without any real explanation</a>. The season 2 endgame featured the girls earning their Charmix (even prompting a line of dolls based on this new power up). Season 3, except for a brief mention by Alfea's headmistress, has completely forgotten about Charmix, instead opting to change the Winx's fairy forms altogether with a whole new power up, the Enchantix (hello, more dolls). And this is despite the fact that none of the girls get their Enchantix until the end of the 6th episode of that season, and there are quite a few big battles, including one against the series' perennial Big Bads, between the start of the season and the first Enchantix's appearance; such battles should at the very least have brought up a mention of Charmix.
</li><li> In the second season of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> TV series, the Guardians get an upgrade after the Veil over Meridian is lowered; four of the girls receive power increases and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, while Will finally gets access to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">elemental power</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quintessence</span>.

<ul><li> Things get a little simpler with Artillery techniques for the Franco-British forces:
</li><li> 1914: accurate Direct Fire over open sights (high gunner losses)
</li><li> 1915: inaccurate Indirect Fire at unseen targets (few enemy losses )
</li><li> 1916: reasonably accurate Indirect Fire at unseen targets (some enemy losses)
</li><li> 1917: heavy, inaccurate Indirect Fire at unseen targets (variable enemy losses) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18uni');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18uni" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18uni');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The prolonged, heavy firing techniques utilised since the previous year had worn out the guns' barrels, making them increasingly inaccurate. Sufficient replacement barrels were not forthcoming until the following year </span>
</li><li> 1918: very heavy, accurate Indirect Fire at unseen targets (devastating enemy losses)
</li></ul></li><li> It was around for thousands of years. The best way to counter the enemy heavy cavalry, the most expensive of all western European warriors, in the mid 1500s? Tercio pikeman, lad. By the time of the Italian Wars of 14941559, horses were just giant targets on western European battlefields. Of course, light cavalry (for more than just scouting purposes) hung around for <em>much</em> longer.
</li><li> Greek Hoplite warfare was unchanged for centuries, then javelins were deployed against the phalanx, which required cavalry so as to fend of the skirmishers, which were best dealt with using the Hoplite's spears. Then things settled down for a few centuries before the Romans developed their Legions.
</li><li> The atomic bomb is so horrific, its main use without going past the point of no return (what wasn't known when it actually was used) is as a weapon of fear. Modern aircraft carriers can carry payloads just as destructive, but spread out over the aircraft carried and the ships' own missile systems. Thus all that destruction can be a lot more precise without fallout and other horrific collateral damage. Thus making it actually usable, and a credible threat for many situations.
</li></ul></li><li> Happened to a comical level during the latter half of the Second World War as supplies began to run dry, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece">older cannons were brought back...</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">and found to be totally ineffective anywhere but the back on most newer tanks</a>. And the same happened with tanks, somewhat, especially for Germany, in order to have 'complete' combined arms regiments. They uparmoured the Panzer II with the F variant heavily, yet it still carried a measly 30mm which merely plinked off most anything it came up against. And it was horrible as an infantry tank too due to its long slender chassis not having enough room for many 'grapeshot' rounds or bullets.
<ul><li> Make that double <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun">for the Japanese</a>, who, despite having arguably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">most advanced destroyers in the world</a>, and not lacking much in the other ship classes, had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksForNothing">the land armor</a> that was on the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItBelongsInAMuseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItBelongsInAMuseum">It Belongs in a Museum</a>" level even <em>before</em> the war, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">and it stayed that way to the end</a>. Naturally, whenever they had the opportunity to engage in tank warfare, like in Burma or Manchuria, the Allies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">wiped the floor with them</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun">Katanas of the Rising Sun</a>... the Arisaka Type 99 is a good candidate for the best bolt-action rifle ever built, and the design was in many ways revolutionary (among other things, it was the first rifle to have chromed internals). However, it was still a bolt-action rifle at a time when the opposition was increasingly (or exclusively) using semi-automatics (the M1 Garand and SVT-40, respectively). The Arisaka served well as a sniper rifle, but as a battle rifle its time was over before it began.
</li><li> One of the major reasons for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> claiming so many lives was the <em>massive</em> dilution of talent caused by the fielding of such incredibly large armies relative to the pre-war pool of trained and experienced officers (just a couple of percent of the total!). The professional officer corps was well aware of how to make the best use of the available weapons and equipment, but the bulk of the men on both sides were commanded by bureaucrats, lawyers, and the like with little or no military experience or knowledge... initially. They learned, eventually - the hard way. Which is where this trope comes into play.
</li><li> The submachine gun proved its battlefield worth in the 1940s during World War II, becoming the main fully-automatic small arm of almost every major country's military<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2sm57');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2sm57" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2sm57');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Japan being a major exception; of all the significant Allied or Axis powers, the Japanese military seemed to always have a chronic shortage of automatic firearms</span>. From the 1950s through the early 2000s, even as assault rifles like the AK-47 and M16 displaced its role in the military, the SMG continued to be <strong>the</strong> gold standard weapon for counter-terrorists the world over and was a staple issue for many special forces units as well. Standout examples include such legendary weapons like the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 and the Uzi, the craze in the 1990s for personal defense weapons like the FN P90 and HK MP7, and less well-known but still effective guns like the Smith &amp; Wesson M76, the French MAT-49, and the Walther MPL. However, beginning in the mid-2000s, the SMG's &amp; PDW's time in the spotlight began to fade as CT units and special forces groups moved toward compact assault rifles instead. A combination of the spread of global terrorism, close-in urban combat, advances in gun &amp; ammo manufacturing, and further research into rifle cartridge ballistics have increased the popularity of carbines capable of firing much more powerful intermediate rifle cartridges like 5.56x45mm, 7.62x39mm, and .300 Blackout as opposed to submachine guns that are chambered for pistol calibers like 9mm and .45 ACP. In the American civilian firearms market, civilian-legal SMGs<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0747t');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0747t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0747t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Referring to submachine gun reproductions/modifications that are capable of semi-auto fire only and with a minimum 16" barrel to avoid violating federal firearms laws</span> have mostly been replaced by "pistol-caliber carbines" which are essentially rifles chambered in pistol calibers: this can largely be attributed to the resurgence of the 9mm cartridge, and more importantly, the massive increase in popularity of the AR-15 platform which can be easily converted to fire said cartridge in an easily controllable and customizable package.
<ul><li> With all the above, it is quite notable that the U.S. Army in April 2019 selected a submachine gun for its inventory: <a class="urllink" href="http://soldiersystems.net/2019/04/01/us-army-selects-bt-for-sub-compact-weapon/">the Brügger &amp; Thomet APC9K<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This marks the first time it will have an SMG since the World War II-era M3 Grease Gun was retired in the early 2000s. It still illustrates how far the SMG has fallen from grace: once being a reliable go-to weapon for intense frontline combat fighting alongside riflemen and armored cavalry, but now only good for close bodyguard duty. The fact that the Army is placing <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=e001bfaf6f293d0401029cd8052312ec&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">a tiny order of only 350 guns<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (with a provision for an extra 1,000) further proves the point.
