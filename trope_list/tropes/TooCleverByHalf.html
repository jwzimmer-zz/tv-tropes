</li><li> Know it, and are probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">pretty arrogant</a> (in fact, they tend to think they're even better than they are).

Usually they succeed (remember, they're really good), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">but their failures</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">spectacular</a>.
</li><li> Often suffer some impediment, or endure some prejudice, to the point where being dramatically and demonstrably more awesome than everyone else in their field is a necessity if they're going to be seen as a success at all.
</li></ul><p>Usually these characters are protagonists (though generally not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>); they're often the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool">Too Dumb to Fool</a>.

<ul><li> Sousuke Aizen from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> is considered the biggest mastermind in the series, capable of playing the entirety of Soul Society in his palm. He enjoys using his cunning to manipulate everyone, but he despises Kisuke Urahara, who is perhaps the only person who can match him in intelligence. His arrogance comes from his drive to break his limits, causing him to antagonize most of Soul Society because their lack of <em>exponential</em> growth pisses him off, as opposed to working with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> division and their secure protocols. Eventually, his minions and experiments break free of his control and one of them defeats him in combat - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ichigo, whose mother was genetically augmented by one of Aizen's infectious Hollow test subjects, something Aizen was too haughty to deal with</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sasuke Uchiha is a child prodigy and one of the few survivors of the all-powerful Uchiha clan. Even amongst his kin, he was pretty talented, if though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a> to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">The Paragon</a> of the clan, his older brother Itachi (though the two brothers adored the other.) Unsurprisingly both were the children of the clan leader (and he was quite capable himself.) However, after his brother exterminated their clan, he was left with a deep trauma which led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a>. Sasuke is very talented, but his need to be the strongest from this trauma and only beginning to recover from it leads him to making alot of really bad decisions. When he meets up against with his older brother (chasing after him when he learns he's going after his rival/teammate/ best friend, Naruto, he ends up getting defeated easily before undergoing the same psychological horror he went through as a child, being forced to <em>relive his clan's extermination in his mind for 72 hours.</em> When Naruto, who had always been inferior to him, manages to almost defeat him, it reinforces the severe doubts he has on himself and coupled with his greater troubled mind, he defects and begins the long road of being an antagonist.
</li><li> Kakashi's childhood self also ticks all the boxes. Another child prodigy (Chuunin at 6 and Jounin at 13), he was driven by the ambition of the mission above all else after his father committed seppuku for failing his mission due to saving his teammates. He had a relatively rocky relationship with his teammates, namely Obito Uchiha, and though he was genuinely brilliant, this arrogance got him badly hurt when he tested an unfinished technique on an enemy. This led to a series of events that led to the death of Obito, who's final gift to him was his Sharingan. As an adult, Kakashi remains haunted by Obito's death and we later discovered what happened to Rin, his other teammate: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she was captured by Mist village and implanted the Three Tailed Beast in the hopes of using her on the village when she got far enough. Kakashi was forced to kill her. Obito, who was secret alive, witnessed and it finally caused him to snap.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> Light Yagami is impossibly clever, charming and manipulative. But for all his great plans, he ends up falling victim to his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">pride</a> too often. By the end of the series, Light can't even consider the possibility he might fail anymore.
</li><li> L also has traits of this. He's confident enough in his abilities that he's willing to get <em>very</em> close to a serial killer that can kill supernaturally.
</li><li> So does Matt. He's the third-smartest of the Wammy's Kids, and very much falls into the category of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a>. He additionally gets a little too confident that he won't miss anything important going on at Misa's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and completely misses Misa and Mogi escaping with the help of a "delivery man", until it's too late,</span> and attempts to talk himself out of a confrontation with Takada's bodyguards <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which ends up getting him shot a million times over and killed as a result.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Lelouch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> is a brilliant strategist and turns out to be a gifted leader, but the higher he aims, the more he is prone to his goals going horribly wrong. By the end of the series, his paranoia and strategic cornering has led to the destruction of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tokyo, nearly killed his sister, and turned his army into the praetorian guard of a city-razing sociopath.</span> Luckily, he gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> about this trope and intentionally sabotages his ultimate victory to ensure that he doesn't screw things up after taking over the world.
</li><li> Seto Kaiba in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> has great confidence in his skills and is a genius who can create impossibly advanced gadgets while he's still a high-school student. He starts the series as the undefeated champion of Duel Monsters, but his arrogance earns him a beating by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>. He never quite abandons his pride through the series.
<ul><li> Apparently, this is the result of his childhood. After being left in an orphanage with Mokuba by their relatives (who spent their parents' inheritance), Seto set out to get the both of them adopted. To where he even challenged Gozaburo Kaiba, a brilliant but ruthless businessman and master chess player to a game and <em>beat</em> him. The whole thing impressed him to where he did indeed adopt the two brothers... and made Seto his heir, giving him ruthless training. Seto would eventually strike back at Gozaburo and claim Kaiba Corp for his own, but not before becoming a seriously messed-up young man who is haunted by the past and has a need to prove himself. To him, he can only move beyond his past by beating everyone in his way, with his final obstacle being the King of Games himself, Yami Yugi.
</li></ul></li><li> Sora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack//</a></em> is at the maximum level possible in The World, has the maximum possible stats, and goes around killing people for fun. Much of his arrogance is probably due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his age.</span> Apart from that, he also openly manipulates everyone and is essentially the most obvious sufferer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a> ever. He has information sources no one else has and is basically invincible in any of the fights he gets in, constantly killing BT. He gets called on it, but it never hampers him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until finally motivated into doing something somewhat heroic (he didn't realize he couldn't get away) and taunting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, at which point she turned him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>, and the show ended.</span>
</li><li> Taikobo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoushinEngi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HoushinEngi">Houshin Engi</a></em>. He's a brilliant strategist who once managed to save an entire village by getting them drunk so they couldn't fight an army that came to capture them and then killed the leader, causing the army to scatter. He's famous for manipulating most of the cast with ease...but the first time he met Dakki, he ended up being enslaved and forced to watch members of his clan get thrown in a pit filled with crocs and snakes, one of them calling him pathetic. His ego went down in size after surviving that.
</li><li> This is the reason why many former beta testers die in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>- they're unshakably confident in what they know about their game from their time playing the beta, to the point at which they don't realize that their knowledge is out of date until it kills them. Some specific examples follow:
<ul><li> In the first volume of <em>Progressive</em> and the second episode of the anime, Diavel becomes leader of the raid to defeat the boss of the level, and acts based on what he knows, intending to claim the last attack bonus so that he'll be at an advantage when it comes to deciding a leader. To that end, he plans on charging in when the boss is almost dead, puts his fellow beta tester Kirito in the back where he's less likely to get it, and, in Progressive, attempted to buy Kirito's Anneal Blade through an intermediary for another advantage. Too late, Diavel learned that the boss's new weapon in its second phase was different from in the beta, and paid for his mistake with his life.
</li><li> In a side story in Volume 8 of the main series, Kirito teams up with a beta tester named Kopel, who intends to trick Kirito into going into an area full of plant-like monsters, cause more to come, hide while the monsters kill Kirito and steal Kirito's gear once he's dead. Unfortunately for Kopel, he didn't realize that the plant monsters don't use sight to track their prey, which means that his Hiding skill is useless, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">he's the only player who dies</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>: Goku Black's plan to kill mortals and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> take over the multiverse as the supreme god</span> was nearly flawless outside of two major errors. He didn't seem to notice that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMindIsAPlaythingOfTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMindIsAPlaythingOfTheBody">Goku's body was corrupting him</a> since he didn't have the desire for immortality, only the desire for gaining more power. This error gimped Fusion Zamasu's immortality and made it possible for the heroes to destroy his physical body.</span> His second major error was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not coming up with a counter to deal with Zen'o outside of probably hoping that Fusion Zamasu could beat him.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: Caesar Clown. While not quite on Vegapunk's level, he is still a brilliant scientist who managed to develop several scientific advances, including (inefficiently) replicating Vegapunk's process of creating artificial Devil Fruits via his SAD gas. This earned him the patronage of one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Donquixote Doflamingo, who used his research to sell artificial Devil Fruits to one of the Four Emperors, the reputedly unbeatable Kaido. By doing this, Caesar was placed Doflamingo's direct protection, shielding him from the World Government, and Kaido's indirect protection, shielding him from everyone else. Finally, he hid himself at the barren island of Punk Hazard, which was off-limits from everyone due to being a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HailFirePeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HailFirePeaks">Hail Fire Peaks</a> wasteland, keeping himself hidden and allowing him to do his research in peace. Thanks to all this, Caesar had it made and could effectively do whatever he wanted. It was during this time that he would do several stupid things, the stupidest being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">swindling money from Big Mom,</a></em> another Emperor, confident that he would remain untouchable to even her. The problem? He didn't have Kaido's <em>direct</em> protection. Caesar's contract was with Doflamingo, who developed the artificial Devil Fruits himself using his factory in Dressrosa. All Caesar had to do was produce the SAD gas and ship it to him, freeing up his time to pursue his own research projects. This backfired on him. While Kaido has yet to be beaten, Doflamingo was defeated and exposed by the Straw Hats then jailed, and the factory at Dressrosa was destroyed, meaning Caesar lost the protection of <em>both</em>, and all the stupid things he did immediately came back to bite him in the ass.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler">The Riddler</a>, one of Batman's most famous enemies. He's a genius by any standards, far less psychotic than most of Gotham's criminal elite, and has even shown himself to be an excellent detective in his own right. So why can't he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">just put his intellect to good use and live a life of comfort and fame</a>? Because he would have to accept that he is Gotham's <em>second</em> most intelligent inhabitant. He NEEDS to prove that he is smarter than Batman, so he keeps needlessly challenging him and losing.
</li><li> Bruce himself is not above this, either. Two arcs ("War Games" in his own series and "Tower of Babel" in Justice League) come to happen because he made "perfect" plans (to take over the Gotham underworld in "War Games" and take out League members in case they went rogue in "Tower of Babel"), but was not as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> when it came to taking measures to prevent them from being stolen and implemented by other people.
<ul><li> To say nothing of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/InfiniteCrisis">Brother Eye</a> project. That went... poorly.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> is also prone to this. Being a multibillionaire who innovated, conquered, and murdered his way to the top of a multibillionaire empire wasn't enough. His motivation for ANYTHING comes solely from his ambition to prove that he can do what others can't — so in almost any continuity when he can't beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, but Superman can beat the brains out of him, he goes into a steady <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> as a result of his obsession with this humiliating reversal of his motives.
</li><li> In James Robinson's arc of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, the team is expertly brought down by a genius calling himself the Quiet Man. He sets the Thing up for murder, has the Human Torch depowered, causes the FF to lose both their homes and patents, Reed and Sue lose custody of their children and the team torn apart. He's been helped by the Psycho Man using the power of an alternate universe to manipulate everyone. The Quiet Man plans to have Earth invaded by this other world, all so he can shut down the portals and "save it" and blame it all on Reed. Reed dares him to go ahead, the Quiet Man giving the shut-off signal...and nothing happens, the attack continuing. As the Quiet Man gapes in shock, Reed dryly points out to this supposed genius mastermind that it may not have been the smartest move to give ultimate power over two worlds to THE PSYCHO MAN.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse">Mickey Mouse Comic Universe</a>, this is the flaw of the character Clarabelle Cow. She's a genuinely smart woman — certainly more so than her friend/rival/love interest, Horace Horsecollar. Unfortunately, Horace comes off especially bad against Clarabelle because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a>, so Clarabelle has an overinflated sense of her own intelligence, which leads her to doing foolish things.
</li><li> Happens all too often to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>, of all people: he'll start a new job, quickly become a master and then go <em>beyond</em> it, and then his magnus opus <em>will</em> ruin him due him not listening to the obvious suggestion that someone with less expertise (usually his nephews) will give him.
</li><li> Mystique falls victim to this in issue 16 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverines">Wolverines</a></em>: She's been manipulating the team almost from the beginning, and eventually gives up on pretense and outright seizes control of them from Shogun. However, even though she's firmly in command, she <em>still</em> can't dispense with manipulating them rather than being upfront about what her plans are and how they will solve everyone's problems (in issue 15 outright telling Sabretooth that the rest of the team isn't smart enough to understand). When she tries to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/X23">X-23</a> from helping Shogun and Skel rescue the rest of the Paradise experiments because she needs her (the other two are expendable), Laura balks at being controlled and triggers a mass walk-out by the entire team, who <em>all</em> agree to help just to spite Mystique (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">except for Laura, who genuinely wants to help</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out the rescue mission is a trap by Sinister. Had Mystique been honest about her intentions and not been so determined to manipulate the rest of the team — who she had control over, anyway — the entire situation likely could have been prevented.</span>
</li><li> This was the original characterization of Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a>. Although a legitimately brilliant scientist, his god-complex-driven ego outstripped even his prodigious intellect. His entire backstory revolved around the fact he disfigured his face because he made a flaw in an experiment's calculations, and couldn't hold back his ego enough to double-check it. Instead, he clings to his false accusation that Reed Richards sabotaged it, because he can't bear to admit that Richards was smart enough to spot that mistake before he made the experiment. Technically, this is still supposed to be his major failing, but after decades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badassery</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum">writers tend to present him as legitimately being as good as he thinks he is.</a>
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar">Mark Millar</a> book <em>Prodigy</em>, super-genius Edison Crane is approached by CIA operative Rachel Straks who needs his help. Claiming to have been sent by General Bear Thriftbank, Rachel says a vast conspiracy is afoot. Crane is able to figure out this is a sinister organization who's spent years trying to open a gateway to allow Earth to be invaded by another dimension. Crane is able to figure out the calculations for the gateway at which point, Rachel shoots him. She's the half-sister of villain Tinker and they gloat on how they've been using Crane all along. They note how her name is an anagram for "Charles Trask", the traitor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EastOfEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EastOfEden">East of Eden</a></em> and that the general is an anagram of Frank the Rabbit, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">Imaginary Friend</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko">Donnie Darko</a>.</em> They use Crane's calculations...only to realize too late that it's giving Crane full access to their systems which he uses to thwart the invasion. Crane informs them that he actually figured out the fake names early on. More importantly, the duo had gone to massive lengths to craft an elaborate fake background for Rachel...but missed the fact she couldn't speak Bedouin, which was a prerequisite for any CIA operative in that area. Crane lampshades how the duo's attempts to be so clever just tipped him onto their scheme.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EastOfWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EastOfWest">East of West</a></em>: Ultimately leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Archibald Chamberlain's</span> death.

He's able to pull off a lot of brilliance, but he always pushes it too far and eventually his plans come tumbling down.
<ul><li> Bob got his own turn at this in a Cattlepunk game. Bob somehow got his hands on a copy of the rulebook with lots of loopholes written in. Unfortunately, he not only badly overplayed his hand, he had the bad luck of the GM at the time being Brian, the book's <em>original owner.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Linus seems to have this trait in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em>. He often explains things using scientific facts and theories (most of which are true), quotes philosophers and the Bible, and often compares simple things to famous works of art. On the other hand, there are times when he acts naive or downright foolish; his well-known belief in the Great Pumpkin is mocked by most of the other characters except for Sally (because she likes him, though even she kinda finds the idea silly herself), Charlie Brown (who tries his best to be supportive, though even he voices his doubts), <em>Peppermint Patty</em> (who admits herself that she is kinda dumb) and on occasions, Snoopy.
</li><li> Jason from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> is incredibly intelligent, excels in school, and is an overall technical wizard. But he frequently does incredibly stupid things, potentially getting himself hurt or in trouble in the process due to being a ten-year-old boy with little life experience.
</li><li> Calvin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em> can be very thoughtful, imaginative and philosophical. Unfortunately, he's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> whose plans frequently go haywire. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">creations like his duplicates and snow goons have a nasty habit of turning on him</a>, he's regularly outsmarted by Hobbes and Susie in his efforts to prank them, and his schemes constantly backfire (e.g. by getting himself completely stuck when he has Hobbes tie him to a chair so he can be an escape artist). Like Jason Fox, he's a little kid without much life experience.

<ul><li> A large portion of the plot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/AlexandraQuick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/AlexandraQuick">Alexandra Quick</a> series is driven by the title character's tendency to do incredibly stupid things in incredibly clever and badass ways.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em>:
<ul><li> Harry combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>, having a tendency to overestimate his ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">Indy Ploy</a> his way out of trouble, and consequently takes a number of increasingly big gambles. This comes back to bite him, <em>hard</em>, in <em>Forever Red</em>, the first major arc of the sequel. His plan for escaping and leaning on the psychology of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Maddie Pryor</span> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust">Power of Trust</a> doesn't <em>quite</em> work as intended - he gets out, just as planned, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Maddie</span> doesn't quite turn as he intended, so he promptly goes after her. While this does get through to her, he still ends up getting tortured for two days, and their cunning plan to trick the Red Room and Sinister with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a> goes down in flames.

</li><li> Doctor Strange is a complicated version. On the one hand, he's more or less exactly as good as he thinks he is, being the premier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> in a setting so full of scheming that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/GambitPileUp/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/GambitPileUp/ChildOfTheStorm">has its own Gambit Pile-Up page</a>, smoothly manipulating everyone else, and he's aware that he isn't as omniscient as everyone assumes he is. On the other hand, he purposefully lets everyone assume his omniscience and rely on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee">Unspoken Plan Guarantee</a>, meaning that when he encounters a genuine blind spot in his vision, also during <em>Forever Red</em>, everything falls apart.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SoulChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SoulChess">Soul Chess</a></em>: Much like canon, Aizen, though in this case, instead of Urahara, the one he despises most is Lelouch. Aizen knew of Lelouch's intellect, having lost to him several times in Chess, and thought he would make a decent rival/adversary (enough to make Ichigo the "back-up hero"). Unfortunately for him, he never realized how much of a threat Lelouch was to him — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not until he enters hell after Lelouch uses his Geass on him and commands him to commit suicide. Even then, Aizen didn't learn about what happened until his apprentice enters hell with his lover and tells him</span>. After <em>that</em>, Aizen takes Lelouch far more seriously in every subsequent confrontation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RobbReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RobbReturns">Robb Returns</a></em>: Petyr Baelish is quite smart, and he knows it. However, used as he is to deal with nobles, he gets captured by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart">Street Smart</a> sellsword Bronn, who not only knows nobles even better, he also knows where Baelish would hide his secret books.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfic <em><a class="urllink" href="https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Dear_Tom/Dear_Tom">Dear Tom<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, the Order of the Phoenix is intercepting Harry's outgoing mail to ensure he's OK, only for them to suddenly see one letter Harry writes to Voldemort. The Order continues to intercept those letters but they become increasingly horrified as Harry appears to continue carrying on with the mail conversation, even though they are stopping his incoming and outgoing mail. Of course, Harry was just faking the entire conversation, taking advantage of their paranoia, so he could manipulate the Order into doing what he wanted.
<ul><li> Harry also slips a bit with this when he uses one letter to tell "Voldemort" that Snape is a spy, and Snape stops answering to Voldemort's calls because he fears he will be killed as soon as he does. When Harry finally reveals his gambit and demonstrates that they were duped, Snape realizes he <em>really</em> cannot continue to spy for Dumbledore.

He understands, on an intellectual level, that women find him attractive because of his looks (like the <em>many</em> fangirls he has at Ashford), interesting because of his mind, or consider him someone they can ally themselves with because of what they stand to gain from it thanks to his manipulation skills. However, he has a hard time wrapping his head around the concept that some of them may simply like like him. A half-amused, half-exasperated C.C., in particular, had to go into a sarcasm-saturated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveGotToBeKiddingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveGotToBeKiddingMe">You Have Got to Be Kidding Me!</a> rant just so he could start to see why she might want to blur the line between business and pleasure in their partnership.

He's a sharp planner able to outwit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Valmont</a> when needed and will always massively stack the deck in his favor during any upfront confrontation, nullifying any opposition he may encounter. The problem is that he always insists on a head-on fight to further his goals and his plans are based on what he knows he will be facing rather than on what he could be facing down the line. He's always shortsighted about how he does things, meaning he'll get tripped up the second something outside of his plans gets introduced.
</li><li> Willow in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Xendra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Xendra">Xendra</a></em> knows full well that she's both a certified genius and an extremely powerful witch, which results in her implementing many of her ideas without consulting anyone first.

She <em>is</em> a legitimately smart and skilled strategist in battle, but her victories made her overconfident to the point she actually thought she couldn't lose to any opponent. Her loss to future Elite Four member Phoebe is largely due to the fact that Katie did not anticipate that her opponent would also make her own plans to battle her, outwitting her preparations by throwing her off.

<ul><li> Before encountering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> Artemis Fowl, the fairies had basically assumed that humans were too primitive and stupid to see through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a>, in which they use ancient magic and advanced technology to hide themselves from humans while mostly living in underground cities. They had gone into hiding in the first place because humans would be too bloodthirsty and numerous to hold back if they all attacked at once, but since the humans no longer believe in fairies and lack the means to detect them, the Lower Elements Police recon force (LEP recon) only has to deal with occasional incidents where humans are exposed to fairy folk by accident, which can be safely contained with cover-ups and mind-wipes. As a result they are blindsided in the first book when Artemis manages to deduce their real existence from world mythology and unexplained phenomeona, extort a copy of the fairies' book of magical secrets from a fairy exile living in Vietnam, decode the ancient language it's written in, and use the knowledge it contains to kidnap LEP recon member Holly Short and demand a ransom of one metric ton of gold while defending the Fowl manor against the forces sent to rescue her. Even though it's just Artemis and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a> holding Holly captive, the fairies's best forces are initially unable to deal with their foes being able to do things like resist being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick">mesmerized</a>, see through the "shielding" ability which normally makes them invisible to humans, and exploit their magically-enforced inability to enter a human dwelling without permission. They have to resort to more outside-the-box tactics in order to wrest the upper hand back from Artemis, and while they do manage to get Holly back, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the end Artemis manages to survive the Bio-Bomb and keep half of the gold</span>.
</li><li> Artemis is introduced as a criminal genius even from the age of 12, and at thirteen he's already done enough to earn an active file from Interpol. He's hopelessly bored in school because all the subjects are too easy for him, and he has no friends his age because he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a>. His genius is more than demonstrated in the first book as described above. Unfortunately he has a tendency to underestimate his opponents and press his advantage too hard when he thinks he's got them in a vise, to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">Bullying a Dragon</a>.

Artemis doesn't even offer to sell the Cube to Spiro; instead he's asking Spiro to pay him just to delay the release by two years and have enough time to get his money out. Even though Spiro is a powerful man alleged to have connections with the Mafia, it doesn't occur to Artemis that Spiro might just take the Cube by force since he's got Butler guarding him, they're in a public venue full of witnesses, and the Cube is encrypted with the titular Eternity Code which only Artemis has the key for. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that all of the customers at the restaurant are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns">Hired Guns</a> on Spiro's payroll, and given his company's vast resources he figures he could break the encryption given enough time. Butler gets shot and left for dead, while Spiro makes off with the Cube</span>.
</li><li> Recurring villain Opal Koboi is a genius to rival Foaley, having invented the Double-Dex wing design and become a powerful tech CEO despite the prevalence of sexism in fairy society. In the fourth book she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has her ears surgically rounded and a human pituitary gland implanted in her head so she can pass for human, hoping to make herself the humans' ruler by leading them in war against the fairies. The pituitary gland also happens to drain her fairy magic, but she arrogantly proclaims that magic is of no use to her, and that she will rely on science instead. After being thwarted by the protagonists, she inadvertently uses up the last of her magic on a <em>mesmer</em> to convince an old Italian widow that she is her daughter and that she works with her on the farm. When Opal realizes her mistake in volunteering for manual labor and tries to backtrack, it fails so miserably that she's actually happy to get arrested by the LEP a week later.</span>

He spends his life running elaborate (and usually successful) cons on nobles while posing as a petty thief. The end of the second book covers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a massive failure; he's spent the entire book on a plot to rob a casino, and it goes off flawlessly — except that the paintings he steals are fakes, put out for the express purpose of being stolen.</span>

A child prodigy, he talks his way into his world's premier university at the age of fifteen, after having spent three years as a beggar, and promptly antagonizes both one of the masters and the wealthiest and most politically connected student in the university. Between that and his perpetual poverty, he spends most of his time doing absurd things (learning an entire language in a day and a half, getting certified as a musician on a lute with a broken string) just to keep his head above water.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTrickster">Tyrion Lannister</a>. Oh, boy. As a dwarf with a full-sized, functioning intellect, it's quite literally the case for him... and unlike some on this list, he's fully aware that he's pushing his luck in <em>most</em> of the stunts he pulls. Yet pull (and pay) for them he still does.
</li><li> Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish is described using this exact phrase by Ned Stark. He is, however, an unusual example of this trope because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (so far) he has gone from strength to strength without anything more serious than some minor setbacks, to which he quickly adapts. It helps that nobody has any idea what his actual goals are.</span>
</li><li> Give Ramsay Bolton some due: when he has to pull a fast one, he's really, really good at engineering out-of-the-box and horrifically clever solutions involving such things as impersonations, surprise backstabbing and completely outplaying people who don't think as psychopathically as he does. Which snowballs on both his father and him in terrible ways, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> most of the North would quite cheerfully see them both dead for how they have betrayed the Starks, among other things.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Grand Admiral Thrawn of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a>, especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a></em>. He'd probably claim that he's not arrogant, and it's true that he has no qualms about accepting a good idea just because it's not his, but he definitely has an ego underneath his self-control. He's an alien in a xenophobic Empire whose talents caused him to get that rank. His main problems are not leaving wiggle room for unknown unknowns and putting entirely to much trust in people he's manipulated both staying manipulated and making good decisions. To a lesser extent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker">Talon Karrde</a>.

However when in the field, he is quite cautious, unlike his replacement.
</li><li> Castin falls to this in a much worse fashion <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he opens an access panel without scanning it first, triggering a hidden layer—which ultimately led to his death. Grinder had previously dealt with a similar system, so he had the foresight to scan it before opening it.</span>

<ul><li> Hermione is the smartest person in her classes and perhaps the smartest witch of her generation. However, she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">discriminated against for being a muggle-born</a>. Furthermore, it's implied that the reason she tends to look down on her peers' intelligence and be somewhat of a showoff with her own is because of her own insecurities (which makes for an interesting comparison to her close friend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and later husband</span> Ron Weasley, who's also insecure, but due to not being good (or rather, exceptionally good) at anything.
</li><li> Dumbledore is also qualified for this trope. He is one of the smartest and most powerful wizards in the setting, and he knows it. However, Dumbledore is a reformed version of this trope. He used to be arrogant and controlling, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">an unfortunate accident</a> led him to realize what he was becoming. At that point, he decided to settle down and become a teacher, because he felt he could not be trusted with any real power. During the story, of course, we do get to see him affording himself more power to bring down Voldemort, but no more than necessary.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Dumbledore</strong>: Being, forgive me, rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.
</div></li><li> Voldemort is a half-example—he's a <em>magical</em> genius, yes, but he tends to generalize this and assume it means he's smarter than everyone at every<em>thing</em>. Given that he is in actuality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">not even remotely competent at long-term planning</a>, he manages to get all the downsides of this trope with scant few of the benefits. His main flaw as a strategist is that he'll get so carried away with a clever plan that he forgets his opponents are also clever, and so follows predictable patterns. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The most glaring example, as pointed out by Dumbledore, is that he decided to make every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a> he built out of significant magical artifacts that can be traced to him which he guarded in varying ways (held by his chief lieutenant, bank vault, abandoned home of his mother's side of family, in a seaside cave he visited as a child). If he'd gone the simple route and used a random rock he then threw in a lake there would have been no way to stop him. As Harry, and therefore, the readers, learn more about Voldemort, it becomes increasingly obvious that the main reason his reign of terror lasted so long wasnt due to any real cunning on his end so much as the cunning of his followers and people being too scared of his immense magical power to really try stopping him</span>.

</li><li> Foxface in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> manages to survive without killing a single soul, simply stealing food and hiding. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It bites her in the ass when she steals some berries Peeta had picked without either of them realizing that they were poisonous.</span>

She has a history of using her magic to punish rotten people like Kyle, but it bites her in the ass when it attracts too much attention and gets her in trouble with other witches. While her grand plan to improve Kyle via the curse she puts on him <em>does</em> work perfectly (it's designed so that improving himself is the only effective way he could break the curse by himself), it's also what convinces the other witches to banish her from ever going home. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leastwise, until Kyle accidentally puts a loophole into the spell that lets her go home after he breaks the curse.</span> In the book <em>Bewitched</em>, Kendra apparently had a knack for this even before she had a lot of experience as a witch.

When Fear Sengar points out that former slave Udinaas, by the measure of his intelligence and vision, should have been a king and not a slave, Udinaas acidly counters that he's too smart and driven and would be unable to stop once he'd started to openly question the system. Too many people like him on the loose and any governmental system would eventually collapse in bloody rebellion.

That being said, they aren't as smart as they think, especially Owl who acts like he can read and write, when in reality, he can only spell his own name (which he does incorrectly).
<ul><li> Lampshaded heavily in the philosophical book, "The Tao of Pooh." The author how Rabbit, Owl and <em>Eeyore</em> fall under this for differing reasons: Rabbit being a busybody who always tries to take command and sees himself as the authority figure and Owl in acting like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor">Absent-Minded Professor</a>. Eeyore is this to a lesser extent, albeit in the "cynicism = intelligence" sort of way and the implications of self-sabotage.

However, that just means he gets into trouble that no-one  <em>including him</em>  has any idea how to get out of. He's been doing it his whole life, too; when he was fourteen, his mother caught him making nitroglycerine in the bathtub. Ouch.
<div class="indent">It isn't that hard to make nitroglycerin. The hard part is getting rid of it quietly.

He recounts a past case where he made a mistake. All the facts were present, but he misinterpreted things. He assumed it was this typical path and it nearly cost a loving mother her life and would have left three children orphans. While no one died, one child is still left with extreme mental scars from the event and the mother suffered from a year's worth of nightmares. After explaining what each of the four "A"s are in Wizardry, he notes the fifth "A" is for arrogance.
<div class="indent">"Arrogance," [Harry] said quietly, and wrote it on the board beneath the rest. "That's the fifth A. We carry it around with us. It's natural. We know a lot more than most people. We can do a lot more than most people. There's a natural and understandable pride in that. But when we let that pride get in the way and take the place of truly what is around us, there can be horrible consequences. Watch out for the fifth A, children. The Yardlys turned out all right mostly out of pure luck. They deserve better from me. And from you."
</div></li><li> Lampshaded in "The Singing Bell" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>. Dr. Wendell Urth, upon hearing that Peyton had killed his accomplice on the Moon, with a blaster (the flash of which was spotted by a patrol), and then blew up their ship, points out that, if he were in the murderer's place, he would have murdered his accomplice aboard the ship and blown it up with the body. Inspector Davenport states that Peyton loves challenging the police. However, since this was the first murder on the Moon ever, Peyton failed to take a few things into account this time...

Jake then posits to the dentist that he killed his partner with it in the heat of the moment during an argument and somehow miraculously got lucky at every point where he should have been found out. The doctor snaps that it wasn't luck at all, he planned the entire thing out perfectly, alibi and all, and even tells them what the <em>real</em> murder weapon was (a dental rod he then melted back down). He realizes too late he just confessed. Jake confides to Holt that he knew someone so sure of his intelligence would lose it if they thought he was just a random "dummy" who lucked into this and the idea of his perfect crime being written off as blind luck would goad him into confessing. </span>

</li><li> This happens constantly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em>. So many of the killers come up with really great plans that would have allowed them to literally get away with murder. However, too many of them try to add in a flourish or touch which ends up containing the clues Columbo needs to figure out the truth.
<ul><li> More than once, a killer goes to massive lengths for the "perfect" alibi only to have that be the very thing that trips them up. How often has Columbo done the math to realize how far you'd have to go out of your way to ensure you're seen at a specific time and place?
</li><li> Often, the killer will steer Columbo to a suspect they've managed to expertly frame. But in almost every case, Columbo sees through it simply because there's no way someone could be smart enough to commit such a complex murder but then be dumb enough to leave so many obvious clues behind.
</li><li> A Senator tries to make himself look the victim of the same "killer" of a man he murdered. He puts a bullet from that gun into a wall and fakes it being fired at him during a party. With several people present, the man openly says that if Columbo finds the bullet, he can figure out it's from the same gun. Columbo agrees...and says he's already run the tests as he found that bullet in the wall three hours ago. The man's face falls as he realizes he just implicated himself in front of witnesses.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cersei Lannister is indeed well-versed in the games of subterfuge and underhanded politics amongst the Westeros' nobles, but she fancies herself to be better than she actually is, causing her to often severely underestimate her opponents. Ironically, this also works in her favor, since her opponents often assume she's too rational to do something stupid, only to be blindsided when she does it anyway.
</li><li> Gifted, influential, casually manipulative, and smart-mouthed, Jaime Lannister loves to contemptuously upstage chivalric foes but eventually goes too far and overplays his hand. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then he loses it.</span>
</li><li> Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish is a master <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>, with a firm understanding of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a> and a true knack for turning people against each other. However, being a man who always relies on others to do the dirty work, he occasionally comes to find that he has much less "real" power than he'd like. When he antagonizes Cersei Lannister, she and her guards demonstrate quite clearly that, being the queen, she could have his throat cut on a whim. Much later, in the seventh season, he's so engrossed in his scheme to turn Sansa and Arya Stark against each other that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he fails to realize that Sansa, his protege, has seen through his plans and is lulling him into a sense of false security. He also fails to realize he has almost no allies in the North and even those of the Vale see Sansa, not him, as their true leader. This time, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty">Karma Houdini Warranty</a> expires for good, and Arya executes him.</span>
</li><li> How Olenna regards Renly after his death, a man who counted far too much on his likability and statesmanship in a time of all out war for the Iron Throne, and who possessed the flimsiest claim of all the contestants. Joffrey has the support of his mother's family and actually sits on the throne, Stannis is Robert's next-oldest brother and therefore can contest his "nephew's" succession. Robb Stark and Balon Greyjoy for vastly different reasons claim secession, citing long-time abuses at the hands of the crown, and merely want their own portion. The idealistic Renly wants to be king because he believes his compassion for the smallfolk would make Westeros a more prosperous and harmonious realm. However it's worth noting that he is one of the very few players who were <em>not</em> defeated because of their own mistakes, as nobody in his position would really count being murdered by black magic among possibilities. However many fans have felt Renly's actions would be disastrous in the long term, as it would lead to factional fratercidal wars among the nobility, asking what happens if Renly has a son people don't like, or an ambitious younger son.

Despite everyone in the Stargate program being top in their fields, he's the only one to make such a huge deal out of his intelligence. And on number three... while he regularly makes astounding accomplishments while under threat of imminent death, his biggest failure? Blew up a solar system (well, five-sixths of a solar system), and almost destroyed two universes. His pride is so great that he often refuses to work with other scientists on the team because he's convinced they'd just slow him down. This gets pointed out magnificently in an episode where he's working with Real Life celebrity scientists Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, or rather, refusing to work with them. This gets taken to a literal level when an Ascension machine rewrites his genome. He creates a new form of math just to keep up with his new discoveries. After being forced to choose between ascending or dying, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">invents a cure for himself</a>, returning himself back to "normal" genius levels, not realizing he was in spitting distance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascending</a>. For a kicker, all his notes and his new mathematics are so complex that even <em>he</em> can't figure out what they meant, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">virtually everything that happened completely moot</a>.

</li><li> Samantha Carter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> isn't arrogant, but she knows how smart she is, is constantly being expected to do more and more impressive things to save humanity's collective asses, usually succeeds at saving the day but occasionally has some pretty spectacular screw ups, and gets discriminated against for being female and human by Ba'al and the free Jaffa.
<ul><li> Anubis developed technology that is far more advanced than anyone else at the time, including a device that allows him to directly download information from the brains of captured enemies. When he uses this device, the victim is able to interface with the computer and access plot-critical systems in his spaceship.

At the very least, he loves to put other scientists down. At the same time, he sees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Eli</a> as a protégé of sorts and isn't as hard on him as on others. In fact, on at least one occasion, he told another crewmember that Eli is actually smarter than him.
</li><li> This seems to be a recurring theme for advanced alien races throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a></em>. Once they reach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">a point in their technological development</a> where they could be mistaken for gods, on some level they start to actually believe it, and as a consequence they develop blind spots in their thought processes you could steer a Goa'uld Mothership through:
<ul><li> The Asgard have become so dependent on their technology that they are literally incapable of thinking outside the box. They were very nearly destroyed by the Replicators because they kept throwing more-advanced weapons technology at an enemy that eats technology; they simply couldn't conceive of any other way to deal with the problem. It took the assistance of humans - less advanced technologically, but with more flexible thought processes - to help them gain an advantage. To their credit, they realized and repeatedly come to humans for help.
</li><li> The Ancients are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a> to such a degree that they never consider the long-term consequences of their actions. They tend to create massive, ambitious scientific projects which fail just as often as they succeed. And because these projects are so huge and ambitious, dealing with things like genetic engineering, time travel, and quantum mechanics, the consequences of those failures are <em>catastrophic</em>. If they're lucky, their inventions merely explode spectacularly. If they're not so lucky, they can <em>rip a hole in the universe.</em> Sometimes, projects that initially seem to be successful develop long-term side-effects that are even worse than the problems they were designed to solve. The Wraith, a hostile mutant race inadvertently created in a world-seeding project, are only the most glaring example.

Extremely good Bajoran terrorist with many impossible victories against the Cardassians, but his failures cost him his right eye and the ability to speak without a voice synthesizer. Over the course of the episode, Picard and Ro find that Orta did not make a strike they were investigating, because he didn't have the resources to do so (his freighter could only move at half impulse, for example)...because his rep was such that others were terrified in dealing with him.

</li><li> DS9 also gives us the "Jack Pack", four genetically-enhanced misfits who are allowed to analyze top-secret Starfleet data regarding the Dominion War — and determine that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> should bloodlessly surrender to the Dominion, predicting that within a few generations, an Earth-based rebellion will overthrow the Dominion and create a new Federation. What they don't consider is that the Dominion strategists might run their own analyses and predict such an occurrence. (Weyoun had, in fact, figured on a rebellion starting on Earth and made plans to sterilize the planet as a pre-emptive measure.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> gives us Magnus and Erin Hansen, two exobiologists who go off to study the Borg.

When the Leverage team arrives and starts fielding their own candidate in the upcoming election, Moreau lets them do what they want, both because the U.N. is keeping an eye on the election and because he knows that no matter what the actual results are, he can just have the media report rigged results and then have everyone killed off later. The fact that the new candidate proves to be popular thanks to the team's efforts doesn't worry him since it adds "legitimacy" to his rigged results.

After bringing up how she took anatomy in college, the lawyer dryly states how amazing it is that her "enraged" husband managed to stab her in <em>exactly</em> the right places that would be non-fatal. He then brings up how the knife only has her husband's prints despite her testimony on how she grabbed it during the struggle.

Nacho is an experienced and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart">Street Smart</a> criminal, and a lot of what makes him this is that he's very good at weighing sunk cost and figuring out the most reasonable course of action. Unfortunately, this means his gambits tend to fail because he tends to deal with people who <em>aren't</em> reasonable. For instance, he tries to hire Mike to kill Tuco Salamanca, because he recognizes that Tuco is a violent nutcase and a liability, and he figures that if Tuco dies, the sensible thing to do would be to write it off as an unfortunate case of what happens when a reckless guy takes a job with a high mortality rate. Unfortunately, the Salamanca family is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">not</a></em> sensible, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">their answer</a> to the death of Tuco would look a lot more like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">ceaselessly and unswervingly hunt down whoever did the deed</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThemAll">and then kill them and everyone they ever loved (and anybody who becomes an obstacle, potential witness, or no-longer-needed step) as slowly and painfully as possible</a>."
</li><li> An earlier case of this for Nacho was when he decided to rob a low-level drug thief he was preparing to cut ties with. Nacho thinks about it very logically: the thief isn't good enough to threaten him or rob him back, which leaves going to the cops.

<ul><li> Pete Carroll, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">NFL coach</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">Seattle Seahawks</a>. Since he'd taken over as coach, he built himself a reputation of being a clever coach known to call unexpected plays that resulted in epic wins. This popular coaching style made him popular within the NFL and among football fans. His credibility was cemented when he led the Seahawks to their first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> win in franchise history in the 2013-2014 season against the Denver Broncos and their record-breaking offense. He was able to lead his team back to the Super Bowl for the 2014-2015 season. Until the final twenty seconds of the fourth quarter, Pete Carroll called an excellent game, and even though their opponent, the New England Patriots, took the lead by 4 points, the Seahawks were able to drive down to the Patriots one yard line. Instead of making the logical choice of giving the ball to Marshawn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">"Beast Mode"</a> Lynch, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">one of the NFL's top running backs</a>, who, during the game, ran over 100 yards and got a touchdown, he calls for his quarterback, Russell Wilson, to throw the ball into the end zone. The ball gets intercepted and the Patriots win their fourth Super Bowl during the Bill Belicheck and Tom Brady era, and thus instead of being the coach that won back-to-back Super Bowls for his team (and that would've been pulled off against a coach who has done this before), Pete Carroll is now seen as the coach who made the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">dumbest call in NFL history</a>.
</li><li> The Seahawks had three downs available once they got the ball to the one yard line, but arguably not enough time to call three running plays (incomplete passes take less time off the clock than runs stopped in the field of play) and so, it is argued, it was necessary for Seattle to call a pass rather than a run. The Seahawks could have stopped the clock with a minute remaining by using their final timeout; instead, they let the clock run, apparently believing they could force the Patriots to burn one of their own timeouts, to keep time on the clock for a potential comeback after a Seattle score. Instead Belichick let the clock run, seeing that if he did not call timeout the Seahawks would fail to call one themselves, would fail to substitute in a power running package, and might instead call be induced to call a passing play. The play that Carroll settled on called for one Seahawks receiver to rub off his teammate's defender, leaving his teammate open, but the Patriot defenders were able to anticipate the trick the Seahawks would pull from pregame prep and set themselves up for an improbable interception. A dumb strategy of immediately calling timeout, subbing in a power running package, and then just running the ball up the middle repeatedly until time expired (or until scoring a touchdown) would likely have won the day.

<ul><li> Humans, as a species, are prone to this. Humans are amazingly capable of adapting the environment, including their own behavioral programming, to suit them, which sometimes means overwriting a basic survival instinct. Food? Sex? Sleep? Avoiding violence or dangerous situations? Basic desire to continue existing? People almost routinely violate these basic needs, sometimes to achieve better results at a later date, sometimes out of a sense of moral duty or obligation, sometimes for fun, sometimes to the point of self-destruction.
</li><li> This trope is the reason why a startlingly huge proportion of people who get roped into scams, cults, and buy into other patently bogus things are actually very intelligent. They think of themselves as being too smart to possibly ever be tricked into handing over their money to a crook, or be manipulated by someone who heads a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScamReligion">Scam Religion</a>, or even come to very invalid conclusions, because they believe they're simply so smart that nobody could fool them, so therefore anything which registers in their mind as checking out has to be correct, even if there's good evidence that they're wrong. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle">More than a few cons are based on letting the victim think they've spotted the con and can find a loophole to profit from it, when that supposed loophole is itself actually the bait for the real con.</a> This is also the reason why scammers and the like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">can end up on the other end of this themselves</a>, because they assume that since they're so good at fooling others and know the tricks of the trade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence">they would never fall into the trap themselves</a>.
</li><li> Galileo appears to have been one of these (see his entry under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstructionalDialogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstructionalDialogue">Instructional Dialogue</a>), assuming Simplicio really was a caricature of the Pope. Even before he earned the attention of the Inquisition, he alienated the University of Pisa (which prompted his relocation from Venice to Florence — he needed new patronage) and pushed matters so hard that even the powerful Medici family began to find him a liability. The man just didn't know when to keep his mouth shut.
</li><li> You might find this in education, when the instructor uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socratic</a> Method — feigning ignorance of the subject and asking questions of the students to draw out the correct answer. The intelligent or well-read students will often try to bring out information which, while interesting, either doesn't get to the heart of the matter or assumes that the central question has been answered when it hasn't. This typically leads the instructor to shut the student down — or try to, as such students tend to be stubborn. This is particularly common in American law schools, where the Socratic method is standard. Free advice: There's a reason that Socrates' most famous statement is "I know that I know nothing."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">The Nazis</a>. Most of the senior politicians and generals were brilliant (when the IQ test had been performed on the Nuremberg defendants, most were high above average in the 120-138 range, while the most stupid and clearly insane of them, Julius Streicher, still scored a bit above average) and their military industrial complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerrDoktor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerrDoktor">had been staffed with tens of thousands of equally brilliant officers, engineers and bureaucrats</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler">who used the most advanced technology of their time</a>. They managed to convince themselves so surely of their own superiority that they willingly walked into an unwinnable war. Not to mention that the Allied intelligence services were running circles around them, having subverted essentially every German agent while their own agents were placed in very high positions in the German war effort. Much like the scam/con example above, they'd so thoroughly convinced themselves that they couldn't be fooled that they never even bothered to look.
<ul><li> This mainly had to do with their early success and their racist ideology. Their early successes in the war made them extremely cocky which also gave credence to the idea they were the perfect race. After defeating most of Europe they thought the USSR would be easy because it was full of Slavs. Never mind the fact that the USSR had more troops, massive area to cover, the weather being against them, and having no plan for what to do if the invasion stalled. It was Germans vs Slavs so to them it was an easy win. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Suffice to say they were wrong.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Cocky medical residents should be reminded of "July Syndrome," a catch-all term for the sudden spike in iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment or examination) problems in teaching hospitals around the United States. July, because that's when after 4 years of medical school and accolades, all the brand-new residents start their residencies at once.
<ul><li> There's a reason that many high-end private jets are referred to as "Doctor Killers". A lot of these guys buy a plane that they can't handle, assume it will be simple (because they're very smart, and they bought the model with all the bells and whistles), and end up crashing it and killing themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> Obsessive fandoms in general are often guilty of overthinking matters when it comes to various theories and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a>-y explanations (e.g. A 50-page treatise, complete with diagrams and charts, on how both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Luke Skywalker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TRON" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TRON">TRON</a> are, in fact, secretly clones of one another in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> because both are played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill">Mark Hamill</a>), and simultaneously underthinking them by not checking to see if the premise was sound to begin with (i.e. They were confusing Mark Hamill with Bruce Boxleitner <em>the whole time</em>).

</li></ul></li><li> In 1970s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Quebec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Quebec">Quebec</a>, the Parti Quebecois passed Bill 101, a law that restricted the use of English and promoted French as the primary language in Quebec. The Parti Quebecois' intent was to use Bill 101 as part of their efforts to separate Quebec from Canada, but Bill 101 addressed many Franco-Quebecois's concerns about language issues. As a result, support for separatism actually decreased. In the end, Quebec's language laws actually <em>strengthened</em> Canadian unity, something even the original architect of Bill 101 lamented.
</li><li> Lawrence H. Summers  a former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, a top economic adviser in President Obamas first term and one of the youngest people to earn tenure on the Harvard faculty - reminisced about his undergraduate days at M.I.T. in the 1970s, when the debate over the idea of technological unemployment pitted smart people, exemplified by the great economist Robert Solow, and stupid people, exemplified by a bunch of sociologists. It was stupid to think technological progress would reduce employment. If technology increased productivity  allowing companies and their workers to make more stuff in less time  people would have more money to spend on more things that would have to be made, creating jobs for other people. But at some point Mr. Summers experienced an epiphany. It sort of occurred to me, he said. Suppose the stupid people were right. What would it look like? And what it looked like fits pretty well with what the world looks like today. For large categories of workers, wages are inadequate. Many are withdrawing from the labor force altogether. In the 1960s, one in 20 men between 25 and 54 were not working. Today its three in 20. The population is generally healthier than it was in the 1960s; work is almost uniformly less demanding. Still, more workers are on disability. Essentially, he thought companies would use technology in conjunction with their workers to make ridiculous amounts of money, and dismissed the likelihood that they might use technology to replace their workers and make the same money while paying fewer people. (You can see the complete article <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/business/economy/threatened-by-machines-a-once-stupid-concern-gains-respect.html?ref=nyt-es&amp;mcid=nyt-es&amp;subid=article">here)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Upon learning that DK gave the Coconut willingly, K.Rool concludes it's part of a plot and gives it back. When DK shows up demanding the Coconut back, K.Rool realizes there was no plot and he just threw away the Crystal Coconut when it was handed to him on a silver-platter.
