Important character gets murdered? We're gonna find out who the culprit was. The Eiffel Tower disappears? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CarmenSandiego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CarmenSandiego">We're gonna find out where it went and why.</a> Someone blacks out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsleepForDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsleepForDays">wakes up three days later</a> wearing antique samurai armor and a pink cowboy hat? We're gonna find out what led them to that state of affairs. While mysteries might sometimes be left unanswered inadvertently (such as a series being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">abruptly canceled</a>, or the writers simply forgetting the mystery exists), if the people in charge know what they're doing, for every mystery introduced there's going to be an answer introduced somewhere down the line.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Except when there's not. Sometimes writers will create a mystery but never have any intent of actually giving us an answer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob">Bob</a> will wake up one day to find that $10,000,000 has appeared in his bank account, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob">Alice</a> will discover that someone's rearranged all her furniture while she was out. They might brush these matters aside cavalierly, or they might become obsessed with discovering the truth, but eventually they come to realize that, if they're ever going to get an answer, it's not going to be any time soon, and write off their respective mysteries as "one of those things".
</p><p>This might be done for comedic effect, as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>, or just to reflect reality. After all, how many of us have had something weird happen in our lives but never discovered the "why" behind it all? Like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">all tropes</a>, this sort of mystery can be used to tell really good or really horrible stories depending on the writers' skills, though if you're introducing an answerless mystery, it's generally considered good form to let your audience <em>know</em> they're not getting an answer. It's not quite fair to present viewers a mystery, suspects, and clues that clearly have some sort of resolution, if only in the author's head, but never say what it is. Make it clear that you're not going to let people in on an important secret that you or someone on the production staff knows the answer to, and years might go by and people will <em>still</em> be asking you, "Why did X commit Y on Z?"

A special Dutch comic produced for the 80th anniversary of the triplets' creation stated that she was a NASA test pilot who got lost in space, but fan reaction was mixed, and as the Duckverse has multiple continuities, this isn't necessarily the one "true" explanation (especially as the story contradicts well-known canon: Della is shown passing the nephews to Donald while they are babies/infants, except Donald clearly adopted the children as they were at least older than four).

</li><li> Seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a></em>'s adventure <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinLandOfBlackGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinLandOfBlackGold">Tintin: Land of Black Gold</a></em>: Captain Haddock shows up to rescue Tintin even though he was half a world away, and never gets around to explaining how that was possible. He's interrupted right after "It's both very simple and very complicated.", or "Well, you see, it's like this..." in the English translation. <br/><br/>The lack of explanation for Haddock's appearance is actually a meta joke: The original version of <em>Land of Black Gold</em> was initially serialized in a newspaper in 1939 and 1940, but after Germany occupied Belgium in 1940, Hergé thought that the comic would not pass the German censors because of its political nature, so the publication of <em>Land of Black Gold</em> was stopped mid-story. At this point Captain Haddock hadn't yet been introduced in <em>Tintin</em>, so naturally he didn't appear in <em>Land of Black Gold</em> either. Several other Tintin stories were published before Hergé decided to redraw Land of Black Gold in 1948, and in these intervening stories Haddock had become the most significant character in the series besides Tintin himself. Thus it would've been odd if Haddock had been left out of the new version of <em>Land of Black Gold</em>, but on the other hand he didn't really belong to a story that had been scripted before he even existed. This is the reason why Haddock is virtually absent from the story until the very end, and why there's no explanation for his sudden appearance. The lack of explanation is Hergé's comment on Haddock "invading" a story he wasn't originally a part of. So there <em>is</em> a solution to the mystery <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">on a meta level, but not in the text</a>.

<ul><li> Where did the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSuperior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSuperior">humans</a> originally come from? They're the most numerous species in the galaxy, but one of the few with no identified homeworld, with the explanation being that they've been space-faring for so long (tens of thousands of years) and through so many cataclysms that the information is lost. In-universe, most people generally agree that that humans originally came from Coruscant, but the same sources that say that also go out of their way to point out that this is not confirmed.
</li><li> What role does Earth even play in the Star Wars Universe? Nowhere in the movies is it ever mentioned. The famous opening credits assure us that it takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALongTimeAgoInAGalaxyFarFarAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALongTimeAgoInAGalaxyFarFarAway">A Long Time Ago, in a Galaxy Far Far Away...</a>.

The fact that humans and near-humans can <a class="urllink" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hybrid">produce viable offspring<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, even in cases where they could not in <em>Legends</em> (e.g. human/Twi'lek hybrids), definitely suggests that something is up, given the impossibility of two species on planets thousands of light years apart just happening to evolve so closely.

</li><li> What Jawas look like under their hoods. In the EU, they are described as resembling gaunt rodents of some sort, but other sources suggest they are actually pygmy humans or more closely related to their equally mysterious neighbors, the Tusken Raiders (which leads to the possibility the two are both descended from the extinct Kumumgah).
</li><li> On the subject of Tuskens, what they call themselves has also never been revealed. Both "Tusken Raiders" and "Sand People" are names given to them by their enemies. Even in EU stories with Tusken characters, no species name is given. Possibly they don't actually <em>have</em> such a name for themselves, only identifying as members of a tribe or clan rather than as members of the entire Tusken species.

The characters offer various speculations (space aliens, radioactive mutants from nuclear bomb testings, government-engineered bioweapons), but no firm answer is given. This is because the writers felt that any answer they gave would be cliche and had been used in other monster movies before, and in any case they felt it was unlikely the normal residents of a small town would be able to determine the answer themselves anyway. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors2Aftershocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors2Aftershocks">The first sequel</a> features them finding a fossil that they presume to come from a graboid, meaning that the creatures are presumably a naturally-evolved species that has been around for millions of years and is a Lazarus Taxon.

As they unravel the truth about the political conspiracy they're accidentally at the heart of, they gradually develop both competency and confidence. Hints are dropped throughout the story that Eilifer is lying about his competency level from the beginning, is both extremely powerful and extremely reluctant to use his power, and that he has some kind of connection to the Elf King. When he lets three witches turn him into a horse for hag-riding to protect their usual victim, the witches are horrified to discover the new horse they've created is grey because only the Elf King has grey horses. Ivarr's group - and the witches themselves - are amazed to discover that Eilifer is powerful enough to defeat three powerful witches single-handedly, but he and the witches won't talk about it. At the end of the story, Ivarr acknowledges that Eilifer remains the story's unsolved mystery, to which Eilifer simply smiles.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ivarr:</strong> What do you really believe, Eilifer? <br/><strong>Eilifer:</strong> I believe we'd better hurry back or Finnvard will be prostrated with the fear that we're lost.

</li><li> Was Barty Crouch Jr. really there the night Neville's parents were tortured? He says he wasn't but he was convicted of the crime. Sirius says he's not sure and thinks he could have genuinely been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Dumbledore points out that there isn't a witness. Neville's parents no longer have the facilities to give testimony and he was a toddler who couldn't have possibly understood what happened. While posing as Moody, he shows no remorse for what he might have done when he used the same curse he did on them in front of Neville. By the time of book 4, Voldemort calls him his most loyal servant but given the fact that he'd been in Azkaban and under the Imperius Curse for about fifteen years at that point, he could have been radicalized in prison or gone mad from the curse. Or he could have truly been a fanatic all along given what a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterActor">Master Actor</a> he is and played hysterical at the trial for sympathy from his father. Then again, even if he was a Death Eater before his time in Azkaban, he may not have been present when the Longbottoms got tortured. Hell, even if he was there, that still doesn't clarify his level of involvement. When his ruse is uncovered, there are more important matters at hand and then he's quickly fed to a Dementor, leaving the truth ultimately ambiguous.

</li><li> Throughout the series it's pointed out occasionally that as powerful as magic is, there are a number of things that wizards still haven't figured out how to do, including enchanting humans to fly under their own power (a magical object like a broom or carpet is required), creating food from nothing, and, most prominently, true, complete resurrection of the dead. It's never elaborated on <em>why</em> these things and not others should be so difficult, as well as whether they're literally impossible or if the solution just hasn't been found yet. Notably, in the final book, Voldemort displays the ability to fly under his own power, and uses that ability almost exclusively to travel. It's never revealed how he figured out flight.
</li><li> Related to the above, it's noted that even the most traditional wizard will admit that there isn't a good magical form of long-distance travel. Is there one that no one has figured out yet or is it genuinely something that's outside the scope of what magic can do?

(The unintentional ones are starred.)
<ul><li> What is Tom Bombadil? Tolkien has said, in response to speculation, that he is <em>not</em> Eru Ilúvatar, the god of Middle-earth, which still leaves a lot of other possibilities. According to some letters he sent to friends, <em>Tolkien himself</em> wasn't even sure what Tom was, and in these letters he seems to say that Tom is meant to be a representation of the fact that any Fictional Universe will realistically have characters and elements that are irrelevant to the current plot and which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfCOnservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfCOnservationOfDetail">Law Of C Onservation Of Detail</a> thus forces the writer to leave out.
</li><li> What other evil creatures, which were worse than the Balrog according to Gandalf, were buried under Khazad-dûm?
</li><li> Who were the Ringwraiths before they received the Nine Rings? We know that three (probably including the Witch-king) were Númenóreans, and that Khamûl (the only Ringwraith to be named anywhere by Tolkien) was an Easterling king. Other than that, nothing.
</li><li> Where did Radagast and the blue wizards go?
</li><li> What happened to the Entwives?
</li><li> Was Sam allowed to cross the sea to Valinor? According to his relatives, the answer is yes, but no-one actually knows.
</li><li> Where do the souls of dead Men go when they leave the Halls of Mandos?
</li><li> What was the "First Fall of Man" that Tolkien claims happened before Men arrived in Beleriand? A scrap from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfMiddleEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfMiddleEarth">The History of Middle-earth</a></em> mentions that shortly after awakening, the first Men worshiped Morgoth, but this never made it into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>.

Our heroes first become aware of it when they encounter two tripods practicing for it while on patrol. After Ruki is captured, he refuses to discuss the game, even though he does answer questions about the city and his race which are far more damaging. An initial theory is that the tripods could be mating, however this is proved incorrect when the main characters find out the Tripods are just vehicles for aliens, not aliens themselves.

</li><li> Why did he leave Gallifrey? Various stories for the 25th and 50th anniversaries have presented the circumstances...

<ul><li> It is generally agreed that the vast majority of myths and other sacred stories of religion were exclusively transmitted orally for many centuries before they were first written down. As such, a common "riddle" that religion scholars grapple with is just how accurate the written versions that have survived to the present are to the original spoken versions in the distant past.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTheEarlyYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTheEarlyYears">Where was Jesus and what was he doing between the ages of twelve and thirty-ish?</a> The Gospel writers were not the least bit interested in even hinting at it (save for a glib, hasty note about him "growing in wisdom and spirit", which tells us nothing specific), although a general consensus is that it was left out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail">simply because it wasn't important</a>. According to non-Biblical "gnostic gospels", he <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18948_5-real-deleted-bible-scenes-in-which-jesus-kicks-some-ass.html">stared down a cave full of dragons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, among other things.
</li><li> The pronunciation of the God of Israel's true name, YHWH<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5fsje');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5fsje" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5fsje');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">called the "tetragrammaton" in scholarly circles, meaning literally "four-letter word"</span>, is unknown, as the Hebrew alphabet of the time did not include vowels. The most commonly used pronunciations are Yahweh and Jehovah (the latter of which Hebrew linguists universally agree was <em>not</em> the original pronunciation). Jewish tradition forbids uttering the name of God, and the word <em>Adonai</em> is used instead. In English translations of the Christian Bible, YHWH is mostly replaced with <strong>LORD</strong>, one of several translations for <em>Adonai</em>. 
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels">John's gospel</a>, what does Jesus write on the ground when he stops the stoning of the adulterous woman? The sins of the woman's accusers is a popular theory, although like with Jesus's childhood above, many argue that it would've been elaborated on if it were of actual importance.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfCorinthians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfCorinthians">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>, the Apostle Paul mentions that he was given "a thorn in the flesh". While this is generally agreed by scholars to refer to some sort of ongoing difficulty in his life, the jury is out on what specific thing it actually <em>is</em>. Theories range from physical disabilities like poor eyesight or epilepsy to circumstantial factors like constantly dealing with persecution to spiritual difficulties such as struggling with a particular sin. Whatever it is, he never explicitly describes it.

He's mentioned in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfDaniel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfDaniel">Book of Daniel</a> as a ruler of Babylon between Belshazzar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrusTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrusTheGreat">Cyrus the Great</a> - only problem is, he doesn't appear in any other record of Babylonian rulers. Guesses for his identity range from Cyrus's son-in-law Darius I, projected two generations backward by the author of <em>Daniel</em> (the book was written much later than when it was set) whether accidentally or deliberately, to Cyrus's governor of the city to a completely mythical figure.

</li><li> Odin's two brothers, Vile/Honer and Ve, who helped him create the world and the creatures in it, simply disappear one day. Odin goes to great lengths to find the answer to their disappearance, finally sacrificing his one eye in the Well of Wisdom (as the eye can then see the past, present and future). Yet, he never tells a living soul the answer except his wife. He reasons that "What three know, the whole world knows."
</li><li> When Baldr has been slain Odin rides to the death realm, overcoming many perils for twelve days in order to find him. Finally he meets an old witch. Having spoken with her, Odin abandons his search and goes back to spend his days preparing for Ragnarok. He never reveals to anyone what the witch said.

The narrator, a priestess in a hypnotic trance, sees the world bounce back better than ever after Ragnarok, with the gods returning under a new leader even more powerful and glorious than Odin himself, when suddenly the evil dragon Niddhogg appears and the vision abruptly ends. The new divine leader's identity and Niddhogg's exact role are never elaborated on in this or any other source, and scholars disagree on whether (given the parallels with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jesus">Jesus</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>) this epilogue was a later Christian addition or whether it is authentic to the original story, and clarifying information has been either lost to time or never existed.

This is also an in-universe example, as whatever happened apparently caused a multiverse-wide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> since even the gods themselves (as well as mortal creatures who were born before the gap) don't remember what happened.

<ul><li> What happened to the missing Primarchs?

What was the Pale Wasting?
</li><li> Practically everything about the Alpha Legion. Is Alpharius really dead, and if so, who killed him? Was it Roboute Guilliman? Was it Rogal Dorn? Is Omegon still alive? Did Alpharius even die at all? Maybe "Alpharius" confessed he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a> for the Imperium during the fight and Guilliman agreed to fake his death, or <em>maybe</em> Alpharius actually killed Guilliman and adopted his identity. The clash <em>may not have even happened at all</em>. Also, are they loyal to Chaos, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">to the Imperium</a>, to nobody, or to some mysterious third organisation that also seeks the destruction of Chaos?
</li><li> Are Cypher and the Fallen Angels loyal to Chaos or not?
</li><li> The fates of a few Loyalist Primarchs are still left up in the air. Leman Russ and Jaghatai Khan both disappeared after going on an errand and left no clue of their current status. Vulkan is vaporized in a blast, but it's unknown if that is strong enough to overwhelm his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">perpetuality</a>. Rogal Dorn is said to be dead, but the information regarding his death is conflicting. Some sources state that his whole body is found, some state that his body is torn to shreds, while others state that only his severed hand is recovered. Not helping the matter is the fact that Vulkan believes Rogal is alive many years later, which can either mean that the former has some information pointing towards the latter's survival, or he is simply unaware of his brother's death.
</li><li> Most, if not all, of the mysteries are left deliberately unanswered, as it allows players the maximum scope in interpreting the lore to customize your armies in whatever way the player feels is most interesting to them.

They were also extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist">Naytheists</a> for whom a major part of their outlook was the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">refuting everything as real</a>. During the mid-1st Era, they discovered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Heart of Lorkhan</a> (the "divine center" of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead">dead creator god</a> of the mortal plane) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep">deep beneath Red Mountain</a>. Though there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">many different versions</a> of the story regarding what happened next, the Dwemer did <em>something</em> with the Heart that caused their entire race to disappear from every known plane of existence in a single instant. The leading theory (which you can put together yourself in the Mages Guild quest line in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>) states that they were trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">break themselves down into their base elements</a> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascending into divine form</a>.

Other theories state that they may have even been <em>successful</em> in their attempt, and are currently on said "higher plane". Making it only more confusing is one particular Dwemer ruin that shows that whatever happened was violent and abrupt; it's a residential area, and you find piles of ash that used to be Dwemer in beds or near their piles of equipment on guard duty. Despite the theories, no definitive answer has been given in the series to date.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie">The Movie</a></em>, set after a two-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a> reveals the chest to have been opened in the interim... but neither the movie nor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Steven Universe: Future</a></em> give any hint about what was inside.

<ul><li> The exact nature of Slade himself is never revealed, and given his liberal use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">robot doubles</a>, this includes how many times we've seen the real one. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">comics</a> he is simply Slade Wilson, a mercenary and criminal mastermind also known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a>, but it is never stated if this is true for the animated version as well.

</li><li> The episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TeenTitansS3E2X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TeenTitansS3E2X">X</a>" involves Red X (a supervillain identity Robin had previously invented as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">Reverse Mole</a> plan) showing up, with someone we can be pretty darn sure is <em>not</em> Robin under the signature Red X suit. Fans have wondered for some time who the new Red X really is, and Beast Boy came up with a number of theories, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says Raven came to the only conclusion that mattered:

When asked what's inside it, Robin just says, "It's personal." When the briefcase is finally opened, its lid fills the entire screen, causing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashToBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashToBlack">Smash to Black</a>, the end of the episode, and legions of fanboys/girls demanding to know, "<em>What's in the frikkin' briefcase!!!</em>" Possibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em>, where there's also a briefcase integral to the plot that we never find out the contents of.
