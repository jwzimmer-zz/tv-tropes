When he tries to convince them to talk, he gets hit with this trope. As a result they divorce, his father departs for another plane of existence, and Verityn and his mother are trapped in the cataclysm that destroyed Atlantis.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iznogoud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iznogoud">Iznogoud</a></em>: Several stories see Iznogoud's downfall resulting from his decision to ignore someone (usually the Caliph) who is trying to tell him something important while he tries to carry out his latest scheme to become Caliph instead of the Caliph.
<ul><li> In "The Mysterious Billposter", in attempting to trap the Caliph in a magic poster advertising holidays on a tropical island, Iznogoud has got himself trapped in the poster as well, and he keeps sending the Caliph away on walks so that he can escape unnoticed. As each escape plan fails, the Caliph keeps returning to tell Iznogoud about the strange things he has seen, and the increasingly angry Iznogoud keeps dismissing him. Eventually, the Caliph takes the hint and leaves, surprised that Iznogoud doesn't want to hear that he's found another person in the poster world: the billposter who created the magic poster to begin with, and who is now putting up a second poster of the Caliph's bedroom which he tries out on the Caliph. Sure enough, the Caliph re-appears in his own world, while Iznogoud is reduced to ordering Wa'at Alahf to shove him backwards repeatedly in the hope that he'll fall out of the poster again.
</li><li> In "The Strong-Arm Men", Iznogoud hires two men to take the Caliph away but it takes a long time before they have a chance to do it without any witnesses around. When the time arrives, the Caliph tries to tell Iznogoud something but is completely ignored. It turns out the Caliph borrowed Iznogoud's money for a fundraiser and Iznogoud can't pay the strong-arm men. In retaliation, they take <em>him</em> instead of the Caliph away.
</li><li> In "The Merchant of Forgetfulness", when Iznogoud tries to spray an amnesia scent on the Caliph, he ignores the latter's complaints about the open window. A gust of wind blows the potion on Iznogoud's face, wiping his mind and memory completely.

Nyx, who is also in attendance (it's "Take Your Foal to Work Day") comes up with an idea, but Twilight just shushes her, and finally asks her to just hold onto her question and ask it later. To her credit, when she later gets a note from Nyx with a basic solution to the problem (casting the cloudwalking spell on the clouds), she not only realizes her earlier mistake even before reading it (and does apologize to her daughter), it forms the basis of a permanent solution: converting the unicorn enchantment into a potion - with Zecora's help - that can be sprayed on clouds for temporary work, or added to the cloud mixer so it lasts as long as the cloud does.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> story "The Screaming Woman" revolves around a young girl trying to warn anyone who'll listen about the woman she can hear screaming for help under the ground. She fears foul play, but everyone ignores her or, naturally, makes her take enormous waste-of-time detours and then brushes her off again. She's only believed when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the woman stops screaming and starts singing to herself, a song only she and the girl's father have ever known, which gets him to start digging.</span>

Eddard did actually stop and listen to his daughter, but she was so flustered her explanation came out as complete gibberish about monsters. The fact that the two men used so many code words only made it harder, even she barely understood what it meant.

Not surprising that the minute he turned sixteen, Aegon marched into the throne room and said "okay, you can all get lost now."

<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Poe:</strong> You're so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">paranoid</a> about Count Olaf. Remember at Professor Montgomery's house? You were convinced a visiting scientist was Olaf. <br/><strong>Violet:</strong> But he <em>was</em> Olaf! <br/><strong>Mr. Poe:</strong> That's not the point!
</div><ul><li> Ironically, in this particular instance, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he turns out to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight">right</a></em>.</span>
</li><li> Everyone is like this to the kids. It backfires spectacularly when, during a reunion of everyone in the series, they refuse to believe the building they are in is on fire.
</li><li> This is even lampshaded in the movie, when Count Olaf seemingly has succeeded in his plan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and married Violet</span>, leading him to mock everyone with the knowledge that the children repeatedly tried to warn them but "no one <em>ever</em> listens to children!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Return to Labyrinth</em>: This happens in Tokyopop's manga series, when Moppet tries to tell Mayor Spittledrum that Jareth wants to see him but Spittledrum interrupts her saying that even if the Goblin King himself were here to see him, he was busy right now and the guest will have to wait.
</li><li> Terry Brooks example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfShannaraTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfShannaraTrilogy">The Elfstones of Shannara</a></em>: although Wil Ohmsford doesn't say the trope name, he does ignore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">poor little Wisp</a>, who keeps trying to tell him something—but he's so set on getting the Elfstones back from Mallenroh so he can prove himself Amberle's protector that he doesn't even pay attention to the hysterical shrieking.

</div></li><li> Visser 3 from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> brings this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with his manner of maiming or even executing minions who would interrupt him in the middle of an important matter with some hogwash. Naturally it dishes him:
<ul><li> In "The Secret" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> skunk-morphed Cassie sprays Visser 3 and the Animorphs give him the remedy for the smell in exchange for Yeerks cancelling an operation. Unfortunately for him they tell him it's GRAPE juice, not tomato juice, that gets rid of the smell. This has the added hilarity of turning him a lovely shade of purple.</span> One of the Controllers apparently knows of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actual</span> remedy but Visser 3 won't allow him to speak.
</li><li> At one point some Controllers make a correct guess that the "Andalite bandits" (as Visser recognizes the morphing-able guerillas) are possibly humans. But none of them dare to advise their dreadful leader that he could be wrong.
</li><li> Every now and then, the kids themselves are guilty of this as well. In the book where they time travel, Ax spots the Hessians about to assassinate George Washington, but everyone brushes him off, even though he <em>clearly</em> thinks that there's something wrong.
</li><li> Nicely subverted in one book. The Animorphs are in dolphin morph and are looking at the Yeerk undersea base. Ax comments that a large school of fish are approaching. Rachel blows him off, but Marco recognizes Ax's tone and asks for Ax to clarify. It's a school of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark">hammerhead sharks</a>. And they're being controlled by the Yeerks.
</li></ul></li><li> "Tikki Tikki Tembo" is a book set in ancient China. There are two brothers. The eldest, in accordance with alleged tradition, is given a ridiculously long name; Tikki Tikki Tembo No Sa Rembo Chari Bari Ruchi Pip Peri Pembo. The younger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">Unfavorite</a> was named Ping. When the eldest tried to say that his brother had fallen in the well, his parents immediately listened. But when Ping tried to tell them the same situation with his brother, they rebuked him for mispronouncing the name and wouldn't let him speak until he got it right. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Why he didn't just say "my older brother"...</a>
<ul><li> Could be that they'd made a point of ignoring him/rebuking him if he <em>didn't</em> use the name, previously.

He's talking about trying to find out what the Vord Takers look like so they can find them and keep them away, and it takes several tries for a subordinate to get him to stop brushing him off and listen to the fact that they have one caught under a cup.

</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a></em> books. The quartet's teachers take any strange things the children see or hear seriously and encourage them to report such happenings.

Too bad Liam has a stuttering problem. Dad pushes Liam away again and again as his friends light it, and just as they throw it, Liam screams out his sister's name. A second too late.</span>
</li><li> <em>The Nanny Diaries</em>: Played quite literally (and tragically), where the authors coin the term "spatula reflex" to describe the way Mrs. X is constantly brushing off Greyer every time he wants his mother for something.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em>The Lancelot Closes at Five</em>, when Hutch and the narrator are hiding under the bed of the eponymous model home, and a small boy sees them and yells "Girls under bed!" Hutch says its nothing to worry about, it happens all the time on TV, and no one believes the kid.

</li><li> In <em>More Adventures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatBrain">The Great Brain</a></em>, Tom fakes monster tracks to scare another boy away from Skeleton Cave, but the adults fall for them as well. Tom never really expected this, and tries to tell Papa and Uncle Mark, but Mama won't let him, saying they have more important things to worry about right now.

This is because Dumbledore is afraid that Voldemort is trying to possess Harry, so he's trying to keep his distance from the protagonist. He admits to holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> on this one and apologizes at the end.
<ul><li> Harry gets a <em>government-wide</em> version of this after he tries to warn everyone that Voldemort has come back. Fudge is afraid of the wizarding world being thrown into another war, so he decides that the best course of action is to launch a smear campaign that goes along the lines of "Harry is a confused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a>." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It takes Fudge and the government higher-ups being in the <em>same room as Voldemort</em> for them to realize they have made a terrible, terrible mistake.</span>

Her older brother Percy coincidentally arrives, and since his (hidden) girlfriend was one of the victims, she flees. He brushes it off as something that was about him, but unimportant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shes then taken into the titular Chamber before she can try again</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VoidCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VoidCity">Void City</a></em>, Tabitha tries several times to tell Eric important information about Rachel, but he manages to cut her off each time; as he is her vampire sire, she is incapable of disobeying his orders, and so literally cannot continue speaking about the subject when he tells her to stop talking about it.
</li><li> The second book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series starts with Rachel attempting to warn Chase that some strange creature is approaching while Chase is busy discussing some matters with Zedd. Chase brushes her off, since an indoors garden can have no dangerous animals. Once they barely beat off the murderous demonic creature (at the cost of several dozen bystanders), Chase tells her "Give me a kick if I ever ignore your words again".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WingsOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WingsOfFire">Wings of Fire</a></em>: Sunny, the youngest of the Dragonets Of Destiny, often gets ignored by the others when she tries suggesting an idea of her own.

A child who constantly interrupts is bribed by his parents with a silver dollar if he'll stay silent while a stranger tells his story. The story is that the man was trapped outside in the snow and his life was saved only because someone looked outside the window and spoke up. And of course, the situation's repeating itself outside, and the kid's the only one facing the window... They still gave him the silver dollar in the end, even though he interrupted a few times...

Baltar told it to shut up; he was enjoying watching the destruction of the battlestar. The Cylon finally managed to say, "Sir, I really think you should take a look at the <em>other</em> battlestar," as the <em>Pegasus</em> attacked.

Elegua was made chief messenger and the keeper of the keys to all dimensions and pathways, with the ability to travel unimpeded through time. The little one also gets to eat first in every ceremony.

Boo Boo has the correct solution right from the start, but no-one listens to him until the end after visiting many different places.
</li><li> Cubbi Gummi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGummiBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGummiBears">Adventures of the Gummi Bears</a></em> also suffers from this trope from time to time; most notably in the episode, "The Fence Sitter", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he came up with a good idea to get rid of the bird that was threatening to gobble up the entire Gummiberry crop.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em>. This happened on a regular basis in the 1973/74 season. About every other episode Wendy or Marvin would try to get the attention of one of the superheroes, usually when they were talking to someone else, and the hero would tell them to wait. They would sometimes give Wendy or Marvin a chance to speak once they were done discussing the more important matter, but not always.
<ul><li> "The Baffles Puzzle". When Wendy and Marvin try to tell Robin about Wonder Dog sneezing at the museum, he brushes them off.
</li><li> "The Fantastic Frerps". When Marvin tries to tell the Super Friends about his strange adventure with the disappearing shack, Superman tells him to wait till later as they have an emergency.
</li><li> "The Menace of the White Dwarf". Wendy and Marvin's bicycle disappears while they're at a gas station. When they try to tell Superman about it, he tells them to hold it a minute.
</li><li> "To Hot To Handle". When Wendy tries to tell Superman that she and Martin have discovered a man who is turning up at the site of heat wave disasters, he tells her to wait because Professor von Knowalot is talking.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a></em> has John, Paul and George repeatedly dismissing Ringo (and finally singing the song "Don't Bother Me") while they're on a car trip; he's just trying to tell them about the two thieves attempting to kill them and steal their book of unreleased music. Finally he gives up and just starts foiling the thieves himself.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Pete</a> never listens to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRespectGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRespectGuy">PJ's</a> warnings or points. Sometimes this will result in PJ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">resigning quietly</a> and nothing else happening, but more often than not it ends up leading to disaster. And though he does so less frequently with her, he has also done it with his daughter, Pistol, like one time when there's a <em>dinosaur</em> in the house.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em> storyline "The Treasure of Monte Zoom", after Rocky and Bullwinkle find the treasure, Rocky tries to figure out a way to open the chest. Bullwinkle keeps trying to suggest something, only for Rocky to keep interrupting, though instead of "not now" responses, he keeps listing ways Boris and Natasha had tried and failed to get it open. Rocky eventually asks Bullwinkle what he thinks, to which he says "If you'd stop talking, I'll tell ya!", and Rocky explains that he was just trying to build some suspense.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>, a witness is describing Octus' father disguise to Detective Blutosky. Octus, standing nearby, alters his appearance to make him appear different from the description. A child sees Octus' face morphing and tries to get the attention of his mother. The mother, not having seen him before he morphed, tells him not to stare.
</li><li> Trying to deliver news in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, Kai is brushed off despite just having saved Tenzin and three-quarters of Team Avatar, though he stubbornly keeps trying despite several interruptions and brush-offs. When he's gotten to say his piece Mako chastises him for not saying this earlier, to Kai's irritation.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfSpeedRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfSpeedRacer">The New Adventures of Speed Racer</a></em> whenever Spritle had something important to say the adults would ignore him.
</li><li> An all-kid version: In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PunkyBrewster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PunkyBrewster">Punky Brewster</a></em> episode "Growing Pain," Glomer starts to grow uncontrollably after he sneezes from eating pepperoni pizza. The flowers from Margaux's parade float help Glomer to shrink a little, but as he tries to tell Punky this, she's not listening because she's competing against Margaux with her own float.
<div class="indent"><strong>Glomer:</strong> But Punky... Margaux's flowers making me— <br/><strong>Punky:</strong> I don't want to hear another word about Margaux's dumb flowers! <br/>(<em>Later, when he finally tells Punky this</em>) <br/><strong>Glomer:</strong> Flowers shrinking me back to normal. Pretty nifty, huh? <br/><strong>Punky:</strong> Glomer, why didn't you tell me? <br/><strong>Glomer:</strong> Well, I trying to. But you say "I don't want to hear another word about Margaux's dumb flowers"!
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold">The Greatest Story Never Told</a>", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> who's constantly put on crowd control, learns that a man with a black hole embedded in his chest is about to inhale the entire world.

And after Booster saves the day on his own, all he gets is a lecture from Batman for leaving his post.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> On the night before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">D-Day</a>, the commander of the Panzer reserves that could have reinforced the Normandy defenses was suffering from insomnia and, thus, took a sleeping pill and gave strict orders that he was not to be disturbed for any reason. By the time he woke up, Normandy had been taken.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was asleep when D-Day began and his aides refused to wake him up, giving the Allies valuable time to advance while German troops couldn't move without Hitler's approval.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a>
<ul><li> Gave his guards standing orders never to wake him. When he had a stroke in the night, it took them all day to work up the courage to check on him. He died shortly afterwards. Might also count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">The Dog Bites Back</a> since people were really hoping the crazy bastard would die before he decided to take everyone down with him via surprise poisoning or death warrants.
</li><li> The several months leading up to Barbarossa. Everyone, from the Western Allies, to the Soviet spies within German command, to his own super spy man in Japan, Richard Sorge, was telling him that the German assault would begin, even providing the precise day. The reports were either not believed, were filed away within the massive Soviet bureaucracy doing nothing, or simply were not acted upon. To add insult to injury, when the Germans and their Eastern European allies DID cross the frontier, Stalin was asleep and it took HOURS before anyone woke him out of sheer, crazed fear at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger">how he would react.</a>
<ul><li> That part is highly exaggerated. With Hitler constantly shifting the attack date, and the forces on the border not even matching what was sent against France in 1940, the reports <em>legitimately</em> weren't believable, and some, in fact, <em>were</em> obvious misinformation (a classic being one stating the first priority for Germans would be bombarding car factories in Moscow - Stalin famously wrote on that report "tell your source to go f**k himself"). As for the "hours before they woke him up", much of the inner circle was in his cabinet at quarter to six in the morning.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> Colonel Johann Rall, leader of the Hessian mercenary garrison at Trenton, was playing either chess or cards on Christmas Eve. A loyalist farmer came to him with urgent news, but he refused to be drawn away from his game. The farmer wrote him a note, which was passed to the Colonel - and ended up in his pocket, unread. Shortly thereafter an unexpectedly large force of revolutionaries attacked, butchering the Hessians and fatally wounding Rall. The loyalist had been trying to tell him about a large group of armed people crossing the Delaware River, which as every American schoolchild knows was commanded by George Washington. The engagement proved a morale-boosting victory for the rebels, one which meant that the British didn't have the manpower to support garrisons across New Jersey, which was effectively left to the rebels. Accordingly, they drew their troops back into the are of new York City where the Royal Navy could shore up their supply lines.
</li><li> A 4-year-old boy spent five hours trying to tell his parents that Grandma had fallen over in the backyard and broken her hip.
</li><li> A much less serious, but more common, example that many of us have committed ourselves. Some computer programs cause the same dialogue boxes to appear so often that users can get into the habit of clicking away <em>every</em> box without thinking, even ones with important new information. (Not helped by the frequency of pop-up ads designed to imitate those boxes.) This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">exploited</a> by free <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1hmqc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1hmqc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1hmqc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">as in free beer, not as in free speech</span> software distributor sites, who often co-install other (not asked for) software or browser extensions such as a Search Tool Bar, by relying on the user just clicking "Accept" without reading to just get through the installation process.
</li><li> In a cruel moment in Florida in 2011, an autistic boy tried to warn social workers that his two siblings, a pair of twins, were being abused, but his stepmother, who adopted all three of them, told a DCFS investigator that the boy was "low-functioning"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2z0g6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2z0g6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2z0g6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The "high and low functioning" labels in autism are controversial, but apparently it was taken for granted that a "low functioning" person couldn't tell the truth, or didn't know fantasy from reality</span> and ordered him to watch TV. Four days later, one of the twins was murdered and her body destroyed in acid. This angered a lot of autism rights groups, who called for the stepmother's execution for killing one child, and life imprisonment for silencing another by assuming an ableist attitude.
<ul><li> This was <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Nubia_Barahona">the Barahona case<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, one of the <em>nastiest</em> child abuse and murder cases in recent memory. Not only had the autistic boy tried to report on "the secret", but the stepmother's granddaughter had told her therapist about the extreme abuse the twins were going through. This therapist had then called DCFS and gotten the brush-off.
