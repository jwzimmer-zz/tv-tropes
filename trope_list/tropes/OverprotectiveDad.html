Unfortunately, he tends to take it all too far, holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules">Eight Simple Rules For Dating My Teenaged Daughter</a> as his personal bible.
</p><p>Once he gets over his denial that his baby is all grown up, the Overprotective Dad becomes convinced that her smiling at a boy, let alone kissing or dating, is half a step away from her having sex and getting pregnant. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APartyAlsoKnownAsAnOrgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APartyAlsoKnownAsAnOrgy">Parties</a> are always an orgy if she is going.

Unfortunately for the poor young man who eventually attracts her interest, the Overprotective Dad isn't going to be inclined to give him an inch—he will receive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSympathy">No Sympathy</a> for any chaos that results from their courtship, and even the slightest or most obvious misunderstanding or misconception about the man will have the Overprotective Dad warning him to "stay away from her!"

Oddly, we never seem to hear from the boys' parents, who, one assumes, might object to their sons being threatened with violence.
</p><p>This trope is especially common in stereotypes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a>, where every sweet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle">Georgia Peach</a> has a very large (usually fat, hairy, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholicParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholicParent">drunk</a>) father in a white tank top that usually keeps a rifle or shotgun with him at all times.

</p><p>Depending on how this is played and how much you want to dissect it, this trope can carry all of the same problems as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut">My Girl Is Not a Slut</a> and may imply that the woman in question is less an agent of her own destiny than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre">her male relatives</a> or, worse yet, that she's somehow their property. The concept can also easily become even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squickier</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad">Pervert Dad</a>. Ironically, if the father has a son, he may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">applaud or encourage him</a> if he treats girls in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">exact way he doesn't want other guys to treat his own daughter.</a>
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flips</a> are less common, i.e. fathers more concerned about the girls/women their sons date. This is due to several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">double standards</a>, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTough">Men Are Tough</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">All Men Are Perverts</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager">A Man Is Always Eager</a>. Cougars are usually jokes instead of threats; men are subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedoHunt">pedo hunts</a>. Overprotective <em>moms</em> are also very rare, typically not being all that concerned with who their kid of either sex dates. At worst they'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a>, who's more likely to nag and nitpick the significant other, usually a woman, to death for not being good enough for her son/kid which isn't the same as threatening to kill somebody for talking to your daughter. They're also just as, if not more likely, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">wait until</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">after</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObnoxiousInLaws">the wedding</a> before they start antagonizing their child's significant other.
</p><p>This character may or may not think he's being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolf</a>, but this a different trope. If it belongs in the latter then don't put it here. The same person can be both at different times but those times are <em>different</em>. However, this trope might overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarParent">Knight Templar Parent</a> if the dad goes to dangerous extremes in their overprotectiveness.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiKora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiKora">Ai Kora</a></em>, Sakurako's dad is pretty overprotective (he even gets into an "overprotectiveness battle" with Maeda in chapter 35), but this is a bit more understandable, given that he knows his daughter has been burned by bad relationships before.
</li><li> Miho Azuki's father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">never actually appears</a>, but has shades of this. He moves his family to Hachioji so that Miho, who goes to high school and auditions there, will not have to leave too early or face potential sexual harassment on the train and the action strikes Takagi as fairly drastic ("How over-protective is he?"). It remains to be seen whether he knows or approves of her relationship with Mashiro.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Ichigo's father Isshin is always having fits about protecting his two young daughters (Karin and Yuzu) from any and all dangers. Later subverted in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that he's always known about supernatural dangers much of the world is unaware about. That and he's a Soul Reaper</span>. Also subverted in that while he's obsessed with ensuring the safety of his daughters, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is and has always planned on using his son as a living weapon, even admitting that a father who claims he's willing to let his own son die is a better father to his son than him. He himself isn't very happy about it.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>, Yuu's father averts this. After Touko learns that Yuu's older sister Rei has a boyfriend, she asks if her father disapproves of the boyfriend, but Yuu laughs and says no. As she puts it, Rei having a boyfriend means that her father is no longer the only man in the family. Later on, Rei, thinking about how her family might react to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre">Yuu going out with Touko, another girl</a>, concludes that her and Yuu's father "acts gruff, but he's really a big softie," so Rei's less worried about him than about her mother.
</li><li> Akane Hino's father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodEXaXXion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodEXaXXion">Cannon God E Xa X Xion</a></em> turns into this temporarily (after spending all his other appearances as a mostly useless wimp) after he finds out that male lead Hoichi Kano had sex with his daughter. Kano got punched a lot. Which is kinda fair considering that Hoichi is currently fighting the alien occupation on earth, meaning that his daughter would be in danger by being in a relationship with him. Heck, she was interrogated and used as a secret weapon against him, her sister was nearly killed by Hoichi's giant mecha, and now her entire family must remain in hiding to be safe, all because of her just being <em>friends</em> with him. Probably the most rightfully protective dad on this page.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em> has a couple examples:
<ul><li> The first is a rich man who kept his daughter away from people for her entire childhood, and when she got a job in a fast-food place, he went and hired City Hunter, <em>knowing fully well he was not just a bodyguard but a killer too</em>, to protect her from perverts. He had a point: first, he hired the killer only after seeing an obvious pervert flirting with his immensely naive daughter (you can imagine his horror when he finally met City Hunter and saw that <em>he</em> was the pervert); second, that fast food was in the middle of a territory subjected to a turf war between two rival yakuza groups, turf war that had already claimed <em>four</em> directors of that fast food and would claim a fifth after the end of the arc. Admittedly, he didn't know of the turf war when he hired City Hunter, but he was right.
</li><li> The other is a politician whose reaction to his daughter running away from home is to hire Umibozu (a known killer) to take her back home and <em>murder her boyfriend</em>. Given his daughter's reaction to Umibozu attacking with a bazooka, it wasn't the first time he did something like that. Again, he had a point by accident: she had run from home not only to go away with her boyfriend but also because she was being pursued by a terrorist organization for accidentally witnessing where they had placed a <em>nuke</em>. Also, he gave his blessing when he saw that the boyfriend reacted to the terrorists attacking her by shielding her with his body.
</li></ul></li><li> Akio Furukawa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a></em>. Most extreme example in <em>After Story</em>, where he became rather enraged at the prospect of Tomoya having sex with Nagisa despite them <em>being married already</em>.

In the sequel, he actually comes to Harry's defense when an evil sorcerer is torturing him, making it clear that the guy in question is going to suffer and die for the crime of 'attempting to harm his daughter's beloved.' Overall, Harry describes his prospective father-in-law as being "friendly. Terrifying, but friendly."
<ul><li> It should be noted that Wanda can more than look after herself, and is one of the few people below <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity">Cosmic Entity</a> level who might actually be more powerful than he is.

</li><li> The father in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVtCDFq5T2w">this German film adaptation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the fairy tale "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JorindeAndJoringel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JorindeAndJoringel">Jorinde and Joringel</a>" does not approve of his daughter's relationship with Joringel and uses violence against him a number of times. (This character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a> and does not appear in the original story.)
</li><li> In Disney's <em>My Date with the President's Daughter</em>, when Duncan is about to take the title girl out (he had no idea who she was when he asked her out), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurPresidentsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurPresidentsAreDifferent">her father</a> comes in and tells him to have her back by 10 PM. He even threatens to institute the draft if anything happens to his daughter (of course, if Duncan knew anything about how US government works, he'd know the President doesn't have that power). He also sends two Secret Service agents with them. At the end of the film, he seems to have mellowed a little and even shows up at Duncan's school to tell him he's ok with them dating and has accepted that his daughter is just a regular teenager. Then, when Duncan takes Hallie out again, the camera pulls back to reveal their car flanked by four Secret Service vehicles with a helicopter providing aerial support.

</li><li> In <em>Herbie: Fully Loaded</em>, Ray Peyton Sr. is dead set against his daughter Maggie being a racer, as much as she wants to follow in his footsteps. This is for two understandable reasons; one, because she had gotten into a bad car accident while street racing years ago, and two:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ray Peyton Sr.:</strong> Because you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">the spitting image of your</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">mother</a>.

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyFirstDates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyFirstDates">50 First Dates</a></em>, when Henry tries to get close to Lucy, her father and brother naturally assume he just wants to have consequence-free sex with her, possibly even multiple times, given her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a>. This is justified, given Henry's reputation as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a>, and the fact that it's extremely difficult to have a relationship with a woman, who forgets all about it the following morning. However, this is subverted later, when Lucy's father actually starts to try to get them together.
</li><li> Mitchell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blockers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blockers">Blockers</a></em> is completely in denial about how grown up his daughter Kayla is, and immediately distrustful of her prom date Connor, to the point where when he thinks they've had sex he throws Connor through a wall.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chanthaly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chanthaly">Chanthaly</a></em>: Chanthaly's father won't even let her leave the house due to her heart-based disease.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paddington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paddington">Paddington</a></em> films, Mr. Brown is a variation of this trope — he's not overprotective in a romantic sense (he appears to have no objection that we see to his daughter dating or the boys she dates), but in a "must protect my kids from every physical threat possible, even if it only exists in my head" sense. And interestingly, his overprotectiveness mainly kicks in around his son rather than his daughter, because he's reckless and she's sensible.
</li><li> Adrian Toomes, played by Michael Keaton, is one of these in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpidermanHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpidermanHomecoming">Spiderman Homecoming</a></em>, although he isn't so overprotective that he denies Liz any freedom. He clearly loves Liz deeply, and the main reason he went into villainy was to be able to continue to provide for her and his wife. Liz isn't surprised at all when Adrian jokingly says he has to give Peter "the Dad Talk" when dropping them off at the Homecoming dance (it's really to confront Peter, whom he figured out is Spider-Man during the drive). He'll kill you if you threaten Liz or try to prevent him from providing for her, but if you save her life he will <em>not</em> forget it.
</li><li> In the French silent film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaRoue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaRoue">La Roue</a></em>, Sisif doesn't like other men looking at Norma nor does he like her dressing in a way that's likely to get their attention. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PervertDad">He has his reasons.</a>

Charlie was raised by his grandmother and is protective of her. The main reason he is so vocal about his disapproval of searching for Lorenzo is because he doesn't want his grandmother hurt by a man who may or may not be alive.

Sergeant Bothari is crazily overprotective of his daughter Elena and gets violent when a guy tries to start a relationship with her. It's typical of this trope for the dad to be overprotective because he knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">All Men Are Perverts</a>. Well, in Bothari's case, he is a former rapist and she herself is the product of him raping a prisoner-of-war. After Elena finds this out, she is utterly disgusted by him.

He beats her up whenever she does something odd (commenting that he worries about her A LOT) and when he finds out that she's been spending time with the rest of the Loser's Club, he demands that she take off her pants so he can check her barrier. Thankfully she gets away, but wow.

At first, this is partly from self-preservation, as he believes Marius (who has been exchanging glances with Cosette) is an agent of the police, but once he finds out that they have been secretly meeting he wishes Marius dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then inverted as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">designates him as his successor in taking care of Cosette</a> and saves him from the Barricade.</span>

Quite reasonable, right? She has a number of such amulets from both Anton and her mother, as well as the heads of both Moscow Watches. However, Anton has also added a low-level spell to the earring to ward off any boys until her 18th birthday. His daughter suspects this and is extremely annoyed. Anton swears to her that this isn't true and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">tells the readers not to judge him, especially if they happen to be fathers with teenage daughters of their own</a>. The spell doesn't appear to be working to ward off Innokenti, who becomes her boyfriend, but this might be because the boy is a potentially Higher Other. Innokenti does, however, want to wait a little longer before they have sex, earning him some respect from Anton, even though it annoys his daughter, who wants to consummate the relationship.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carmilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carmilla">Carmilla</a></em>: Although Laura never blames her father, there are clear hints that he is afraid of letting go of her. Even though Laura is suffering from loneliness at the castle, her father does not take her to balls, send her to a boarding school, or consciously prepare her for a life outside of the castle. When he tells Laura of the death of Bertha Rheinfeldt, General Spielsdorf's niece whom she was looking forward to meeting, he adds that he is "very glad" that Laura never got to know Bertha, because this way she has been spared the grief of losing a friend. Taken to its conclusion, this reaction indicates that he prefers his daughter not to have friends at all rather than to risk grief from experiencing loss; obviously not a very wise precept.

</li><li> Played straight when Al goes so far as to hurt each and every one of Kelly's boyfriends (and boy, does she have a fair amount). He does that to protect the family's reputation (Kelly's very low standards means that most of the guys she dates <em>truly</em> are scum, and this is one of the very few times when Al actually shows some responsibility as a parent), while he doesn't mind when Bud gets some (but once in a while)...

At the end of one episode, he <em>handcuffed</em> her to keep her from <em>talking</em> to a boy, and it was played for <em>laughs</em>. However, considering how she's implied to have acted before coming to him, it was a fairly understandable level of caution. He gets much better about that whole thing later on as she gets a bit older and more mature. At one point, we think the APB he's been given is about the Mystery of the Week as he rushes off... to confront his fifteen-year-old daughter who is wanted on charges of credit card fraud to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. All through the first season, it was played with, as his being protecting her from the law (he <em>is</em> in the business of "law enforcement" after all). After that, he started to relax as she became more comfortable and began to fit into the town. To the point that he has not voiced any problems with Zoey and her boyfriend going to colleges in the same city <em>on the other side of the country</em> from Eureka. When he walks in on them being... intimate, his only reaction is "now my day is complete" and then turns to work on the issue of the week. At the end of the episode, it is commented on his self-restraint not making any threats while they are making out in public.

If you're still grounding your daughter and preventing her from seeing her boyfriend when she's old enough to rent an apartment (or at least a car), then it's probably safe to say that it's moved outside being a "tough but fair" approach to parenting and into the realm of control freakish-ness (although to be fair, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">the girlfriend didn't seem to be trying to stop it</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeetTheParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeetTheParents">Jack Byrnes</a> didn't tell us he had family there.

Roughing the tailor up in the middle of Quark's for holding Ziyal's hand before embarking on a dangerous mission comes to mind. However, this has as much to do with the identity of the man in question as with a general protectiveness of his daughter; it's well-established by this point that Dukat and Garak hate each other, possibly because Garak might have had something to do with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dukat's father's death</span>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Future is Wild</em> animated series: C.G.'s father comes off strict and demanding of his Daughter, Cassiopeia AKA C.G., but this is due to being overprotective. He is always overly considered for her safety and wellbeing and at first, keeps C.G. from learning on her own in his desire to make sure she succeeds in her mission and returns home safely. Not helping with his overprotectiveness is the fact that he doesn't at first approve of C.G. bringing her crew of 21st-century teenagers (Ethan, Emily, and Luis), often calling them primitives. Thankfully, over the course of the series, he changes his attitude for the better once he realized that C.G. needs friends her age and stepped back to give her more flexibility to lead the mission.

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> dealt with an extremely overprotective dad who treated all of his children this way, including his twin boys, who were Bobby's age. He treated them (and the rest of the boy scouts) like babies just because one had ADHD and the other was hyperglycemic. To the point he kicked Bobby out of the scouts simply because he was playing a fighting game, considering him a bad influence.

He's so overprotective that no-one has ever dated his daughter because every boy who ever tried got scared away during the "pre-date"... interrogation. Willy, the main character, fares no better in trying to woo Angela. Even when Angela decided to defy her father's decision, his response was to <em>move the entire family out of town</em> just to make sure he kept his daughter "protected". Appropriately enough, his wife is also an equally extreme example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">Beloved Smother</a>.

After Bart calls him on the phone with new concerning Samantha, Mr. Stanky shows up to the Simpson residence and immediately goes up Bart's treehouse. Shock to see Milhouse and Samantha together, he let's out a prolonged "Noooooooooooooo!" that is powerful enough to make birds flee from the tree. Mr. Stanky then snatches her out of the tree and nervously asks her what happened. Before Samantha can even fully explain, he yells at her. As Mr. Stanky carries her off on his back, he tells her that she will be put in an all-girl school and that she will never see Milhouse again. After Milhouse and Samantha cry out for each other, Mr. Stanky puts her in the car, slams the door, and bitterly drives off, leaving Milhouse heart-broken.

When he's dropping her off, Krabs runs out the door screaming "GET AWAY FROM ME PRECIOUS FLOWER!!!"... which turns out to be an actual flower that SpongeBob was in danger of stepping on. Also, another episode has Krabs worried sick that boys will show up to his daughter's sleepover, though his overriding concern isn't anything the boys would do to Pearl, but the thought that boys would destroy any of his property and beloved possessions. It should also be noted that in the prom episode, Mr. Krabs totally subverts the trope by telling <em>Pearl</em> not to mess <em>SpongeBob</em> up too much. (because he needs him for work)

When an exasperated April finally completes the tasks, Mrs. Jones becomes much nicer, even inviting April to call her "Mom", implying that the whole thing was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> to see if April's devotion to Casey was strong enough that she'd be willing to go through anything for him.
