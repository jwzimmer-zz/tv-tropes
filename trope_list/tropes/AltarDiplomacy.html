</p><p>The common setup is a political marriage to seal a peace or reinforce an alliance between nations or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Feuding Families</a> but in modern fiction, it's becoming more common for the spouses in question to be representatives of family-owned companies or other business interests, and instead of a treaty it becomes a merger. Both parties will typically go into a political marriage with their eyes open, and both parties (or the factions they represent) will typically benefit, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedSpouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedSpouse">the spouses may not be happy in their married life</a>. This isn't always necessarily mutual; one side may be marrying for politics while the other is marrying for money, for instance.
</p><p>This has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for much of human history. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove">Marrying for love</a> was uncommon for those with status, and a good match was often one that benefited both families politically or in business.

<ul><li> The last independent Prince of Meara negotiated a marriage between his eldest daughter and the Haldane king of Gwynedd, in hopes that his principality would be protected from rivals. Others among his nobility (including his wife) valued Meara's independence more than any hoped-for security, and decades of intermittent rebellion followed. Kelson attempted to solve this problem by his "marrying Meara" with disastrous results; he later arranged two other marriages with descendants of the old Mearan royal line with better success.
</li><li> Kelson is also said to have arranged a pair of marriages between members of his family and those of the Torenthi royal family. The <em>Codex</em> notes that Liam-Lajos and his sister marry a couple of Kelson's near relatives. This seems to be part of his long-term plan to resolve the long-standing conflict between Gwynedd and Torenth.
</li><li> King Donal Haldane himself twice married princesses from neighbouring kingdoms, and he arranged the marriage of Alyce de Corwyn with Kenneth Morgan. Kenneth was loyal to Donal and "a safe pair of hands" to protect the wealthy and strategically-placed Duchy of Corwyn. Alyce herself knew and understood the king would decide her choice of husband, especially after deaths in the ducal family line left her the only heir.

</li><li> King Andur of Chaldor is married to Ryadne, the daughter of the chief of the Dur, another Highlander clan. Their marriage appears to be partially a love match (at the least, Ryadne respects Andur), but the fact that it gained Chaldor the loyalty of the Dur isn't lost on anyone.

</li><li> Princess Elspeth herself is resigned to a political marriage as part of her duties as Heir... until she thinks about the neighboring kingdoms and realizes that all are either in stable alliances or are Valdemar's enemies, and none really have good candidates for her anyway. Her eventual love-match with Darkwind does help establish a new alliance with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican">Hawkbrothers</a>, but only informally, as she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone">abdicates as Heir</a> to focus on combat magic, and the Hawkbrothers don't have a hereditary authority anyway.
</li><li> Runs all the way through the <em>Last Herald-Mage</em> trilogy, especially in the last book where an elopement between the Heir and his lovebond causes political turmoil. The Heir has to explain that, yes, he's thought this through and there aren't likely to be any good candidates for an alliance marriage for a while. Further, Vanyel fathers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy">Secret Legacy</a> with the consort of King Randale because no one will make an alliance marriage with a king who appears to be impotent (as Randale was).

The latter, however, just wants his peace and Mother Dark has other amorous ambitions. This riles the nobility up so badly they split into two factions (each centered around one of the unwilling spouses-to-be) and start a civil war, creating a situation where the marriage is not only desirable but <em>necessary</em> to bring back peace. To add insult to injury, all of this happens before the backdrop of a culture where it's perfectly normal for nobles to marry for love.

</li></ul></li><li> This is the default expectation for marriages among the nobility in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, to the point where it's considered an oddity that King Aegon "Egg" Targaryen in the backstory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">allowed all of his children to marry for love</a> (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">both short-term and long-term consequences</a>). Specific examples from the main story:
<ul><li> Catelyn Tully of Riverrun was betrothed to Brandon, the heir-apparent of House Stark. Brandon was killed when Robert's Rebellion erupted, making the alliance all the more necessary, so Catelyn had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettleForSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettleForSibling">Settle for Sibling</a> with Brandon's younger brother (and new Lord of Winterfell) Eddard, which luckily turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">Perfectly Arranged Marriage</a>.
</li><li> At the same time, Catelyn's younger sister Lysa was married to Eddard's foster father, Jon Arryn of the Vale. This was mutually very politically beneficial: Arryn was already elderly and badly needed a young and fertile wife to provide an heir; Lysa <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was known to be fertile, having already been pregnant with stepbrother Petyr Baelish's bastard before being forced to induce a miscarriage,</span> so the Tullys got to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> marry off a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever">soiled</a>" daughter for whom it otherwise would have been difficult to arrange a match.</span> Unfortunately, their marriage wound up less perfectly arranged.
</li><li> At around the same time, Robert Baratheon, heir-apparent to Storm's End and House Baratheon, was betrothed to Eddard's sister Lyanna so as to ally the Stormlands with the North, Riverrun, and the Vale. Lyanna died before the match could be consummated and left no other female Stark of a proper age for Robert to marry, but the alliance continued.
</li><li> After the war that put him on the throne, now-King Robert Baratheon married Cersei Lannister, the daughter of a rich and powerful family, on the advice of his foster father Jon Arryn. The Lannisters were a late addition to the alliance that put Robert on the throne, and the hope was that this would cement their loyalty. The Lannisters, for their part, are only too willing to milk the match for political influence. The only person who is truly happy with this marriage is Cersei's father, and neither Cersei nor Robert has ever forgiven the other for not being someone else (Rhaegar and Lyanna, respectively.)
</li><li> Much later, Robert attempts once again to formally ally Baratheon with Stark by formally betrothing his eldest "son" Joffrey to Eddard's eldest daughter Sansa, and informally implying that younger siblings Tommen "Baratheon" and Arya Stark and Myrcella "Baratheon" and Bran Stark might someday be betrothed as well. This is largely to sweeten his offer to name Eddard Stark Hand of the King and have him do the hard work of ruling the realm.
</li><li> Across the Narrow Sea, the exiled Viserys Targaryen marries his sister Daenerys to Khal Drogo in exchange for the use of Drogo's barbarian horde in retaking the Seven Kingdoms. His reward is to be assistance in securing a golden crown, but when his constant demands that Drogo hold up his end of the bargain become insults at the Dothraki way of life, the Khal gives him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a molten crown instead.</span>
</li><li> Danaerys tries again later with Hizdahr zo Loraq in Meereen. He fares better than his show counterpart in survival if not romance, but he's implied to be involved with the Sons of the Harpy and it isn't likely to end well for him.
</li><li> In the early days of the War of the Five Kings, King Robert's younger brother Renly, Lord of Storm's End, marries Margaery Tyrell to secure the wealthy and powerful Tyrell family's support in pressing his claim to the throne. Margaery is only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">The Beard</a>; it is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">Open Secret</a> that Renly is already quite literally in bed with the Tyrells in the person of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Margaery's brother Loras</a>.
</li><li> Renly's well-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">proclivities</a> mean that after his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> death</span>, Margaery could be remarried to Joffrey <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and, later, Tommen</span> "Baratheon" as part of the Tyrells' shift of allegiance to the Lannisters.
</li><li> Around this same time, Myrcella "Baratheon" is engaged to Trystane Martell in order to keep Dorne allied with the crown. Although they are both quite young, both appear to enjoy the match.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> by Stannis Baratheon; it's never mentioned what the original political advantage of his marriage to Selyse Florent was, but during the War of the Five Kings it doesn't even get him the support of her entire House, many of whom stay loyal to their liege lords the Tyrells.
</li><li> Stannis' Hand of the King, Alester Florent, plots to betroth Stannis' daughter and heir Shireen Baratheon to her "cousin" Tommen in exchange for peace with the Lannisters. Stannis executes him for treason instead.
</li><li> Walder Frey, lord of the Twins, a strategic river crossing, agrees to join King in the North Robb Stark's rebellion against the Iron Throne in exchange for betrothing Robb to a daughter or granddaughter (Frey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">has plenty</a>) of Robb's choosing and Robb's sister Arya to a son or grandson of hers, among other concessions.

It is renewed when Robb's bannerman and uncle Edmure Tully agrees to marry Frey's daughter Roslin <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ...except not really; the wedding is a pretext to lure Robb and his followers to the Twins, where they are slaughtered.</span>
</li><li> Tyrion Lannister is arranged to marry <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sansa</span> so that he will produce a Lannister heir <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who would have a claim to the North. Tyrion, to his credit, sees that the pre-teen Sansa is not ready, and refuses to consummate the marriage</span>.
</li><li> Arianne Martell is afraid her father is trying to force her into this with someone old and abhorrent since he has yet to present her with a match she approves. He reveals only once she has plotted to rebel against his interests that he giving her poor choices as a stalling tactic—he actually wanted to marry her to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Viserys Targaryen and support the return of the old regime, and after Viserys' death sent her brother to Essos to attempt the same alliance with Daenerys instead.</span> Unfortunately, that doesn't work out so well for them either.
</li><li> The Boltons attempt this without even having the right person—they tell everyone the poor girl Ramsay is marrying is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Arya Stark, when in fact it's Jeyne Poole.</span> By this point, everyone in Winterfell who would have known the difference is dead or brainwashed.

</li><li> In the backstory, this was partially the reason for the marriage between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">"The Storm King"</a> Andronicus Valois and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter">Euphrosynia Heterodyne</a>, as it would end the war between Valois' Coalition of the West and the Heterodynes' conquering army. It helped that Andronicus and Euphrosynia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyArrangedMarriage">genuinely liked</a> each other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though he finds out the day of the wedding that he'd been manipulated and it was all a scheme, probably to erode Valois' empire from within.</span>

Both Ina and Yuri (the boy) run away upon learning this, and end up getting to know and like each other without (immediately) knowing who they are to each other.

She was so opposed to the idea that she immediately started trying to antagonize poor Sythe when they met.

Dreamland and Dankmire had been at war for decades, until Zog married Oona as part of a peace agreement; which resulted in the construction of a canal to link the two kingdoms together, along with Oona giving Zog a male heir to Dreamland's throne, Prince Derek.

<div class="indent">"Leave the waging of wars to others! But you, merry Austria, marry; for the realms which Mars awards to others, Venus transfers to you."
<div class="indent">— <em>Habsburg Dynastic Motto</em>
</div></div><ul><li> And the supreme champion within the dynasty is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Karl V von Habsburg<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who through his own marriages and those of his parents inherited Austria, the Habsburg Netherlands, the crown of the Holy Roman Empire and the kingdom of Spain (which included roughly half of Italy and a third of America). In fact, he inherited so many realms that he couldn't manage them all, so he finally abdicated and split his possessions in two, giving the Spanish crown to his son Philip II and the Austrian (and by extension Holy Roman) crown to his brother Ferdinand (and thence to his nephew Maximilian and his wife, Karl's daughter Maria). And thanks to Karl's marriage to the daughter to the King of Portugal, Isabella, Philip II got to inherit <em>that</em> kingdom too along with Spain. Philip II tried to add England (and Ireland and Wales) as well, through marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryTudor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryTudor">Mary Tudor</a>, but failed to produce a heir. Eventually, the Spanish Habsburgs decided not to allow another family to take their holdings through the same means, and started marrying among themselves (and occasionally their Austrian cousins) only. Within a few generations, this inbreeding drove them extinct—and passed the Spanish throne to another family (the French House of Bourbon) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">based on one of the few outside marriages they had allowed</a> (between Philip IV's daughter Maria Theresa and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a>—though not before the Austrian Habsburgs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheSpanishSuccession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheSpanishSuccession">tried to nab it for themselves</a>).
