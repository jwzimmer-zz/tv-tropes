</div></div><p>This is what happens when a song with lyrics which are intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">ironic</a> is (ironically) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">used unironically</a> in the soundtrack of a show, demonstrating either ignorance or willful misuse by the producers.
</p><p>Commercials are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong">major offenders</a>. The worst examples of that so far happened when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth">Smash Mouth</a>'s "Walkin' on the Sun" became a jingle for Mercury, and General Mills' rewrite of Melanie Safka's "What Have They Done to My Song, Ma" to "Look What They Done to My Oatmeal".
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>A similar effect is when a song with an upbeat melody is used as background music in upbeat scenes despite having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">very dark lyrics</a>. This sort is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance">Soundtrack Dissonance</a> of the other kind. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>'s "Bad Moon Rising", and as a parody, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricIdle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EricIdle">Eric Idle</a> (of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a>)'s "Always Look On the Bright Side of Life" are examples.
</p><p>Why does this happen? In many cases, the Dissonance comes between the first verse and the second, or between the verses and the chorus. The problem is that the first verse and chorus are the parts most people remember about a song and the parts most producers use. Sometimes, they only know and use the chorus. In many examples (especially the commercials), the lyrics that cause the dissonance will be excised, leaving only the beat/melody and the more famous individual lines. Once they've got you humming the melody, the song has done its work in associating itself with their product and/or service. The rest of the lyrics don't matter (until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">you head off to the kitchen</a>).

</li><li> Deliberate example in the rich tradition of "badly chosen wedding songs" in <em>45 Years</em>. Kate and Geoff want their first dance played again for their 45th anniversary, and it's obvious that the lyrics aren't foremost in their minds — they refer to it as "our first dance" and "the Platters song", and Kate absent mindedly hums the tune at one point. The film ends with Smoke Gets In Your Eyes playing at the party, and Kate seemingly hearing it properly for the first time — it's about love blinding you to the flaws in a relationship, and it ends in heartbreak.

When one of his victims tells him she recognized that the song he played at the bar was the same one he played when he was raping her, he explains that he played it because it was the music that he chose when he asked for his wife's hand.

</li><li> Idina Menzel in a special mentions how during her appearance in the first season (specifically "Theatricality"), the touching reunion song with her daughter being "Poker Face" by Lady Gaga seemed odd, to say the least. Special attention was given to the bridge's lyrics.
</li><li> The season 3 episode "I Kissed a Girl" has the girls performing the homonymous song during Santana's coming out, immediately after attacking a boy for not taking lesbianism seriously. While the song is actually about bicuriosity, all of the lines that explicitly refer to that aspect (like the ones mentioning a boyfriend) are given to Rachel, who is straight.
</li><li> Having Finn sing "Losing My Religion" in "Grilled Cheesus" while having a crisis of faith, even though that song isn't about religion (as Michael Stipe noted, it's Southern slang for losing one's patience).
</li><li> Having Puck and Finn sing "Glory Days" during graduation in the season 3 finale, when that song is about mocking people who are fixated on high school.
</li><li> Having Mercedes sing "Spotlight" in "Asian F" about her desire for the spotlight, when it's about a woman in an abusive relationship.

(more on that in the Politics folder). As stated in the celebrity-packed song at the end of the statement:
<div class="indent">You always take our songs out of context anyway
</div><div class="indent">Why would Reagan be playing "Born in the U.S.A."?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>It's about Vietnam!</strong>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>: If you listen to more than just the refrain, "You Are My Sunshine" by Jimmie Davis is about how the love of the singer's life has left him, and how miserable he is, and how she'll never be happy without him. The Doctor likes to sing this to Seven of Nine (or have her sing it to him) as a love song. Played hauntingly straight in one episode where the Doctor had his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChip">ethical subroutines</a> removed. At that point, he was experimenting with her borg implants, forcing her to vocally sing along with him. He seemed to be well aware of the song's meaning.

</li><li> In the episode "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge", Otto proposes to Becky by playing "Every Rose Has its Thorn" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Poison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Poison">Poison</a>, which is actually a breakup song.
</li><li> In "Bart Gets an Elephant", Marge suggests that Bart listen to the radio to help him get through his chores of cleaning the house. The song playing is Tennessee Ernie Ford's "Sixteen Tons", a song about being financially enslaved in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown">Company Town</a>. The irony is not lost on Bart.

Followed by a ride home in the Mercedes-Benz?</span>
<ul><li> The Citreon C4 Cactus struck a similar bum note, for those who know what the song is about, when they plundered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starship">Jefferson Airplane</a>'s <em>White Rabbit</em> to back the advert. As this song extols an chemically-assisted altered state of consciousness where Grace Slick on acid would be every bit as dangerous in a car as Janis Joplin with a skinful of Jack Daniels, it is legitimate to wonder if the advertisers had actually listened to the song...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthTheBook">Earth (The Book)</a></em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">Daily Show</a></em> writers call this "the precise moment when culture and commercialism stopped fighting and started making sweet, sweet love."
</li><li> The use of the Pogues "Sunnyside of the Street" by Mercedes-Benz. The song sounds cheery.. until Shane McGowan starts singing about his heart full of hate and a lust for vomit, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5Rwvv0IzVA">as the happy family scoot around in their Cadillac<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. They should've just used the musical intro (it is very cheerful and peppy).
</li></ul></li><li> The Parachute Club's LGBT anthem "Rise Up!", used for McCain pizza dough.
</li><li> John Mellencamp's "Pink Houses" ("Ain't that America"), in innumerable vaguely patriotic car commercials. Face it  even if you know the truth about the song, it <em>still</em> sounds vaguely patriotic.
<ul><li> YMMV; it actually <em>is</em> an extremely patriotic and idealistic song, it just might disagree with some people's politics.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Zoom Zoom" jingle that appears in Mazda's commercials is actually an old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Capoeira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Capoeira">Capoeira</a> song which goes "Zum Zum Zum, capoeira mata um", which, given that capoeira is Brazilian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler">Dance Battling</a>, roughly means "Zoom Zoom Zoom, Capoeira (can) kill you, or (Capoeira kills someone)". Mazda carefully excises all this nonsense about Capoeira, natch  all they care about is the zoom, zoom, zooming.
</li><li> A Brazilian shopping mall TV ad used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilyAllen">Lily Allen</a>'s "The Fear" as backgound music, but the song's lyrics include, "I want lots of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds/I heard people die while they are trying to find them". To be fair, they only used the chorus, which goes "I don't know what's right or what's real anymore".
</li><li> The late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> suffered from this <strong>a lot</strong>  ever since his work first got mass media attention. In 2008, all the trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Milk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Milk">Milk</a></em> (a biographical movie about Harvey Milk, the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in California, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors) used Bowie's song "Queen Bitch" (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HunkyDory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HunkyDory">Hunky Dory</a></em>), which raises unfortunate questions about how the marketing team felt about the film's subject. Then there was the jeans commercial that put videos of masculine men to the song "The Jean Genie" (<em>Aladdin Sane</em>). The only appropriate response is "You're all aware the song is about gay sex, right?"
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity">Space Oddity</a>". It's about an astronaut lost in the empty void of space forever  or rather until his eventual cremation by re-entry  sung in a tone quite appropriate for describing such a fate, and the Ground Control guy sounds plainly hopeless by the end. The BBC used "Space Oddity", when it was originally released in 1969, as part of its coverage of the moon landing. A car commercial by Lincoln used a cover of "Space Oddity" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CatPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CatPower">Cat Power</a>. The ad proper pushes the technology of the car and how "futuristic" it looks. It cuts off after "you've really made the grade".
</li><li> Another in the same series of commercials uses the cover of "Major Tom (Coming Home)" by Shiny Toy Guns (originally recorded by Peter Schilling), and it cuts off right after "Earth below us / Drifting, falling..." While it's a very cool commercial, it's not hard to say, "Uh, you know that song <em>doesn't end well</em>, right?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>"Across the stratosphere / a final message / 'give my wife my love' / then nothing more..."</em> The 'drifting, falling' part becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">Ironic Echo</a>  the same words meant something totally different on the way <em>up</em>, didn't they?</span>
</li></ul></li><li> "Happy Happy Joy Joy" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy">Ren &amp; Stimpy</a></em>, a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweet">saccharine</a> kids' cartoon songs, was used sincerely to sell Sara Lee products.
</li><li> An Australian car commercial used <em>Polka</em> by Yves Klein Blue, a song about drug addiction, and how it can destroy people. Which goes from light and soft to screaming freak out. Needless to say, only the first few seconds were used as mood music.
</li><li> A series of Wrangler jeans commercials used the first lines ("Some folks are born, made to wave the flag, Ooh they're red white and blue") of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>'s song "Fortunate Son" (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillyAndThePoorBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillyAndThePoorBoys">Willy and the Poor Boys</a></em>) superimposed with patriotic images. They pointedly left out the next line: "But when the band plays 'Hail to the Chief,' Oooh they point the cannon at you". The song is lambasting people who proclaim their patriotism while expecting others to make the sacrifices for the country (and was specifically targeted at David Eisenhower, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight's</a> grandson and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s son-in-law).
<ul><li> It doesn't help that the <em>chorus</em> says, vehemently (and often) "it ain't me". If anything, the song is telling you not to buy what's on the commercial.
</li></ul></li><li> Commercials for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHistoryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHistoryChannel">The History Channel</a> use the Matchbox 20 song "How Far We've Come," which contains the lyrics "Let's see how far we've come" ...and ignores the lyrics that come before it:
<div class="indent"> "I believe the world <br/>is coming to an end <br/>Oh well, I guess <br/>we're gonna pretend <br/>let's see how far we've come".
</div><ul><li> They're oddly apropos for the History Channel, especially considering their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">newfound love</a> of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">the end of the world</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DocumentaryOfLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DocumentaryOfLies">the pretend</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There has been an advert for Pizza Hut's "Twisted Crust" which used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a>' jolly, upbeat "Twisting". It was pulled really quickly because, when you listen properly, the lyric actually goes "She wants to see you again / Twisting, slowly twisting / In the wind..." Possibly hanging from a skyhook, even.
</li><li> "Bohemian Like You" by the Dandy Warhols has been used more than once in car adverts by virtue of the first line, which goes "You've got a great car". The <em>second</em> line, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">"Yeah, what's wrong with it today?"</a>, is rarely played.
</li><li> Stylized commercials for American mega-store Target featured Devo's "Beautiful World"  a song mocking the consumer culture the ad intended to glorify.
<ul><li> It was also featured on a Starbucks compilation CD aimed at children, oddly titled <em>Songs for Little Hipsters</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> "Mack the Knife", a song from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheThreepennyOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheThreepennyOpera">incredibly anti-capitalist musical</a>, detailing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">a businessman who murders people to further his own gains</a>, was once used <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Tonight">in a marketing campaign for<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a>. The lyrics were completely rewritten, at least.
</li><li> A series of Gerber commercials use "The Winner Is..." from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleMissSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleMissSunshine">Little Miss Sunshine</a></em> (a re-write of the song "How It Ends" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devotchka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devotchka">Devotchka</a>).
</li><li> Nena's "99 Red Balloons" (a song about a <strong>nuclear holocaust</strong>) for a JC Penney Valentine's Day commercial.
<ul><li> There was also a Honda Hybrid commercial featuring the music of the Postal Service's "We Will Become Silhouettes", another song about a nuclear holocaust. Apparently, green energy and atomic super weapons go hand in hand.
</li><li> Ditto for "The Future's So Bright (I Gotta Wear Shades)" by Timbuk3, but at least this one is not quite direct, even though both the lyrics and music video create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> picture in a style rather close to the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em>.
</li><li> A Telus commercial used "99 Red Balloons" as well, though in German so that people not familiar with it can enjoy the song and the 99 pretty red balloons and ignore the whole annihilation bit.
</li></ul></li><li> A car commercial used the titular lines from "Move Along" by All-American Rejects. Cars move you, so "Move Along" is the perfect line... if you are somehow able to ignore the fact that in the song, the singer is trying to convince his friend not to commit suicide.
<ul><li> "Move Along" also turned up in some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Lego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Lego">LEGO</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> ads, when Lego had a deal with the band (the story is that the toyline's antagonists kidnapped the band and forced them to play private concerts). At least <em>there</em> it was <strong>slightly</strong> less out of place... but only just: on the one hand, the heroes of the story are trying to prevent a death. On the other, the song's still being used with kid's toys.
</li><li> Speaking of suicide in car commercials, one for Hyundai prominently features "Today" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>, which incidentally features irony in a prominent manner: the song talks about the greatest day of the narrator's life... because he's going to kill himself tomorrow. Presumably using his Hyundai in a closed garage.
</li></ul></li><li> Another car company used "Turn It On Again" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a> in one of their commercials  a song about a man who lives vicariously through his television and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>.
<ul><li> The same band's "Tonight Tonight Tonight", a song about a paranoid junkie making a drug deal late at night, was also used for a famous Michelob beer commercial.
</li><li> After "Jesus He Knows Me" was released, the Christian TV station, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBN">the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN)</a>, figured the band had discovered religion and picked up the song's video to air, but they decided not to after learning that the song is actually about a televangelist who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">lives a decadent, corrupt lifestyle</a> off the donations from his viewers.
</li></ul></li><li> British furniture retailer DFS have just started a new TV ad campaign using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nickelback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nickelback">Nickelback</a>'s <em>Rockstar</em>. On the surface, it seems to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantSong">"I Want" Song</a>, but the lyrics are about the shallowness of materialism and instant gratification. The ads offer interest-free credit.
<ul><li> Speaking of instant gratification, "Rockstar" got used to promote Ameristar Casinos.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IggyPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IggyPop">Iggy Pop</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LustForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LustForLife">Lust for Life</a></em> for a cruise line. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebOriginal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebOriginal">Web Original</a> for a parody of this created by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/TheOnion">The Onion</a></em>.
<ul><li> Or anything else that it has ever been used in an advertisement for.
</li></ul></li><li> Celebrity Cruises also used the highly inappropriate "Fame" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoungAmericans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoungAmericans">Young Americans</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFT219kNGro">one of their commercials<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. What they probably didn't realize is that the song is a bitter rant about the perils of fame.
<ul><li> It's also been used to advertise Cadillac cars, which could almost cross the line into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">Stealth Parody</a> on the part of the ad agency.
</li></ul></li><li> The Whitlams' "You Gotta Love This City" for a Sydney Olympics-related tourism campaign. It's about a man who commits suicide <em>expressly because Sydney has won the bid to host the Olympic Games</em>. The full title lyric, not given until halfway through the song, runs: "You gotta love this city / For its body and not its brain..."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTimesTheyAreAChangin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTimesTheyAreAChangin">The Times They Are A-Changin'</a></em>," as sung by masses of children running through wheat fields, was used by a multinational bank.
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickMercer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickMercer">Rick Mercer</a></strong>: If you listen closely, you can hear the sound of Woodie Guthrie spinning in his grave.
</div></li><li> A strange one is a car commercial soundtracked by "Blindness" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFall">The Fall</a>. Considering that The Fall are known for being a band that makes rather uncommercial music, it's especially baffling that this car company chose "Blindness", a song that begins with the line "I was <em>walking</em> down the street".
</li><li> The song "All I Want for Christmas is You", featuring lines like "I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree", is inexplicably popular in adverts trying to sell those presents.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>' "Start Me Up" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TattooYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TattooYou">Tattoo You</a></em> was famously used by Microsoft for the Windows 95 launch. The lyrics include the well-known refrain "You make a grown man cry." Anyone who used Windows 95 would find that line <em>very</em> apt...
<ul><li> Of course, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">why the speaker is crying</a>, it's possible that Microsoft knew the context and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a>.
</li><li> A popular urban legend states that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger">Mick Jagger</a> ran into Bill Gates at a party, quoted him an enormously inflated price as a joke... and Gates wrote him a check on the spot.
</li><li> The line starting with "I can't compete..." also seemed appropriate when Microsoft got accused of monopolization.
</li><li> "Start Me Up" is now being used by Toyota. One has to wonder if "Start me up / I'll never stop" really is the right kind of lyrics for a car company that had a problem with their cars <em>accelerating and not stopping</em> because of a pedal defect.
</li></ul></li><li> The NFL Network used a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Morrissey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Morrissey">Morrissey</a>'s "Everyday is Like Sunday" in its commercials. Let's just say that Morrissey didn't actually like Sundays that much.
</li><li> A 2008 commercial for the Ford Edge used the lyricless parts from a Band of Horses song to background a sweet scene of a girl driving through the city at night and then meeting up with her man for dinner. The song was The Funeral, about the inevitability of death.
</li><li> A commercial for the Ford Transit used an extract of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoulCoughing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoulCoughing">Soul Coughing</a>'s "Disseminated"; while the segment used is from later in the song, the opening verse of the full song describes a goat that ate a tin can and "shat out a Ford Sedan".
</li><li> The apocalyptic anthem <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling">London Calling</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a> being used to hawk Jaguars.
<ul><li> It was also used in tourist adverts for visiting London.
<ul><li> And then for <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14324385">promoting the 2012 London summer Olympics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

If you'll listen to the intro, you'll know it's used in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ0kZYz9ntw">Garnier Fructis Shampoo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> commercials. If you listen to the rest of it, you'll know why the guys who make those commercials <em>haven't</em>.
</li><li> Kohl's department stores have adopted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies">Barenaked Ladies</a>' "Shopping" as an ad jingle, either not knowing or not caring about the song's satiric anti-consumerist thrust.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan">Steely Dan</a>'s song "Do It Again" from "Can't Buy A Thrill" has been used in a PBS commercial encouraging contribution to public broadcasting. They had the good sense to only use the instrumental opening, but it's no less a puzzling choice for that  considering the song is about destructive habits.
</li><li> In an inversion of the many examples on this page of violent, un-PC songs being used in innocent contexts, a number of tobyMac songs (mostly "The Slam") have been used in previews for violent movies and shows, despite said songs being about God. Although, "The Slam" was written by tobyMac after he saw <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePassionOfTheChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePassionOfTheChrist">The Passion of the Christ</a></em>, which is pretty violent.
</li><li> In the trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaceToWitchMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaceToWitchMountain">Race to Witch Mountain</a></em>, Disney used the guitar solo from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOffspring">The Offspring</a>'s "Stuff Is Messed Up", which has some seriously kid-unfriendly lyrics.

<div class="indent">Hell's vengeance is boiling in my heart, <br/>Death and despair are aflame all around me! <br/>If you fail to cause Sarastro's pangs of death <br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">You will no longer be my daughter!</a>
</div></li><li> A 2004 ad for the Volkswagen Touareg featured "Ariel Ramirez", a song by Richard Buckner about doing heroin.
</li><li> For several years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie">Barbie</a> was advertised with "Barbie Girl" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aqua" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aqua">Aqua</a>. Granted, they've changed most of the lyrics, but still... Interestingly, Mattel were furious about the song when it first came out and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel_v._MCA_Records">sued Aqua's record company<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but, on appeal from summary judgment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts">the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Kozinski, J</a>, for a unanimous panel) "advise[d] the parties to chill." Apparently, they did.
</li><li> A Best Buy commercial a few years back used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SherylCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SherylCrow">Sheryl Crow</a>'s "Soak up the Sun" for their summer sale. This is a song about a poor girl who "don't have digital... don't have diddly squat" and knows "It's not having what you want/it's wanting what you've got."
<ul><li> Even better, the song's "enjoy what you have, don't spend excessively" must have gone completely over the heads of American Express, who used it in a commercial for a credit card.
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SherylCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SherylCrow">Sheryl Crow</a> song, "If it Makes You Happy," was used in a car commercial. They only used part of the chorus, which goes "If it makes you happy/it can't be that bad," clearly trying to give the impression that buying a new car is just what your self-esteem needs. They had the foresight to cut off the song right before the last line of the chorus, which is "Then why the hell are you so sad?"
</li></ul></li><li> Toyota used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a> version of "Go West" in some car ads in the early 90s. While the song is infectiously upbeat, it was already a gay anthem to begin with, and the cover dealt with escapism from the AIDS crisis and the fall of the Soviet Union.
</li><li> A TV commercial for Brendan Fraser's <em>Furry Vengeance</em>, a kid's movie, is using Tone Loc's song "Wild Thing". The film is about a bunch of animals trying to stop a housing development, while the song is nothing but pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">Intercourse with You</a>.
<ul><li> Even more bizarre is its use in a trailer for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs">Smurfs</a></em> movie.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> hired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup">Bowling for Soup</a> to redo "I Melt With You" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ModernEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ModernEnglish">Modern English</a>; it has worked its way back into advertising culminating in Hershey's Chocolate using it for a Kiss commercial with a mother and child. All of this ignoring the fact the first two lines are "Moving forward using all my breath/Making love to you was never second best."
<ul><li> Before Hershey's, Ritz crackers used it to similar effect.
</li><li> Not to mention that said song is also about dying in a nuclear holocaust ("melt" being used literally, but it could also be a pun). It's about a couple that have sex as the bombs fall because it's their last moment.
</li><li> To be fair, Disney had them change the line in the remake to "Bein' friends with you was never second best." It was for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SkyHigh2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SkyHigh2005">a children's movie</a>, after all.
</li></ul></li><li> "Angel" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SarahMcLachlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SarahMcLachlan">Sarah McLachlan</a> is about heroin abuse, specifically the fatal overdose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>' touring keyboardist, but is used in a PSA for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. A commercial that is narrated by McLachlan herself.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36gW-IPV0aA">"Beautiful Day"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by English folk-punk band The Levellers has occasionally turned up in adverts based on the chorus "What a beautiful day/I'm the king of all time/And nothing is impossible/In my all powerful mind." Whoever chose the song apparently missed the part after this when it proceeds to talk about instigating a political revolution, the titular "beautiful day".
</li><li> Many-a commercial for a hardware store, office supply store (like Office Depot), or heck, even cars has made use of Bachman Turner Overdrive's "Takin' Care Of Business": "Takin' care of business/and workin' overtime!" However, the song is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockstarSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockstarSong">Rock-Star Song</a> with the singer singing how, since he's in a band, he's <em>not</em> working like every other workaholic out there: "And if you ever get annoyed,/look at me, I'm self-employed/I love to work at nothin' all day!"
</li><li> The O'Jays' "(For the Love of) Money" is a prime example. Commercials <em>love</em> to use the chorus when talking about their (supposed) big savings, but the lyrics themselves talk about the evils that people will do to each other over money.
</li><li> A Jeep car commercial used an instrumental with an intense, pounding beat to sell its pickup trucks. However, said instrumental is the background music to Johnny Cash's "God's Gonna Cut You Down", which is about how there's no such thing as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>.
<ul><li> Some commercials use the first part of the chorus, "You can run on for a long time/run on for a long time." Appropriate for a motor vehicle renowned for reliability. They don't use the last half, "Run on for a long time/Sooner or later God'll cut you down/Sooner or later God'll cut you down," which is not so appropriate.
</li></ul></li><li> The Muffs' cover of "Kids in America", used by Kraft to shill American cheese singles. The Muffs' "Everywhere I Go" (which was about stalking) was also used in a Fruitopia commercial.
</li><li> Pretty much <em>any</em> usage of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd">Sweet Home Alabama</a>" for <em>anything</em>, but one just has to wonder what the hell KFC was thinking when they started using it to shill fried chicken. Especially since the K stands for <em>Kentucky</em>.
</li><li> Apparently nobody at the Boston Globe's advertising department bothered to listen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DropkickMurphys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DropkickMurphys">Dropkick Murphys</a> <em>The State of Massachusetts</em>. The song is about drugs destroying a family and the children being taken away. The title of the song comes from who now has custody of the children.
</li><li> British restaurant chain Harvester produced a TV spot using the Isley Brothers' single "Harvest for the World" as its soundtrack. Thus we see scenes of smiling families tucking into plates of glistening, fatty food... all to the strains of a song about famine, greed, and war.
</li><li> One TV spot in Mastercard's long-running "priceless" campaign, played in the run-up to Valentine's Day, used Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a Woman". The song's lyrics detail the heartache and self-destruction that can come with love, and includes lines about how a man will "spend his very last dime trying to hold on to what he needs".
</li><li> Red Stripe is promoting Red Stripe Light beer by having a group of Bobby McFerrin wannabes dancing and singing a reggae cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">Frankie Goes To Hollywood's "Relax".</a>
<ul><li> "Boo, bad use of a song in a commercial! Hooray, Beer!"
</li><li> One has to wonder if this example was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, considering it's the same guys who once made a commercial based around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">how ugly the shape of their bottles are</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The advertising campaign for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> was infamous for using "This Is The New Shit" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a>, likely in an attempt to show that the game was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> than previous Western fantasy RPGs. The lyrics are mostly mocking fans craving innovation, while producers crank out the same old material with big helpings of sex, violence, and grittiness in order to appeal to the audience's baser instincts. Of course, this was back in the day when Bioware still had a sense of humor about itself, so it may well have been intentional.
</li><li> A late 2010 Subaru minivan commercial uses the Pogues' "If I Should Fall From Grace With God".
</li><li> A commercial for HP photo printers features a baby zipping through the countryside in his little wheeled cart that helps babies learn to walk. It's cute, to be sure, with the little baby flying down the road while a jaunty tune plays in the background. That jaunty tune? "Brand New Key" by Melanie Safka (the same person who wrote the song listed in this trope's description). A song about getting laid. Tip for advertisers: when people see commercials with cute little babies in them, they probably don't want to be reminded at that moment just <em>how</em> they're made. Interestingly, a tale from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Safka herself</a> gives a slightly different interpretation of the lyrics. She was on this vegan diet that mainly involved distilled water, until an "inner voice" told her to eat at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a>. She started writing the song on the way home from there.
</li><li> A trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKarateKid2010">The Karate Kid (2010)</a></em> uses the refrain from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FortMinor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FortMinor">Fort Minor</a>'s "Remember the Name", a song that has nothing to do with fighting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoastfulRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoastfulRap">isn't particularly kid-friendly</a>.
</li><li> A cell phone commercial about how wonderful their new contracts are, using the refrain from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf">Meat Loaf</a>'s "Paradise by the Dashboard Light", "I would love you to the end of time!", ignoring the next stanza: "So now I'm praying for the end of time / To hurry up and arrive / Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you / I don't think that I can really survive."
</li><li> The trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat 9</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gametrailers.com/video/pax-10-mortal-kombat/703859">revealed at PAX 10<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is probably guilty of this, being set to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed">Disturbed</a>'s "Another Way to Die", which made a blatant point of highlighting the lyric "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">It's just another way to die!</a>" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowDiscretionShot">shadowy violence all-throughout</a>). Aggressive as as it may sound, the lyric is environmental in nature, meant to describe the consequences of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">people's treatment of the Earth</a>.
</li><li> GE used Tennessee Ernie Ford's version of "Sixteen Tons" for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1A146sANdg">their advert for clean coal.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The song depicts life of a coal miner under the truck system. Under this system, workers were paid with exchangeable credit vouchers for goods at the company store. This made it impossible for workers to store up cash savings. Workers also usually lived in company-owned dormitories or houses, the rent for which was automatically deducted from their pay. "St. Peter don't call me 'cause I can't go/I owe my soul to the company store." It was also used in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> article (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebOriginal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebOriginal">Web Original</a> below).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a></em> ran adverts featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>' "Gimme Shelter" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeggarsBanquet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeggarsBanquet">Beggars Banquet</a></em>. Apparently a song depicting the horrors of war, which will eventually end all life on the planet, is supposed to encourage people to play as Black Op soldiers. That said, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> franchise itself has had a history of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">anti-war</a>, yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">simultaneously being pro-war, due to being a fun video game about the subject.</a> So, while still contradictory, the advertisers were probably well aware of the song's meaning. <em>Black Ops</em> is also set during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> particularly  many of the soldiers fighting the war didn't particularly want to be there and would often play contemporary anti-war rock music being well aware of the irony; indeed, the first level of the game actually set in Vietnam starts with "Fortunate Son" playing over the radio. The producers probably knew exactly what they were doing.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuOW4oalG70">This advert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the Fiat 500 uses "This Is The Life" by Amy MacDonald. It would be bad enough if they'd used one of the verses (which describe apparent good times) and conveniently ignored the chorus (which is a "reveal" of the misery that the person the song is addressed to is trying to run away from), but they've gone straight for the most miserable part of the song, purely for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>. The music behind it isn't even particularly peppy.
</li><li> Finnish hardware store Rautia uses "Vasara ja nauloja" (Hammer and nails), a song about a man failing to build a house, in its commercials to promote how successful you are with their tools.
</li><li> Early ads for the Xbox Kinect used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GangOfFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GangOfFour">Gang of Four</a>'s "Natural's Not In It" (albeit in an edit that did away with lyrics altogether). The song is partially about the futility of trying to find fulfillment through consumerism, so its presence in an ad for nearly <em>anything</em> would fit this trope to some extent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LGBTFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LGBTFanbase">LGBT Fanbase</a> aside, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVillagePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVillagePeople">YMCA</a>", a song about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysArePromiscuous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysArePromiscuous">dudes having sex at the YMCA</a>, in ads for... the YMCA. To be honest, it's the one pop culture phenomenon ever to recognize their existence. Also, even though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendre</a> is obvious, the surface meaning (a place where folks can go have a workout or swim or socialize or find social services) remains true and is quite complimentary of it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a>'s revamp, which added pseudo-functioning credit cards to the game design, was advertised using Jessie J's "Price Tag", a song about how people <em>shouldn't</em> be driven by greed. They did change the lyrics, though whether or not that made it better or even worse is anyone's guess.
</li><li> Coke ads for the Olympics and Australian supermarket Coles using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia">Sia</a>'s "Breathe Me", a song about depression, self-harm, or attempted suicide. Granted, they only used the instrumental part after the lyrics end.
</li><li> "Just What I Needed" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars">The Cars</a> is about someone who <em>definitely</em> doesn't feel like they need the other person. This was used in Circuit City commercials for items that supposedly <em>were</em> needed.
<ul><li> Similarly, "Good Times Roll", a song about celebrity gossip, was used in a credit card commercial about cash-back deals.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU35arDCHZo">A 2011 Lexus ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> uses the song "Odessa" by Canadian indietronica artist Caribou, and understandably, the sexy, fashion-show-worthy beat and tune would fit to a sexy couple driving in their car to a masquerade party. Yet the song is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">a woman who constantly gets physically and sexually abused and cheated on by her boyfriend</a>, with lyrics like this:

</li><li> Target attempted to license Adam Freeland's anti-consumerist song "We Want Your Soul". Apparently, Target only must have listened to the lines "here's popcorn, here's magazines, here's milkshakes, here's blue jeans", while conveniently ignoring the rest of the song, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillHicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillHicks">Bill Hicks</a> sample comparing modern culture to bread and circuses, and <em>the title itself</em>. Luckily, Freeland turned down the offer.
</li><li> A promo for ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToddlersAndTiaras" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToddlersAndTiaras">Toddlers &amp; Tiaras</a> used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a>'s "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornThisWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornThisWay">Born This Way</a>", a song about accepting who you are and not having to change... while showing shots of children around the age of five wearing makeup and false eyelashes. Then again, the show actually manages to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointAndLaughShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointAndLaughShow">snarky editing</a>, doing things like showing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">a pageant mom</a> saying, "Oh, my little angel loves doing pageants!" and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut">cutting to the little girl bawling and begging not to do it anymore</a>. So ironic music use fits right in.
</li><li> "Bring Me Down" by Lenka was used for a Dulux paint ad in Canada in early 2012, in which a woman is unsatisfied with her bleak-looking living room and cheerfully paints it red while her husband is set aside. The lyrics tells of a woman drifting apart from her partner, criticizing him that he's done nothing while their relationship crumbled, and that she needs to leave before she falls right back into his arms. The lyrics are <em>surprisingly close</em> to what is being depicted... except for the happy ending, of course.
</li><li> In 2012, Chevrolet Argentina (a GM brand) <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKLkErXmHaE">put up a commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for their new S10 pick-up truck, picturing it in different country-fair expositions (coal-mining fairs, yerba mate fairs, etc; common events in the countryside of Argentina), showing it being used in tough-as-nails jobs, with a voice-over narrating fragments of a poem describing how strong and powerful the truck was ("You are a superb and proud specimen of your kind/And whether taming horses/Or killing tigers/You are an Alexander/Nebuchadnezzar"). The poem, "A Roosevelt", by Rubén Darío, is an anti-imperialist poem about how Latin America isn't going to fall to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s USA without a fight. It is one of the most famous anti-American-imperialism pieces in Latin American left-wing literature. Considering that GM is an American brand, and even more, considering that it is now partially owned by the US government, one wonders if the marketing people were being ironic or just didn't read the whole thing through.
</li><li> One ad for the SPCA used <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertaFlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertaFlack">Roberta Flack</a>'s touching yet slightly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">intercoursey</a> love song "The First Time That Ever I Saw Your Face" to promote the rescue of abused animals. While the SPCA does want the viewers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">to love their rescued animals</a>, they probably do not want them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">to love the animals in that other way</a>.
</li><li> "You Found Me" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFray">The Fray</a> was used to advertise a made-for-TV movie about a couple trying to find each other. Sounds good... except that the song is about finding God after a long and difficult series of events.
</li><li> British Airways are using "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LondonCalling">London Calling</a>" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a> to <em>encourage</em> people to come to London for the Olympics. That's the song about how London is a horrible city, and will only get worse after the apocalypse.
<div class="indent">London calling, now don't look at us, <br/>All that phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust. <br/>London calling, see we ain't got no swing <br/>'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing.
</div></li><li> "Intuition" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jewel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jewel">Jewel</a> was mostly about the hollowness of popular culture and commercialism. It also takes a few shots at objectification and sexuality in advertising (this is more prominent in the video). After the song's commercial failure, it was eventually licensed to ads for Schick razors.
</li><li> The 2012 NFL season has seen a series of Bud Light commercials that celebrate fans with strange little traditions that they believe will improve their team's performance... set to "Superstition" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingBook">Talking Book</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder">Stevie Wonder</a>. Not surprisingly, the commercials always end before getting to the line "When you believe in things that you don't understand, then you suffer"  except in the long versions, where that line and the one immediately following it ("Superstition ain't the way") <em>are</em> included.
</li><li> "Inner Ninja" by Classified was used in an ad for Tim Horton's Iced Caps. Not as ironic as some examples, but it is using a song about overcoming struggles in a commercial about refreshments in summertime.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornInTheUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornInTheUSA">Born In The USA</a></em> is regularly used as a rallying cry to American greatness (as in one of Ronald Reagan's Presidential ads), when it's actually about a homeless Vietnam vet's alienation from his country now that he's home again.
</li><li> Australian ads for phone company Vodafone at one point featured 'Awkward' by indie band San Cisco, a song about being stalked by someone both in person and through repetitive text messaging. Awkward indeed.
</li><li> The Isley Brothers' "It's Your Thing" is commonly used in commercials and movie trailers for playful expressions of individuality and acts of self-expression. The song itself is about how a woman can make love with whomever she chooses "I can't tell you/Who to sock it to!". You can probably guess by now what the "thing" in question is.
</li><li> Very shortly after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed">Lou Reed</a>'s death, the song "Perfect Day" (a song that most agree came out of his mixed feelings of pain, pleasure, hate, and affection for his own addiction to heroin), from his 1972 album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Transformer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Transformer">Transformer</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0d9d-cdxhk">was used to advertise the PS4.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The idea presumably was something like "it's a perfect day when you play the PS4 with your friends, as long as you are able to ignore the song's darker undertones."
<ul><li> Given that the ad in question shows the singer being brutalized in the various video game scenarios he's inserted himself into (while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity">never going off key</a>), the advertisers may have been well aware of the song's undertones, even if they're not the same ones specifically.
</li></ul></li><li> To celebrate the then-upcoming release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">the 50th film</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Tangled</a></em>) in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> released a video which featured a countdown of all 50 films using Brandi Carlile's song "Dreams". While dreams (of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">"a wish your heart makes"</a> variety) are featured heavily as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Motif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Motif">Motif</a> in the canon, the song, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, refers to... let's just say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EroticDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EroticDream">a very different kind of dream.</a>
</li><li> A 2014 commercial for Geico advertising motorcycle insurance made use of "One Headlight" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWallflowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWallflowers">The Wallflowers</a>. While the title does refer to what most motorcycles have (two of the motorcycles in the commercial have two headlights, however), the song is actually about the singer reminiscing about his best friend's death and how it affects him.
<ul><li> Later, they would advertise motorcycle insurance using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop">ZZ Top</a>'s La Grange. Sure the song has a driving beat that sounds good over footage of a bike, but it's also a song about a brothel.
</li></ul></li><li> iPhone commercials are usually notorious for misusing songs, but a particularly notorious example is the 2014 <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/ODmfmUWqlSA">"Powerful"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> advert, which features a bunch of teenage girls singing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SurferRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SurferRosa">Gigantic</a>"  a song that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states is about interracial romance but is commonly interpreted to be about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggusDickus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggusDickus">a big black dick</a></em>  by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePixies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePixies">The Pixies</a>.
</li><li> A (hard to find) 2006 commercial for Trojan condoms uses "Let Love In" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GooGooDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GooGooDolls">Goo Goo Dolls</a>. A song about setting aside anger and letting positivity enter our hearts is the perfect soundtrack for selling what <em>prevents</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">love</a> from being let in.
</li><li> A Kia Soul commercial uses the song "Animals" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Maroon5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Maroon5">Maroon 5</a>. The song compares <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">Intercourse with You</a>... to <em>animals killing and eating each other</em>. Admittedly, it does become rather fitting when you see that said ad is about the Kia hamsters working in a lab and turning a hamster in a ball into <strong>a humanoid hamster dominatrix</strong>.
</li><li> "Bitter Sweet Symphony" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVerve">The Verve</a> was used extensively on TV for things such as news reports and sports highlights. The strings are apparently too uplifting for anyone to care about the brooding lyrics, and there's enough time before Richard Ashcroft's vocals kick in that it's usually unnecessary to do any looping.
<ul><li> It was also used in the trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coco">Coco</a></em>. Though if you've actually seen the movie, it actually kind of fits.
</li></ul></li><li> Harry Chapin was fond of telling the story about representatives of the Greyhound Bus company calling to discuss possibly using his song "Take the Greyhound" in their ads. A bemused Chapin asked them, "...have you <em>listened</em> to the song?" It's about how crappy and depressing it is to take a bus trip. Chorus: "Take the Greyhound / It's a dog of a way to get around / Take the Greyhound / It's a dog gone easy way to get you down."
</li><li> A 2015 ad for Honest diapers uses "All About That Bass" by Meghan Trainor.
</li><li> Disney used "Semi-Charmed Life" by Third Eye Blind (a song about <em>doing crystal meth and receiving oral sex</em>) in its ads for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTiggerMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTiggerMovie">The Tigger Movie</a></em>. Unsurprisingly, people took notice and had Disney play a different song over the ads.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimalPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimalPlanet">Animal Planet</a> once used Men at Work's "Who Can It Be Now", a song about a guy who is paranoid and/or being stalked, to advertise a dog show. They just used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleOnlyChorus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleOnlyChorus">chorus</a>, and it was in the context of "who has what it takes?", but still.
<ul><li> That same song was also used with new lyrics in a promo for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaskedSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaskedSinger">The Masked Singer</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The 88th Annual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Awards</a> had a campaign with the tagline, "We all dream in gold", and commercials with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImagineDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImagineDragons">Imagine Dragons</a>' "Dream" playing in the background. These commercials pair up inspirational footage of past winners with... a song warning against getting caught up in selfish and probably unreachable dreams of fame and fortune, which could leave the dreamer oblivious to real-world problems. Indeed, despite the ads' best efforts to edit out the lyrics that make this lesson especially explicit, the line "We all are living in a dream / But life ain't what it seems" somehow made it in.
</li><li> British pharmacy chain store Boots' <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8Ylkpi8k8Y">Christmas advert in 2013<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> featured a boy buying presents for the special people in his life, one of which is for a girl he presumably has a crush on (calling her "the fittest girl in Year 10"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0hfoq');"><sup>notes for non-British readers </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0hfoq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0hfoq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">an attractive 14/15-year-old</span>). The music used is Bronski Beat's <em>Smalltown Boy</em>, a song about a man being rejected by his family for being homosexual.
</li><li> A commercial for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustDance">Just Dance</a> 2018</em> has a woman dancing to "Despacito" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LuisFonsi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LuisFonsi">Luis Fonsi</a> ft. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaddyYankee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaddyYankee">Daddy Yankee</a> (one of the many songs included in the game's tracklist) with her friends, parents, and apparently her grandparents. The problem is, though many non-Spanish speakers don't realize this, the song isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">the type of song you'd probably want to dance to with your mom</a>.
</li><li> An ad for Christian Dior perfume starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman">Natalie Portman</a> uses "Chandelier" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia">Sia</a>  the ad is meant to associate the scent with an epic tale of passionate love, but the song is about alcoholism and the downside of a hard-partying lifestyle. The ad only uses the chorus and pre-chorus of the song, and even then cuts the word "drink" out of the line "one, two, three, drink". Out of context, "I'm gonna swing from the chandelier / I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist" sounds more romantic than self-destructive, so it's only jarring to those who know what the song is actually about.
</li><li> An example that used a speech rather than a song: for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> LII, Ram Trucks put out <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO0VkYgtPHw">an ad<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for their pickups that used quotes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>'s "drum major instinct" sermon, delivered fifty years prior to the day. The problem, as <a class="urllink" href="https://jalopnik.com/the-ram-super-bowl-ad-with-the-martin-luther-king-jr-s-1822715632">immediately noted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by virtually everybody who saw the ad, was that this was not a speech lionizing working-class achievement, as the out-of-context segment used seemed to indicate — it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalismIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalismIsBad">an anti-capitalist sermon</a> criticizing consumerist culture, using the "drum major instinct", the desire to get out ahead of the pack and be noticed and recognized, as a metaphor for the pressure that marketers put on people to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">live beyond their means in order to keep up with the Joneses</a>. It wasn't long before one person <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=l_v1h6Zoi-Q">mashed up<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the visuals of the ad with a different segment <em>from the very same sermon</em>, one that made the point far more directly  complete with explicit references to marketers selling automobiles.
</li><li> British outdoor clothing and supply store Go Outdoors uses "Let Me Go" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryBarlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryBarlow">Gary Barlow</a> over clips of a family having fun outside and doing various activities. If you know the song says about Gary's <em>stillborn daughter</em>, it becomes creepy to watch.
</li><li> Google phone ads are advertising how their built-in cameras don't have distracting flash effects... using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>'s most prominent song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlashGordon1980" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlashGordon1980">Flash Gordon</a></em>. Sadly, it is nearly impossible to hear any part of that song and think of flash as a <em>bad thing</em>.
</li><li> A NYC lottery ad used a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Oliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Oliver">"Food Glorious Food",</a> a song about starving kids wishing they had more food, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPorn">Food Porn</a> manner: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">when you're rich, you can have all the luxurious food you want</a>".
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxr-AHztTFU">This commercial for the Venetian Resort Las Vegas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> uses a remix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">"I Want It Now"</a> to promote their hotel as a place of indulgence, drawing particular focus to the "I want the world" lyric. It <em>works,</em> but remember the original context of the song is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> driving her father crazy as she <em>demands</em> every implausible thing in the world, and her refusal to accept <em>not</em> getting what she wants results in a karmic punishment (the short high note that ends the song in the remix replaces the original moment of the song where she <em>falls to her doom</em>).
</li><li> A 2020 Dunkin' commercial that tells customers how they're doing during the COVID-19 pandemic used the Powfu song "Death Bed". On one hand, the song is also known by its subtitle, "Coffee for Your Head", which suits a chain that sells coffee. On the other, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingthePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingthePoint">it's still called "Death Bed",</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">so it's not the best song to promote yourself while a virus is running amok and killing many people.</a>

This is all well and good until you hear the full version, where the lyrics stray into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> territory ("I stole ten thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds to see you / I robbed convenience stores 'cause I thought they'd make it easier / I lived off rats and toads, I starved for you / I fought off giant bears and I killed them too...").

<ul><li> <em>Lovefool</em> by The Cardigans, which shot to fame through its use in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BazLuhrmann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BazLuhrmann">Baz Luhrmann</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WilliamShakespearesRomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WilliamShakespearesRomeoAndJuliet">William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet</a></em>, sounds like a fairly standard love song ("Love me, love me, say that you love me") until you listen to the lyrics, in which the singer pleads for her beloved to just <em>pretend</em> he loves her back because she can't deal with rejection.
<ul><li> The same movie had #1 Crush, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Garbage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Garbage">Garbage</a>. Another song about obsession. Great choice for the movie.

If they actually played the lyrics, they might have noticed that the titular character comes to be forgotten and ignored by the populace, culminating in a grand return where he starts murdering them en masse. Say what you will about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>, but...
<ul><li> Canon has Tony Stark naming his superhero identity after his favorite song (which is only possible because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1">The film's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">novelization</a> even has Tony imitating Ozzy's "I AM IRON MAN!" after the newspapers give him the name. Earlier, he plays the song in his helmet while he's taking down the terrorists in Golmirra.
<ul><li> Playing the song during the terrorist fight is somewhat fitting. He went on a journey, saw destruction, and tried to stop it. When people didn't listen, he started killing. Though admittedly, Tony Stark does it with a lot more purpose and direction than the rage-filled slaughter the song's Iron Man indulged in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">For one final dose of irony</a>, Black Sabbath deliberately wrote the lyrics of the song to be about a villainous character because, in addition to it fitting with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HeavyMetal">usual motif</a>, they wanted to avoid getting sued for ripping off the Marvel comics character.

The song is about ghost cowboys damned to herd the Devil's cattle through the skies for eternity; in the movie, Johnny Blaze opts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustFlipOffCthulhu">Flip Off Cthulhu</a> and tell the Devil he's going to turn his curse against him and sabotage all his evil plans.

While the song did mention Godzilla by name, it was only to note that it was "pure motherfucking filler." The entire song is about American pop culture blinding people to the real problems in the world, used to advertise the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">overhyped movie ever.</a>
<ul><li> For that matter, a song about a couple's rendezvous at the Berlin Wall that acknowledges that the relationship may well not last has nothing to do with Godzilla, but The Wallflowers did a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>'s ""Heroes"" for the soundtrack anyway.

Hellboy's hands are both red, his right hand is significant for being over-sized to punch better, but Hellboy is not designing and directing anything with his hand, and he does not have a larger plan involving giving out cars and money.
<ul><li> The song itself can be considered an example of this trope, given that the original quote from John Milton's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost">Paradise Lost</a> refers to the vengeful right hand of God, and not Satan.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Look For A Star</em> from the movie <em>Circus Of Horrors</em>. Those who have never seen the movie named it one of the best love/inspirational songs of all-time.
</li><li> The closing scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Life1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Life1999">Life</a></em> was intended to be highly uplifting and spotlight Ray and Claude's friendship <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and freedom</span>. However, the song chosen was <em>What Would You Do</em> by City High, which is about a woman explaining her reasons for becoming a hooker. The song was obviously only chosen for the single chorus line "<em>But for me this is what I call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">life</a></em>."
</li><li> The driving-lesson montage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">Wreck-It Ralph</a></em> set to... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a>'s "Shut Up and Drive". That song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">isn't about motoring</a>...
</li><li> Also from Disney, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame">Frollo</a>'s showstopping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a> "Hellfire", which is about Frollo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">denying that his lust for Esmeralda is his fault</a> is backed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting">Ominous Latin Chanting</a> of... <em>the Act of Contrition.</em>

Apparently, nobody bothered to tell the director that that song was about <em>racism.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">Captain Marvel (2019)</a></em> has during the credits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CourtneyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CourtneyLove">Hole's</a> "Celebrity Skin". While at the surface, it fits Carol Danvers' awesomeness by being a rocking song sung by a woman, the lyrics are not as triumphant, being about the disillusion from fame (e.g. "Oh, look at my face\My name is Might-Have-Been\My name is Never Was\My name's forgotten" and "Wilted and faded\Somewhere in Hollywood"). On the other hand, another scene averts the trope, and in fact enhances the original irony: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt">No Doubt</a>'s "Just a Girl", where Gwen Stefani sarcastically sings about society's perception that she's weak and vulnerable, is played as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutobotsRockOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutobotsRockOut">Carol beats up an entire squad all by herself</a>.

<ul><li> Rare non-music example. The book "Seuss-isms for Success" uses quotes from Dr. Seuss books to motivate the reader. To encourage the reader to "be a good host," it uses this passage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThidwickTheBigHeartedMoose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThidwickTheBigHeartedMoose">Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose</a>:</em>

("No, I'll never be the same without you here/I'll live alone and hide myself behind my tears"). Beyond the ugly implication that an autistic person effectively "leaves" their family once they're diagnosed, the song's clearly about a <em>romantic relationship</em> that faded away when one listens to the verses as opposed to just the chorus...(and this is a novel aimed at conservative Christians!).

Read those lyrics again, people... it's not about missing someone who's died. It's about missing someone who's broken your heart and does not care about you anymore and wishing they'd reconsider.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel">Touched by an Angel</a></em> reversed the trope once. "No One Is Alone", from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods">Into the Woods</a></em>, is a rather straightforward song: life is tough, yet no one goes through it without <em>someone</em> beside them. It's not that surprising it would be used in this show, when angel Monica is faced with a crisis of faith. It <em>is</em> surprising that it's <em>Satan</em> singing it to her, trying to get her to join his side. (Notably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MandyPatinkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MandyPatinkin">Mandy Patinkin</a>, who has frequently performed in Sondheim's musicals, played Satan here.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a>' "Opportunities (Let's make lots of money)", a song about two shady losers co-conspiring a get-rich quick scheme (and implied imminent failure at said scheme), was used as the theme to "Beauty And The Geek" (where people actually <em>did</em> make lots of money), primarily because of the chorus "I've got the brains, you've got the looks/Let's make lots of money".
<ul><li> The same song was used in trailers for the 1987 TV movie/miniseries <em>Billionaire Boys Club</em>. Considering how the Boys' venture ends, it is safe to say that the song retains its original meaning.
</li><li> "Shopping" is a safe bet for use in any scene that features shopping, but it's actually about corruption. ("We check it with the City, then change the laws... I heard it in the House of Commons, everything's for sale.")
</li></ul></li><li> Despite being a song about a troubled relationship, with a bridge starting with "why don't we break up / there's nothing left to say", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobbieWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobbieWilliams">Robbie Williams</a>' "Sexed Up" has been frequently used to score a love montage on Italian reality TV.
<ul><li> It was also used in Brazilian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telenovela" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telenovela">telenovela</a> <em>Mulheres Apaixonadas</em> ("Women in Love") as the theme for the characters Diogo and Marina, who live a troubled marriage plagued by jealousy and infidelity (specifically, Diogo cheating on Marina with her cousin Luciana). While the song technically fits their storyline, as they ultimately separate, many a viewer didn't realize this, mistaking "Sexed Up" for a more standard love ballad without looking at the translation of the lyrics. So the song ended up appearing on a lot of wedding playlists at the time.
</li><li> Williams got hit with this again with the usage of "Advertising Space" as the love theme for the characters Duda and Leona in <em>Cobras e Lagartos</em> ("Snakes and Lizards"). The song in question is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GriefSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GriefSong">Grief Song</a> dedicated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>, describing the downfall of Presley's career and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">condemning the usage of his image as a marketing strategy after his death</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to the language barrier, this is pretty common in Brazilian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telenovela" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telenovela">telenovelas</a>. Up there with "Sexed Up" as one of the more notable examples is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a>'s "Because of You" being used as a general love theme in <em>Belíssima</em> — when the song in question is about the divorce of Kelly's parents, and how it affected her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS">PBS</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HistoryDetectives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HistoryDetectives">History Detectives</a></em> uses a part of the song "Watching The Detectives" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a> as their theme song. The song appears to be about a young woman's very violent death, in great contrast with the usually more family-friendly content of the show.
</li><li> A commercial for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasNextTopModel">America's Next Top Model</a></em> once used "High School Never Ends", by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup">Bowling for Soup</a>. The song itself is about a teenager entering high school, seeing how pretentious and superficial people are, and waiting it out for four years... then discovering that the rest of life is the same way. First verse: "Four years, you think for sure/that's all you've got to endure/all the total dicks, all the stuck-up chicks/so superficial, so immature/But then when you graduate/you take a look around and you say 'Hey, wait!/This is the same as where I just came from,/I though it was over, aww, that's just great.'"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> had the Season 8 winner Kris Allen perform <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe">Let It Be</a></em> on stage accompanied by a montage of Haiti relief efforts. Not to mention his fellow <em>Idol</em> alumni Jennifer Hudson, who sang that same song for the "Hope For Haiti" telethon. Or the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_It_Be_%28Ferry_Aid_song%29">"Ferry Aid" version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> himself. Apparently nobody realized that the song is about <em>not</em> intervening in things that one has no business meddling in.
</li><li> David Copperfield is famous for having "Mercy Street" by Peter Gabriel as his theme song. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=749">What he doesn't know, however, is that the song is about<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">child molestation, insanity, and suicide</a></em>.
</li><li> An early episode of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a></em> had Brandon dating a teen mother with a baby named Joey. They constantly played Concrete Blonde's hit single "Joey" during the episode. The song is about a woman in a co-dependent relationship deciding to stay with her alcoholic lover.
</li><li> Germany's <em>Deutschland sucht den Superstar</em> (you could say <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">German Idol</a></em>, it's the same branch) uses Melanie C's "Next Best Superstar" to celebrate their winner. <em>"Crack a smile in denial; throw your morals on the fire"</em>.
<ul><li> They also covered "The Edge Of Glory" and used it as their theme. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaGa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaGa">Lady Ga Ga</a> wrote that song about the death of her grandfather.
</li></ul></li><li> Elimination show and beauty contest <em>The Swan</em>, which took ordinary-looking women and gave them plastic surgery to bring them closer to mainstream notions of conventional beauty, made use of Groove Armada's "If Everybody Looked the Same", oblivious to the meaning of the song's refrain "If everybody looked the same, we'd get tired of looking at each other".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasFunniestHomeVideos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasFunniestHomeVideos">America's Funniest Home Videos</a></em> music montages occasionally fall into this trap; one of the worst was the choruses (<em>only</em> the choruses) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Albums/YA/YA.html">"Young Americans"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> being used to underscore cute toddler clips.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC">BBC</a> used a reworking of Lou Reed's <em>Perfect Day</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Transformer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Transformer">Transformer</a></em> as an advert to demonstrate its commitment to bringing pleasure through music, each line of the song voiced by performers as diverse as rap singers and opera divas, in order to demonstrate the diversity of the Beeb's commitment to supporting and promoting musical talent. The subtext was that the BBC is a jolly nice organisation and you too can have a wholesome and indeed a perfect day with clean-living BBC radio and television. Yet wasn't Lou Reed's original a deceptively stealth little number, only superficially about two lovers enjoying a perfect day together... but deeper down it's about his destructive relationship with the love of his life  heroin  and what it can do to screw you up long-term?
<ul><li> What makes this even stranger is that the reason the song had re-entered public consciousness at that time was its use in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Trainspotting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Trainspotting">Trainspotting</a></em>, where its druggy connotations were made very obvious indeed.
</li></ul></li><li> For a few seasons, the long-running BBC technology series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TomorrowsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TomorrowsWorld">Tomorrow's World</a></em> used an instrumental portion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a>'s "In Pursuit of Happiness" as its theme tune. Anybody who heard the lyrics would realise the song is quite the opposite of the show's upbeat outlook on progress  the edit used on the show looped back to the start just in time to avoid the vocal coming in with "Hey, don't be surprised if millions die in plague and murder".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> theme song <em>Suicide is Painless</em> is quite upbeat, while the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlnB34ZDo9g">original version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with lyrics from film is very sombre.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> episode "Family" ends with a scene of Willow and Tara dancing to the song "I Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You" by Melanie Doane. The effect of this otherwise touching scene is somewhat marred if you know that the acompanying music is actually a love letter to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a television</span>.
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em>'s Vietnam Special, the dreaded "if-your-vehicle-breaks-down-you-have-to-ride-this" vehicle was a motorbike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">decorated with a Stars and Stripes motif</a>, playing what the producers felt was culturally insensitive music. The music in question was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> song <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornInTheUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornInTheUSA">Born In The USA</a></em>, a song that specifically condemns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> and isn't patriotic in the least. Later releases of the episode picked up on this, and replaced the music in post with the Star Spangled Banner.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DanFogelberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DanFogelberg">Dan Fogelberg</a>'s 1978 single <em>The Power of Gold</em> was broadcast by ABC as part of its pre-Olympics show for the 1980 Lake Placid Winter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a>. The actual lyrics of the song are a cautionary tale about making one's life about material gain; thus, gold having the alluring <em>power</em> to destroy one's life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s family game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGenerationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGenerationGame">The Generation Game</a></em> used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer">Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</a>'s <em>Karn Evil 9</em> (specifically, "First Impression Part Two") for the title music and music stings. One wonders if the Beeb knew about the car-bomb lyrics or the "seven virgins and a mule" bit. (The song was apparently chosen by host Jim Davidson, a big prog rock fan, which suggests he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a>.)
</li><li> The ZDF documentary <em>Deutschland-Saga</em> (in the <em>Terra X</em> slot) used <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DiePrinzen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DiePrinzen">Die Prinzen</a>'s "Deutschland" as its theme. The song is a tongue-in-cheek satire; the chorus is harmless enough, but they also used the repeated "Deutsch! Deutsch!" shouts, which irritated some viewers.
</li><li> Subverted to brilliant effect in the final scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em> Season 2, set to "Every Breath You Take" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> song with a gentle sound and romantic-sounding lyrics, but intended by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting">the songwriter</a> to depict an abusive, controlling, and angry figure. So just when you've spent a few minutes thinking it's the wrong choice for a school dance scene filled with romantic moments, the very end of the scene reveals that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, who definitely fits the description of "abusive, controlling, and angry figure", is watching the whole thing, turning the song back into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> it's supposed to be.
</li><li> The Police also had a straightforward case a few years later, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoronavirusDisease2019Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoronavirusDisease2019Pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a> made "Don't Stand So Close to Me" seem like a instruction manual given the containment required social distancing, and Sting even did a home recording for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShowStarringJimmyFallon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShowStarringJimmyFallon">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a></em>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWTF3j9CGoU">As highlighted by<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webvideo/ADoseOfBuckley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webvideo/ADoseOfBuckley">A Dose of Buckley</a>, this means ignoring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance">Teacher/Student Romance</a> that is the theme of the song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaRoux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaRoux">La Roux</a>'s "Bulletproof", a song in which Elly Jackson sings about putting an ex-boyfriend firmly behind her, was used by the Fox Business Channel for a back-to-school segment promoting bulletproof backpacks in response to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxesAtSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxesAtSchool">school shootings</a>. Jackson herself was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45272554">not amused<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, calling their use of it "abhorrent".
</li><li> During MSNBC's coverage of the American missile strikes on Syria on April 7, 2017, while showing footage of the missiles being launched, reporter Brian Williams commented on how "beautiful" they looked. He then said "I am tempted to quote the great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonardCohen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonardCohen">Leonard Cohen</a>: 'I am guided by the beauty of our weapons.'" Apparently he never noticed that the song he was quoting, "First We Take Manhattan", is written from the perspective of a fanatical terrorist.
</li><li> Another example from Brazilian TV. In the year 1995, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telenovela" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telenovela">telenovela</a> <em>Quatro por Quatro</em> was being broadcast, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4qU6t1ZH24">Gillette and 20 Fingers came to Brazil to perform their song "Short Dick Man"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which was featured on the novela's soundtrack. The problem? They performed it on <em>Xuxa Hits</em>, a live TV show for <em>children</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">without changing the lyrics</a>. This results in a rather crass song, in which the singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenyWeenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenyWeenie">relentlessly mocks a guy for having a small penis</a>, being performed in front of a crowd of bouncing children, while host Xuxa Meneghel sways along in the background, unbothered.
<ul><li> Something similar happened in 1987, when the band Os Cascavelletes appeared on the live show <em>Clube da Criança</em> to perform a song called... "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_YIgY7yaq4">Eu Quis Comer Você<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" ("I Wanted to Fuck You"). When they talk about the song to host Angélica afterwards, she responds with a nonchalant "Wow, cool!" As the song is in Portuguese, it's arguably even worse than the "Short Dick Man" example, which could at least be justified by the language barrier.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Music </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Despite the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a>'s "Ring of Fire" is actually an upbeat love song, the song's title and somewhat ambiguous chorus leads some people to believe that it is about demonic destruction, not about passionate love, and will use it in music videos with montages of people fighting in flames or being burnt alive.
</li><li> In a similar vein, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a>'s downright creepy "Every Breath You Take" has also appeared in love scenes and has been used in weddings. The Police call it an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong">Anti-Love Song</a>. It's about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>.
<ul><li> An early advertisement for the Singapore Civil Defense has used "Every Breath You Take" as a background song, sampling the chorus as an example of how well the Civil Defense (kinda of like the country-wide fire department) takes good care of you. It just ended up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Paranoia Fuel</a>.
</li><li> Not to mention that the stalker song is sampled for use in Puff Daddy's tribute to Biggie. You have to wonder if P. Diddy ever actually listened to the song (though considering that Sting has participated in performances of the tribute, apparently he's decided to just roll with it). They did change enough lyrics that someone who never heard the original wouldn't know. (It's now "missing you" instead of "watching you".)
</li><li> It's gotten to the point where some people have inverted it, thinking that they are the first to bring up the stalker angle, thinking it's unintentional on The Police's part.
</li></ul></li><li> Hinder's "Lips of an Angel" sometimes gets used at weddings and in other romantic contexts. It's a song about cheating and not being able to move on from past relationships. Apparently people only focus on lines like "coming from the lips of an angel, hearing my name it makes me weak", while ignoring ones like "You make it hard to be faithful, with the lips of an angel" in <strong>the same chorus.</strong> On the other hand, there's no shortage of stories throughout history that treat adultery as romantic, such as the tale of Lancelot and Guinevere (at least before it ended in tragedy), so maybe that's how some folks meant to interpret it.
</li><li> Apparently, some people think "Bed of Roses" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi">Bon Jovi</a> would be appropriate for their wedding.
</li><li> The same is true for "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a>, often being played at weddings and graduations, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakUpSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakUpSong">Break Up Song</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">The clue's in the name</a>, which, to be fair, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">does not appear in the lyrics</a> and is sometimes not used when it's played. While not a wedding song, it's sort of appropriate for graduations at least.
</li><li> Vast numbers of newlyweds dance to "I Will Always Love You" (mainly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston">Whitney Houston</a> version) at their wedding, without realizing that it's a song about breaking up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton">Dolly Parton</a> wrote it when she and Porter Wagoner dissolved their professional relationship and she was very broken up about it because Wagoner was her mentor, a father figure, and her closest friend. Still, it's a song about losing someone you love and still holding onto that love.
</li><li> "Sweetest Thing" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a>. The "love's the sweetest thing" parts and even the "blue-eyed boy and this brown-eyed girl" part are rather offset by the "I'm losing you" and the song's generally being about how the singer always screws everything up.
<ul><li> The band has been often disgusted when fans tell them that they played "One" at their weddings, prompting Bono to respond:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Bono:</strong> ARE YOU MAD!? It's about splitting up!
</div></li><li> "Better Man" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Pearl Jam</a>. What a great romantic wedding song... about a woman unable to bring herself to end an abusive relationship. "She lies and says she's in love with him..."
</li><li> Also inappropriate for weddings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s "All My Love". The somber mood should make clear that it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GriefSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GriefSong">Grief Song</a>, which Robert Plant actually wrote for his late <em>son</em>.
</li><li> "Don't Leave Home" by Dido is supposed to be about addiction, and even without that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, lines like "You won't need other friends anymore" and "I arrived when you were weak / I'll make you weaker like a child" ought to be a tip-off. Dido has said that people have told her they played it at their weddings and that she finds this fact a little disturbing.
<ul><li> On another note, "White Flag." Typically used by fandom to describe their support for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing">OTP</a> ("I will go down with this ship!"), it's a love song all right... regarding unrequited love. "White Flag" is actually about someone still in love with their ex and wanting to stay together with them, though it's clear the relationship is already over.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>' song "Lily (My One and Only)" at first sounds like a beautiful love song. Then, when you listen to the lyrics properly, it sounds like the horrible tale of a stalker. Finally, if you look into it, it turns out it's a song of dedication, written by Billy Corgan, to his <em>cat</em>.
</li><li> Chumbawamba's "Tubthumping" has been used as theme music for hopeful, perky young protagonists, in spite of the fact that the song itself is about getting drunk and brawling in bars with your better days long gone by. (It was written as an ambiguous anthem for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem">Old Labour</a>" after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a>'s "New Labour" had sucked the spirit out of the British Left in the-mid 90s; Chumbawamba are left-wing anarchists. In short, the person "pissing the night away" brawling in bars with better days behind them is British Socialism and the British labour movement).
</li><li> German group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WirSindHelden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WirSindHelden">Wir sind Helden</a>'s second single, "Müssen nur wollen", was intended as a parody/deconstruction of the "you can do it!" style of self-help media. According to Judith Holofernes, a lot of people took the song to be an upbeat "you can do it!" in its own right.
</li><li> German group Die Prinzen's 1993 song "Alles nur geklaut", which mocks, among other things, cover versions of hit songs, has been covered by female singer Sha... with altered lyrics.
<ul><li> Die Prinzen's song "Deutschland" is a very subtle, until the end, parody of hyper-nationalism. It's commonly used as a German pride song by less than perceptive people.
<ul><li> The same is true in the US with Bruce Springsteen's "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornInTheUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BornInTheUSA">Born In The USA</a>", which has frequently been used by Republican politicians as a symbol of American national pride (especially during the 1984 presidential race by Ronald Reagan), when it's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> focusing on the mistreatment of Vietnam veterans.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> German band Geier Sturzflug's 1980s hits "Bruttosozialprodukt" (a heavily ironic song about workaholics) and "Die pure Lust am Leben" (a genuinely upbeat song, but with an ironic attitude referencing social criticism, about the singer not losing his lust for life despite all the things thrown at him) have now been reduced to Carnival and party fun songs, both due to people not paying attention to the lyrics and because the lyrics (at least of the latter song) have lost their zeitgeist-specific context.
</li><li> The Scots folk-song "The Bonnie Banks O' Loch Lomond", aka "You Take the High Road", has been almost universally misrepresented, even in Scotland, as a cheerful walking song, and as such has been used as upbeat background music and even as the title of a soap opera. In fact it's about two prisoners, one of whom is to be released and the other executed at the same hour. The "low road" referred to is the road that the dead go on  the speaker will get home faster than his friend because he'll be travelling as a ghost, but he'll never meet his true love again in this life. "Auld Lang Syne" is likewise a slow, sad song about ageing, nostalgia, loss, and regret, although it gets sung as a happy bouncy bit of festive trivia. "Auld Lang Syne" sung properly will make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson">Greg</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer">Lake</a>'s "I Believe In Father Christmas" is faithfully trotted out by radio stations each December for their "all-Christmas-music" programming, despite the fact that the song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChristmasSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChristmasSong">mocks the holiday rather bitterly</a>, and is outright stated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to be about growing out of the childhood illusion of Christmas.
<ul><li> It goes the other way too, being lampshaded quite frequently by DJs who think they're being more subversive by playing it than they actually are.
</li></ul></li><li> "Have Yourselves a Merry Little Christmas," as originally written and as performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland">Judy Garland</a> in <em>Meet Me in St. Louis</em>, was a melancholy "buck-up" song about having hope for the future in light of the lousy present. Understandably for 1944, it struck a chord with soldiers serving overseas. Today, arguably more people are familiar with Frank Sinatra's more upbeat arrangement, after he asked the songwriter to "jolly it up."
</li><li> The sheer number of people who think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a>' song "Closer" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDownwardSpiral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDownwardSpiral">The Downward Spiral</a></em> (aka the 'Fuck you like an animal' song) is a great song to have sex to is astounding. Let's not beat around the bush and just make one thing clear: if having sex because it's the only thing that takes you away from the psychological hell you've found yourself trapped in is your thing, then go for it. If not, don't. Honestly, the line "Help me get away from myself" ought to have keyed you in.
</li><li> Celldweller's "Frozen" is similarly described as a great song to have sex to, and definitely is somehow about sex, but lyrically it seems to be more about being lost in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">A Date with Rosie Palms</a> whilst thinking of an ex and being unable to move on. "It's better to be broken than to break".
</li><li> As described in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantDuet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantDuet">Distant Duet</a>, the song "Somewhere Out There" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail">An American Tail</a></em> is about two characters separated by thousand of miles that wish to reunite some day. Except the movie version was sung by two siblings. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Oddly, this does not deter people from using it as a love song.</a>
</li><li> It would be difficult to describe <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awy4biqD_dA">"White Wedding"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol">Billy Idol</a> as having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">Lyrical Dissonance</a>, given the dark melody is very fitting for a song about a man resenting his younger sister's fiancé, while the bride starts having second thoughts but is forced to accept her fate  and if the message wasn't clear enough, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">Shotgun</a>" is said a few times. And yet, it has been played at many many weddings since its 1982 release.
</li><li> Sara Bareilles' "Love Song" is often used in ads for romantic comedies. The story behind it is that the record company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">wanted her to write a love song</a> and she refused. They continued, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt">she wrote a song to tell them off.</a> The most ironic part is that the line "Not gonna write you a love song" is what's usually featured in the ad.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>'s "Radio Ga Ga", a song about how terrible it is that radio is being reduced to meaningless background noise, can most often be heard on an oldies station providing meaningless background noise.
<ul><li> The sheer irony of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> complaining about how video clips are more important than the music was not lost on the band: there's a reason why the clip to "Radio Ga Ga" features a montage of scenes from their other clips.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a> adopted her stage name from the song. Though, she likely saw the irony in doing so.
</li></ul></li><li> The Supernaturals' <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEdyCQNuqls">"Smile"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> features a bouncy melody, goes "Smile! Smile! Smile! Smile!", and is very often taken as an upbeat, happy song. Despite the fact that anyone paying attention to... well, almost <em>any</em> lyrics beyond that would realise that it's a much darker and more downbeat song than that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RatedRRihannaAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RatedRRihannaAlbum">"Te Amo"</a> is celebrated as a song of lesbian love ("Te amo, te amo [I love you], she says to me...")  except that in the song Rihanna rejects the other girl because she doesn't feel the same way (whether it's towards the other girl specifically or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompatibleOrientation">women in general</a> is not made clear).
</li><li> In 2001, some bright spark at Air France decided that Madonna's cover of "American Pie" would make wonderful inflight entertainment. "American Pie" is about the deaths of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper in a plane crash. Also, this was just a year after one of Air France's Concordes had crashed on takeoff from Paris Charles de Gaulle International Airport.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eve6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eve6">Eve 6</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here%27s_to_the_Night_%28song%29">"Here's to the Night"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a song about a one-night stand, was apparently the only slow song that was popular in 2000, and therefore very popular to play on prom night. Might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman">Randy Newman</a>'s "I Love LA" tends to be played whenever the music director of a film / TV show set in Los Angeles needs a soundtrack for an "isn't it great to be in LA?" scene (including the baseball montage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedGun">The Naked Gun</a></em>, as tongue-in-cheek as it is). A closer listen to the lyrics would reveal that the song is, if not outright cynical, then at least ambivalent about exactly how great a place Los Angeles (and the narrator of the song, who is at one point heard to be chortling over the suffering of a homeless person) is.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidzBop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidzBop">Kidz Bop</a> albums (probably all of them) give shades of this when you hear children cheerfully singing gems like "Oops!... I Did It Again" (about toying with another's emotions) and "Burn" (about a devastating breakup), amongst others. Ostensibly, this is a good alternative to letting your kid listen to the songs as they're originally recorded by artists with dubious wholesomeness... but if they're covering unwholesome songs to begin with, what's the point? A few lyrical tweaks don't make most of them kid-friendly. Probably the best example was their cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a>'s "Born This Way," which is about acceptance, but they actually removed all the parts that have to do with accepting gay or bisexual people. It's been referred to as "Born This Way: Homophobic Version."
</li><li> People, as much as you may think it's appropriate, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">My Favorite Things</a>" is not a Christmas song. It has at most two lyrics which bring wintertime to mind, and one of those lyrics is supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">about groceries</a>. Nevertheless, popular culture has more or less superglued the song to the Christmas season.
</li><li> The rather ubiquitous use of Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the Heart" at weddings, or even as a general love song. It's a love song, alright... <strong>for vampires</strong>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Song author Jim Steinman:</strong> I actually wrote that to be a vampire love song. Its original title was "Vampires In Love" because I was working on a musical of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a></em>, the other great vampire story. If anyone listens to the lyrics, they're really like vampire lines. It's all about the darkness, the power of darkness, and love's place in the dark.
</div></li><li> The use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a>'s <em>Detroit Rock City</em> at Red Wings games. A cover version that omitted the second and fourth verses (the second mentioning drinking and smoking, the fourth detailing the thoughts of the narrator just before he's in a fatal highway crash) was used for the team's 1997 playoff run. Given that a couple of their players nearly died in a car crash just days after their victory (thanks to their limo driver, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">who was on a suspended license due to drunk driving and may or may not have been high at the time</a>), the song's continued use (even if it's just the opening these days) can seem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">downright grisly if you think about it too much.</a> Even with some verses removed, the chorus is a double entendre for the crash.

</div></li><li> "You Are My Sunshine" by Jimmie Davis is usually used as an uplifting, upbeat song about how loving someone and how they make you happy. The song itself is about how the love of the singer's life has left him, and how miserable he is, and how she'll never be happy without him.
<ul><li> Used correctly in Bright Eyes's depressing and angry song The Calendar Hung It Itself.
</li></ul></li><li> Jason Derulo's sampled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImogenHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImogenHeap">Imogen Heap</a> for his song "Whatcha Say", wherein he sings along with the chorus about his apology. The problem is, in "Hide and Seek", the singer was clearly sarcastic, about how the person in question <em>didn't</em> mean well. So, in this context, it's Derulo singing about just how unfaithful and spiteful he is ("I don't want you to leave me\Though you caught me cheatin'"). Oops.
<ul><li> Derulo missed the point of the song he's sampling again in "Don't Wanna Go Home", where he samples the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryBelafonte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryBelafonte">Harry Belafonte</a> song "Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)", about a guy who's working so hard he can't wait to go home... to talk about a guy who's partying so hard he doesn't wanna go home.
</li></ul></li><li> "Flappie", an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChristmasSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChristmasSong">Anti-Christmas Song</a> by Dutch comedian Youp Van't Hek, is one of the most played songs on Dutch radio in the holiday period.
</li><li> The members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> were, depending on whom and when you asked, amused or angry that they'd see couples holding hands to "The One I Love" at concerts, which doesn't fit with the lyrics ("<em>This one goes out to the one I love/This one goes out to the one I left behind/A simple prop to occupy my time</em>...)
<ul><li> In the same vein, "Losing My Religion" is often misinterpreted or taken literally, even though Stipe has gone on record saying it's supposed to be about unrequited love.
</li><li> And another popular choice for weddings... "Everybody Hurts".
</li></ul></li><li> Talk to any woman who was in high school or junior high in 2005, "My Humps" by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackEyedPeas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackEyedPeas">Black Eyed Peas</a> was their "song". Given that the song makes fun of women who act like sluts and brag about their fancy clothes to attract men's attention...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MGMT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MGMT">MGMT</a>'s "Time To Pretend" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OracularSpectacular" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OracularSpectacular">Oracular Spectacular</a></em> is quite clearly a sarcastic slamming of the "sex drugs and rock and roll" lifestyle. Most people think it's a <em>celebration</em> of said lifestyle. Nevermind the lines about choking on your vomit, missing a simple and ordinary lifestyle, and the increasingly sad tone of the song as it progresses.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PussyCatDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PussyCatDolls">Pussy Cat Dolls</a> song "Don't Cha" is often thought to promote cheating on your girlfriend with a more attractive woman ("Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?") It is actually about resisting the urge to do so for the sake of protecting the more valuable relationship.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>'s "Only the Good Die Young" is quite popular among grieving teenagers who post it on Facebook in tribute of a friend that's recently died. What they likely miss is that that the song isn't at all about young people dying, but instead about a rebel who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatholicSchoolGirlsRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatholicSchoolGirlsRule">wants to deflower a Catholic girl</a>.
</li><li> "Cold Water Music" by AIM is known to be a very happy, calming, chill instrumental song... even though at about 3 minutes and 15 seconds in, you can hear sounds of gunfire and people screaming in the background.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "Money" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a></em> is often used to promote "do crazy stuff on the air for money" type radio contests. It's about how money and greed makes you do stupid things.
<ul><li> On the subject of Pink Floyd, "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em> is seen as a cheerful, joking protest of school rules, when it's really a protest against conformity and verbally abusive teachers. (At the 12/12/12 concert for Sandy relief, Roger Waters got in on the act by using cheerful teenaged girls to sing the second verse. It was... bizarre.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>'s "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of3YyS7Rvfo">Just the Way You Are<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" is traditionally played at weddings, to the point that it's becoming a cliché. This ignores its ridiculous assumptions that a) it's wrong to change with time, b) and if you are changing, it must be for your mate. Not to mention that, while listing the things that the hypothetical woman "shouldn't" change, the song lists a number of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">faults.</a> In fact, this suddenly becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> when one stops to consider Joel's own history with women, which he lampshaded at one performance of this song at Gillette Stadium.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11n0x');"><sup>More </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11n0x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11n0x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To elaborate: he made a "so-so" gesture with one hand while singing (and playing) the line: "I said I love you/That's forever."</span>
<ul><li> The song is reassuring a partner that they don't <em>have</em> to change to keep the singer's interest — they have his interest just as they are now. In other words, it's about <em>not</em> changing "just for your mate," but being yourself. It doesn't really mention natural changes over time at all, it's about <em>artificial</em> changes adopted out of fear (and why they're not necessary). The only ironic thing about using it in weddings is the implication that the relationship has been going on for some time, while weddings are "traditionally" a relationship's beginning... but these days, that's less of a problem.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast">Outkast</a>'s "Hey Ya" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">a somber song about falling out of love masquerading as an upbeat pop number.</a> Well aware of this trope, in the middle of the chorus, Andre 3000 sarcastically quips, "Y'all don't want to hear me, y'all just wanna dance."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nena">Nena</a>'s "99 Luftballons" (not to be confused with the Red Balloons song) is a perky, upbeat-sounding pop song that frequently gets used in dance halls, proms and other upbeat social events. The song itself is an anti-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> song about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANuclearError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANuclearError">a swarm of children's balloons triggering a nuclear war</a>. Part of what helps this is that the song was originally released in German.
</li><li> One gets the feeling that the music video director missed the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys">The Oak Ridge Boys</a>' "No Matter How High". The line "baby, I must confess" makes it pretty clear that the song is being sung to the narrator's wife. But the video has all four of the Oaks reuniting with their <em>mothers</em>. (To be fair, the "baby" line is the only part of the song that anchors it to husband-wife love; the rest is rather open-ended. One wonders why they didn't just take that word out.)
</li><li> The song "East Bound and Down" by Jerry Reed, and covered by him and many other bands like The Road Hammers, was the theme song for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmokeyAndTheBandit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmokeyAndTheBandit">Smokey and the Bandit</a></em>. Its melody and music fits well to be used as a travel montage song for music videos or movies, since its melody evokes images of speeding freight trains or semi trucks on interstate highways, although the lyrics themselves are about a trucker who is bootlegging Coors liquor from Texas to Georgia and trying to avoid being caught by the police. Depending on what you set it to, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1qjh3tPRFU">like was done by this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the irony becomes very transparent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomPetty">"American Girl"</a>, which she even covered, as intro music, is appropriate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGuessWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGuessWho">"American Woman"</a>, not so much (after all, the very first line is "American woman, stay away from me!").
</li><li> "Closing Time" by Semisonic is not about a bar closing up for the night. It was written in anticipation of front man Dan Wilson's impending fatherhood.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1x5z3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1x5z3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1x5z3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though he's also said he was just trying to come up with a good song to use for the end of their live performances, and only realized he was subconsciously writing about birth partway through.</span> Lyric in point: "This room won't be open <em>'til your brothers or your sisters come.</em>"
</li><li> One compilation album of love songs included "Rhinestone Cowboy"  which is about as far from a love song as it's possible to get, short of singing of the glory of nuclear war.
</li><li> Some might ring in the New Year with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a>'s "Happy New Year". While the song has an Auld Lang Syne feel, the song is actually about things that are wrong in the world and how at the end of the celebration, nothing will have changed.

Some people seemed oblivious to the fact that in the song, the singer takes her boyfriend there as a reward for good sex.
</li><li> A while back, someone on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> (probably a young kid), made what was supposed to be a sweet video tribute to a deceased pet/horse... except the person used Minnie Riperton's "Loving You", which is a sweet-sounding, bird-song-filled... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">Intercourse with You</a> song. (This may be the same kid mentioned in the <em>Theater</em> examples below who set her horse photos and such to <em>Sweeney Todd</em> songs.) However, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> if you remember that it was actually intended to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalLoveSong">Parental Love Song</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MayaRudolph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MayaRudolph">the singer's daughter</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s "Born in the USA" is often mistaken for and used as a patriotic anthem due to its catchy hook and chorus. However, the lyrics are describing a Baby Boomer man whose life is disintegrating due to Vietnam War PTSD and industrial decay and job-loss in the Rust Belt. He's protesting that this shouldn't be happening in America, to Americans.
</li><li> A staple of British Halloween compilation albums is the Specials' "Ghost Town". They evidently don't look past the title of the song and look at the lyrics  it's about urban decay, deindustrialisation, unemployment, and violence in inner cities. (That being said, the reason it's stuck around in this usage for <em>so long</em> is because it is a <em>very</em> ghostly-sounding song. As in, an instrumental version could be used as Haunted House music without any other changes.)
</li><li> "Gone Country" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson">Alan Jackson</a> was meant to be a cynical look at how the genre of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> has become inundated with posers who have no traditional upbringing whatsoever (no doubt espousing a feeling from writer Bob McDill, who retired not long after writing the song). However, it's often appropriated as a celebration of diversity and mainstreaming of the genre (even by Jackson himself!), and is a popular "first song" for stations that switch over to the country format from another genre.
</li><li> Paul Hardcastle's "Nineteen" got this when Manchester United supporters got it back on the UK charts in honor of their record 19th league title. This means ignoring the fact that the song is about the Vietnam War.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoyzIIMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoyzIIMen">Boyz II Men</a> wrote two sentimental-sounding ballads that were a staple of high school dances in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>: "End of the Road" and "On Bended Knee". Both songs, which teen couples would slow-dance to, are <em>breakup</em> songs. In "On Bended Knee", the singer is begging his ex to take him back. Meanwhile, "End of the Road" is about the singer's unhealthy obsession with his ex and his inability to let go despite the relationship being over.

</li><li> Pretty much any film, documentary, TV programme, or anything else that uses <em>Big in Japan</em> by Alphaville to set the mood for a Japanese setting. That song is about a man wondering whether or not he should leave his empty life as a male prostitute in Japan, which is a rather easy one as he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed">big in Japan</a>.

Was it supposed to be a consolation for the losers?
</li><li> The Whitlams' "Love This City" was used extensively in Australia's broadcast of the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000. The song is about a man who commits suicide by jumping off the Harbour Bridge. Worse, the news that Sydney is hosting the Games is implied to be what pushed him over the edge, so to speak.
</li><li> Astronaut Chris Hadfield released a video of himself performing the title track of Bowie's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity">Space Oddity</a></em> in the International Space Station.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> verses were changed/removed, but still, it's sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Tempting Fate</a> to sing that song when you're actually in space.

Very touching song, until you realize it's an anti-slavery song about a slave (or slaves) being "sold down the river" to work in the Louisiana sugar cane plantations.
</li><li> Olympic figure skater Yuzuru Hanyu has stated that his number one motivational song is <em>Kaze</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em>. Both the song and the lyrics are uplifting, so the irony isn't in the lyrics, but rather, the context the song was used in the anime. In the context of <em>Digimon Tamers</em>, the song was meant to give viewers a false sense of hope. The kids, being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> fans, are expecting the Digital World to be a brightly colored, fun wonderland like it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">in the prior seasons</a>, hence the uplifting music when they depart.

<ul><li> In yet another case of a politician completely missing the subtext of a song, presidential candidate John McCain made an appearance at a primarily Latino high school alongside reggaeton rapper Daddy Yankee, and made reference to the latter's song "Gasolina".

Songwriter Chrissie Hynde eventually allowed its use on the condition that her royalty checks be directed to PETA (which Limbaugh was fine with). However, Rush has explained before that he doesn't care about the lyrics or politics of the band, he just likes the song and the bassline makes a good intro to the show.
</li><li> Special mention should go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>: in 1984, his "Born in the USA", a song about a disaffected Vietnam veteran, nearly got picked up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s campaign until Springsteen turned him down.
<ul><li> Of course, that's after John (Cougar) Melloncamp refused to allow Reagan to use his song "Pink Houses", which has a "patriotic" chorus, but similar disillusionment in its verses.
</li><li> The irony continued in 1992, when the <em>Democratic</em> National Convention played "Born in the U.S.A." as a patriotic anthem, following Bill Clinton's speech.

</li></ul></li><li> Sean Hannity uses an out-of-context clip to make Martina McBride's "Independence Day" sound like it's about terrorism but, in fairness to Mr. Hannity, those lines make a lot more sense that way than as part of a song about spousal abuse.
<ul><li> "Independence Day" is frequently misused as a simple patriotic anthem, ignoring the verses (which describe an abusive relationship ending in suicide from the point of view of a young child).
</li></ul></li><li> The song "Part of the Union" by the Strawbs was, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> (and quite blatantly in the original 1970s British context), a right-wing satire on trade unions and unionised workers as lazy, selfish, and too influential over the Labour Party government. This has not prevented actual trade unionists in various parts of the world from using the song as an actual recruiting tool and anthem.
</li><li> When the Republicans used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart">Heart</a>'s "Barracuda" as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin">Sarah Palin</a>'s theme song, Nancy Wilson responded that the song "was written in the late 70s as a scathing rant against the soulless, corporate nature of the music business, particularly for women..." Specifically, about some record execs spreading a rumor that Nancy and her sister were "involved".
<ul><li> Granted, the reason Palin used that song was because her nickname in high school was "Saracuda", and that was something that her supporters were aware of at the time. Might bring up some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>, but at least they weren't using the song because of some perceived lyrical meaning.
</li></ul></li><li> In 2009, the British National Party used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManicStreetPreachers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManicStreetPreachers">Manic Street Preachers</a>' "If You Tolerate This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren">Your Children Will Be Next</a>" on their website, without permission. The song contains the lines "If I can shoot rabbits, then I can shoot fascists". The song was removed when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a> threatened legal action.
<ul><li> The song has been used by various political movements from all sorts of political leanings, from bleeding heart liberals to fascists, since children-based rhetorics seem to appeal to everyone, apart from those apathetic to politics. Young men sent to the frontline by warlike conservatives? If you tolerate this, your children will be next. Liberals propagating that homosexuals and heathens are to be tolerated? If you tolerate this, your children will be next.
</li></ul></li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cabaret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cabaret">Tomorrow Belongs to Me</a>" has been recorded by more than one White Nationalist band. At least they're honest.
</li><li> Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, sang <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Imagine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Imagine">Imagine</a></em> with a little Asian girl for a photo op during his 2011 campaign trail. Stephen Harper is a conservative who planned to buy warplanes to wage war in the middle east, boost military spending, reduce gun control, and has much of his backing from conservative religious communities. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoOno">Yoko Ono</a> was so displeased, she demanded that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> pull all videos of the performance.
<ul><li> During this performance, his only comment was "I might get in trouble for that line!" referring to "Imagine there's no heaven." 'Cause, you know, that's the most jarring part of a pro-war state leader singing a song about world peace through enlightened anarchy.
</li><li> PM Harper had earlier sang <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' "With A Little Help From My Friends" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em> with the Toronto Philharmonic Orchestra during a parliamentary crisis in which all the other party leaders threatened to band together and form a coalition government against him.
<ul><li> Including the line "I get high with a little help from my friends". Harper's government is staunchly anti-drug, and he says he's never used any himself.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Former British prime minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a> attempted to give his "New Labour" makeover mass credibility and some glamour by pulling in stars of music, theatre, and TV to Downing Street parties and receptions. He called his new era <em>Cool Britannia</em>. Had he or his party wonks properly done their homework, they would have realised this is the title of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBonzoDogBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBonzoDogBand">Bonzo Dog Doodah Band</a> musical parody from thirty years previously, when Britain was being called "cool" for different reasons in 1967. The musical pranksters performed a deliberately discordant and amateurish jazzed-up version of <em>Rule Britannia</em> with extremely corny new lyrics, involving what was then in-slang being sung in a very plummy British accent that palpably fails to sound cool or with-it. <em>Cool Britannia, Britannia, you are cool! (Take a trip!)/Britons ever, ever, ever, shall be hip! Groovy, mama!</em> After this was pointed out, Blair's big idea of Cool Britannia was quietly dropped. It is understood that surviving Bonzos such as Neil Innes put in a claim against the British government for copyright money for the use of their intellectual property... They certainly, very pointedly, revived the piece for reunion gigs in the early 2000's, dedicating it to Tony (Blair) and Gordon (Brown).
<ul><li> In Blair's defense, the pun is sort of obvious.
</li></ul></li><li> In a reverse of the way it usually goes (ironic song being used unironically), ads for Discovery Channel's show <em>Who The [Bleep] Did I Marry?!,</em> about people who married criminals without knowing their histories, used the first few lines of Peter, Bjorn, and John's "Young Folks" (<em>If you knew the things I did before, told you who I used to be, would you go along with me?</em>). The lyrics are meant to invoke sleaziness and artifice in their use in the commercial... But in the <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/51V1VMkuyx0">actual song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, not only are they not malicious (seeming to be more about past relationships than anything else), the female singer implies she has a similar past (unlike in the show).
</li><li> Michelle Bachmann attempted to use Tom Petty's "American Girl", often thought to be about a young girl committing suicide, as her campaign anthem. Tom Petty successfully forced her to pick something else.
</li><li> According to Ian Broudie, both the Conservative and Labour parties approached him about using the Lightning Seeds' "Lucky You" as a campaign anthem in 1997. They really hadn't paid attention to the song, which is <em>made of</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">Lyrical Dissonance</a>. (And that aside, quite why Labour would think a song whose <em>hook</em> goes "everything's blue now, oh lucky you" would be a good song for them, remains a mystery.)
</li><li> During his appearance on CPAC 2014, Rand Paul used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chumbawamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chumbawamba">Chumbawamba</a>'s "Tubthumping" as his intro music. The song has its own entry in the "music" tab to explain exactly why a Republican Senator and presidential hopeful for 2016 trying to evoke how the conservatives may not have the presidency but still intend to be heard probably should <em>not</em> be using that song.
</li><li> During the 2016 presidential primaries, Donald Trump angered both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> for using their respective songs, "Keep On Rockin' In The Free World" and "It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" during campaign events. Both Young and R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe ended up endorsing Bernie Sanders' campaign, the former personally allowing him to use his song.
<ul><li> For more bizarre context, "It's The End Of The World As We Know It" was specifically played before Trump spoke about the <em>Iran nuclear deal,</em> and it's probably the least reassuring song one could choose for such a high-stakes topic.
</li><li> The song that was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/nov/09/how-you-cant-always-get-what-you-want-became-donald-trumps-bizarre-theme-song">ultimately played the most<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during Trump's campaign (also without permission), though? "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">You Can't Always Get What You Want</a>". Not only is it a rather odd choice for a <em>political campaign</em> song, Trump even played it <em>after his victory speech</em>.
</li><li> During the 2016 Republican National Convention, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a>'s estate was upset when "Here Comes The Sun" was played, writing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">If it had been Beware of Darkness, then we MAY have approved it!"</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> band members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianMay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianMay">Brian May</a> and Roger Taylor were peeved when "We Will Rock You" was played there, too.
</li><li> Donald Trump used "High Hopes" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PanicAtTheDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PanicAtTheDisco">Panic! at the Disco</a> for his reelection campaign, again without permission. Not only is the song written by pro-gay progressive Brendon Urie, but it's about achieving success from nothing but high hopes. Regardless of your opinions about Trump, he was born into wealth and this description thus does not apply to him.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sabaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sabaton">Sabaton</a> song <em>The Last Stand</em> has become something of an anti-Islamic anthem for the Alt-Right (as well as people making memes about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">The Crusades</a>, on a lighter note). Which is odd, because if you listen to the verses instead of just the chorus, the forces besieging "the home of the Holy" are <em>Protestants</em>; it's about the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> of the Swiss Guard defending the Pope during the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(1527)">1527 sack of Rome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> Two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a> examples from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC">BBC</a> Radio 4:
<ul><li> Their financial programme "Money Box" used the intro from "Money"... which is about the <em>evils</em> of finance.
</li><li> Their programme "Medicine Now" used... "Run like Hell". Whoever chose that had a <em>wicked</em> sense of humour.
</li></ul></li><li> The Ken Bruce Show on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC">BBC</a> Radio 2 deals with romantic dedications from listeners by throwing them all together into a feature called "The Love Song" which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>... usually. But it has also included such decidedly unromantic numbers as "At Seventeen" by Janis Ian (which is about teen angst), both the George Benson and Whitney Houston versions of "The Greatest Love Of All" (which is about self-reliance), and "Song For Whoever" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeautifulSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeautifulSouth">The Beautiful South</a> (which is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuseAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuseAbuse">Muse Abuse</a>).
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Theater </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A rare example of this being done by the original songwriter is "Unworthy of Your Love" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenSondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a>. Originally the song appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Assassins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Assassins">Assassins</a></em> and was a creepy duet between John Hinckley and Lynnette "Squeaky" Fromme about their obsessive loves for Jodie Foster and Charlie Manson respectively, which would lead to Hinckley attempting to assassinate President Reagan and Fromme attempting to assassinate President Ford. The creepiness is all the more effective because it's so low-key and the lyrics only slightly exaggerate the usual extravagant language of love songs... which made it easy to pluck it from its context and stick it into the revue <em>Putting It Together</em>, in which it's meant to be taken at face value.
</li><li> There's a video clip somewhere of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaLansbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaLansbury">Angela Lansbury</a> (the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyToddTheDemonBarberOfFleetStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyToddTheDemonBarberOfFleetStreet">Mrs. Lovett</a>) singing "Not While I'm Around" in concert, and describing how comforting she finds the song. Which is fair enough (in the original it's a sincere if misguided song of devotion by a different character), but somewhat ironic, given that Mrs. Lovett only sings it as an incredibly creepy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise">Dark Reprise</a> to lure out a character she intends to murder.
<ul><li> To make it even more hilarious, a review summary of the concert <a class="urllink" href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/305626/The-Mormon-Tabernacle-Choir-The-Joy-of-Christmas-With-Angela-Lansbury/overview">(here)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> says Angela "performs such holiday gems as "We Need a Little Christmas" and "Not While I'm Around"". Describing a song from Sweeney Todd as a holiday gem is something of a stretch.
<ul><li> For that matter, "We Need a Little Christmas" in its original context (the musical <em>Mame</em>) is about the characters celebrating the holiday <em>early</em> in order to pick themselves up after losing everything in the stock market crash of 1929.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> video well-known among Sweeney Todd fans features a slideshow of horse pictures... the background song is "My Friends". Apparently the little girl who made it had no idea that the original song was about knives and murder. Especially the line "You'll soon drip precious rubies" caused hilarity to ensue.
<ul><li> That same little girl did an anti-animal cruelty video with the background song being "Remember" by Josh Groban. While animal cruelty is indeed horrible, this girl doesn't know that the song is about Greek mythology and how the gods were obsessed with going down in history. Quite frankly this little girl apparently just heard the words "remember me" and made the video.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also a video of a little girl singing "Green Finch and Linnet Bird" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyTodd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyTodd">Sweeney Todd</a>. The song isn't that creepy, if quite sad, on its own, but when you consider that Johanna is singing about cages as a metaphor for being molested by an insane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile">ephebophile</a>...
</li><li> Unless the singer is actually performing in <em>Oliver!</em>, they will <em>not</em> perform "As Long As He Needs Me" as a battered woman making excuses for staying with the scumbag. The lines "Who else would love him still/When they've been used so ill?" never, ever survives a cover, needless to say.
<ul><li> It was used to rather hilarious effect on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoAndAHalfMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoAndAHalfMen">Two and a Half Men</a></em> in a situation that actually <em>highlighted</em> and inverted its inappropriateness as a love song by using it as accompaniment to a montage in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> Rose lavishes affection and attention on a helplessly ill Charlie. The thing is, Rose got Charlie sick in the first place and was keeping him that way so she could indulge her romantic feelings for him.
</li></ul></li><li> Songs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DearEvanHansen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DearEvanHansen">Dear Evan Hansen</a></em> are often used in an inspirational or heartwarming context, especially "You Will Be Found" and "For Forever." The finale that reprises both of these songs was used for the "In Memoriam" segment of the 72nd Tony Awards, for example. The problem is, many of the songs Evan sings, while they do carry genuine emotions, are used to lie to the classmates and family of a suicide victim for Evan's own emotional gain.
</li><li> Many people on the internet associate the words "give 'em the old razzle dazzle" <a class="urllink" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-ol-razzle-dazzle">with humorous pictures of people or animals that seem to be dancing.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The original song, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Chicago">Chicago</a></em>, is the musical's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> bragging about how he uses flair and showmanship to get his clients (i.e. murderers) acquitted in court.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RumbleRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RumbleRoses">Rumble Roses</a></em>, the song Yankee Rose is used for the entrance music of a character and the intro. The character is Dixie Clements, a Texan, who would probably punch you if you called her a Yankee. (Plus she's a tad more modest than the lyrics describe, but then again, considering the game...) Somewhat justified because outside the USA, most countries (including Japan, where the game is made) use Yankee to mean any American. Still, one can't help but think they just looked at the Rose in the title...

<ul><li> General Electric using "Sixteen Tons" in a clean coal commercial. <br/>But the lyrics to the chorus go: <em>You haul Sixteen Tons, whadaya get  / Another day older and deeper in debt  / Saint Peter don't call cause I can't go / I owe my soul to the company store</em>. <br/>"This is a classic example of someone breaking the Golden Rule of advertising: never imply that your product or service prevents people from getting into heaven. Obviously on a rational level, we know that General Electric doesn't make coal miners sign over their souls, but they don't seem overly eager to distance themselves from the practice either. Probably just leaving their options open. Y'know, in case the unions start acting up again."
</li><li> The "Look What They've Done to My Song, Ma" example from Oatmeal Raisin Crisp is used, because "they wanted you to look at what they'd done to their oatmeal. The lyrics of the song were so close to matching up perfectly to the ad's message, they just needed a tiny adjustment. So they changed the chorus from "look what they've done to my song, ma" to "look what they've done to my oatmeal." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Because "oatmeal" totally rhymes with "song, ma."</a> The problem is, said lyrics, according to Cracked, are written in such a way that they give "the impression that some shadowy government agency has taken General Mills oatmeal, put raisins in it against its will, and now they're trying to stir up public outrage." There is also, of course, the obvious irony inherent in a group of advertisers fucking up a song bemoaning advertisers constantly fucking up their songs.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> used Filter's "Hey Man Nice Shot", a song about Bud Dwyer's televised suicide, for a basketball scene. The lyric "A man has gun/Hey man have fun" could even clearly be heard.
</li><li> In the pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllenGregory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllenGregory">Allen Gregory</a></em>, after the titular character meets his principal for the first time, he starts fantasizing about himself having all sorts of romantic encounters with her. This fantasy sequence is set to the chorus of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a>' "In the Air Tonight"... the very same "In the Air Tonight" that, in its verses, features lyrics like "Well, if you told me you were drowning/I would not lend a hand", and, for extra points, was inspired by Collins' divorce from his first wife.
