For immediately beforehand, Decatur had toasted: "To our country! In her intercourse with foreign nations, may she always be in the right." Later, the USA's Senator Carl Schurz gave his own interpretation of the statement: "My country, right or wrong; <em>if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right</em>." This latter take, along with similar anecdotes from others, has also come into prominence in how both nationalism and patriotism are portrayed.

<ul><li> Most of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> are rank-and-file soldiers of the evil Amestris. The average soldier only cares about fighting for their country and the good of the people, and to their misfortune, their leaders are total sociopaths who have pulled out all the stops in ritual sacrifice to obtain godhood / immortality, and will gleefully order their army to massacre civilians under the false crime of revolution. Roy Mustang's entire storyline is about derailing the chain of command until he can get enough of the army on his side to perform a <em>real</em> revolution against the corrupt government.
</li><li> A few of the Zeon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> are portrayed as this. It just so happens that Gihren Zabi is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">based off of Hitler</a>.
<ul><li> The Zabi family was large and varied, producing not only scheming villains like Giren and Kycilia but also such people as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> brothers, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide-Eyed Idealist</a> Garma and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValor">valiant</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">noble</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Four-Star Badass</a> Dozle. Whose daughter just so happens to be the protagonist in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em> series.
</li><li> Ramba Ral is a particularly stand-out example. Despite the fact that the Zabi family <em>had his father killed</em> as part of a nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a> that began with the death of Zeon's former leader, at the end of the day he's still a Zeon soldier and they're still the royal family (it does help that he works for the comparatively decent Dozle Zabi, who probably had nothing directly to do with the whole mess). This comes back to bite him when he comes to Earth to fight the Gundam, since the Earth Attack Force command, under Kycilia's authority continually stiff him on supplies and support, possibly because they don't believe he could really be that loyal, more likely due to simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction">Jurisdiction Friction</a>, and he continues to soldier on with what he knows to be a suicide mission regardless.
</li><li> Many characters from various <em>Gundam</em> series are examples, though countries seldom matter and it's often loyalty to other institutions, e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> has Sergei Smirnov, who dislikes actions such as the HRL's Supersoldier project or the world government's A-Law's actions, but he stays loyal to them. Except that he quite openly schemes behind the A-Laws' backs and leaks intel on them to Celestial Being.
</li></ul></li><li> It's a given, considering the series, but several countries in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> are portrayed as this, especially WWII Germany, who expresses open disgust at some of the orders he's been given, but has to follow them anyway. Or Russia's growing anger at Stalin despite being more or less fine with communism. Considering that all of the characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">personifications</a> of their countries. They aren't bound to a particular government, leader, or ideology as they represent their people as a whole. Which includes their ideas/cultures/beliefs/what-have-you in general. Plus, autocratic governments can hardly be considered representative of their people in the same way as democratic ones, so it makes sense for their countries to hold different opinions to their rulers - and also to be unable to stop them. Dictators don't hold elections unless they know they will win.
</li><li> The Britannians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, even if their rulers oppress others and promote racial supremacy. Also, Suzaku, who fights for the lawful authority of a region, even if he obtained that authority by brutally conquering his own country.
</li></ul><ul><li> Gajeel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> is this, which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is what makes the members of Fairy Tail eventually accept him after the events of the Phantom Lord Arc</span>. Gajeel is also majorly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, which translates to something like having a really mean guard dog that will do everything possible to protect its owner.
<ul><li> Several members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Spriggan Twelve</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Alvarez</a> are unlike anything Fairy Tail has fought before in the series; not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerers</a>, not murderers and cultists, but soldiers, many of whom see the war as nothing more than fighting for their country. The fact that Emperor Spriggan is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zeref</a></span> doesn't even enter the equation for most of them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Brandish</a> in particular, despite openly disagreeing with the Emperor, spends much of the conflict insisting that as a proud citizen of Alvarez, she cannot and will not betray her homeland.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Byakuya Kuchiki <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeLawfulOrGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeLawfulOrGood">sided with the law</a> when his sister Rukia was arrested and scheduled for execution. Despite disagreeing with the situation, he was bound by his social position, his military position, and a promise he had once made over his dead parents' honor. As an aristocratic role-model for society in general, he was trapped by the fact that he could not expect others to uphold the law if he broke the law whenever it personally inconvenienced him. As a captain in the Gotei 13, he was expected to obey the orders of the Central 46 without question or hesitation. And, in his past, after having thrown his family into chaos by breaking the rules to both marry a commoner and then honour her deathbed request to adopt and protect her sister (Rukia) as his own, he made a promise to his parents' tomb that he would never break the rules again. Rukia's execution forced him to choose between those two conflicting vows but the sheer weight behind the vow to uphold the law meant that was the vow he had to choose no matter what his personal feelings may have been about it.
</li><li> Yamamoto was also this. Ukitake was Rukia's captain and determined to protect her no matter what and Kyouraku found the whole situation suspicious and wanted to halt the execution until it could be investigated. Both captains broke the law by refusing to uphold the decision of the Central 46 without question and sealing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon">execution weapon</a> to ensure Rukia couldn't be executed. Yamamoto, incensed by their betrayal and making exactly the same argument Byakuya had made to Ichigo (that society takes precedence over the personal), proceeded to engage them in a fight that would have been to the death had the truth about Rukia's execution not come out in an extremely timely fashion. His personal opinion on the matter of Rukia's execution is never revealed, to him, it didn't matter if it was right or wrong. Upholding one's duty was the only 'right' he was interested in.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yashamaru loved his sister Karura and his nephew Gaara, and as a result despised his brother-in-law Rasa, the Fourth Kazekage, for sealing Shukaku into Gaara while he was still in Karura's womb, killing her and dooming Gaara to a life of loneliness and insanity.

It ends up costing them everything that <em>truly</em> matters, leaving them either dead or thoroughly broken.
<ul><li> Annie states that her father was fiercely devoted, and raised her for the purpose of serving their homeland. He realized his horrible mistake too late, and her final memories of him were him weeping and pleading for forgiveness. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> 4 years later, he's a disillusioned and broken man clinging to the hope that his daughter is still alive, somewhere</span>.

<ul><li> Indeed, Cachat's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">plan</a> in "Fanatic" depended on the majority of the Havenite officers and enlisted being decent people, <em>including</em> many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> officers (consider that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> is normally presented as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a>, and only <em>mildly</em> lawful at that). A man in Cachat's position would be in a position to guess which way those particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> officers would move.
</li><li> Cachat himself subscribes strongly to the <em>"if wrong, to be set right"</em> interpretation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">stopping shy of nothing</a> to do so.
</li><li> Another Havenite example was Amos Parnell, the former head of their space navy. Thought executed, he was discovered and rescued from a prison planet, and despite having every reason to utterly hate the current government of Haven, refused to provide intelligence that would directly assist the Manticorans in battle against Havenite forces. However, he does testify about the coup and helps destroy the new government's prestige.
<ul><li> In contrast, he convinces the much younger and more idealistic Havenite officer Warner Caslet to defect. When Caslet attempts to invoke this trope, Parnell shuts him down. "Son, you don't have a country anymore." In Caslet's case, recent circumstances outside his control had guaranteed that Caslet would be executed or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">disappeared</a> if he returned to Havenite territory.
</li></ul></li><li> Thomas Theisman articulates this thought several times when considering Alfredo Yu, his own mentor who defected, and Warner Caslet, one of his subordinates whom he considers an honest, integral man who wanted nothing more than to defend his nation and was driven into defection. Theisman understands and empathises with them both, while still deciding that he cannot follow in their footsteps because he is loyal to the Republic, if not to its leadership. Theisman himself, however, is someone who takes the full Schulz quote as his motto, including the part about "if wrong, to be set right." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end of Book 9, he shoots Citizen Chairman Saint-Just and restores the old Republic.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Several characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em> have the attitude My <em>Church</em> Right or Wrong, agreeing with the Cahrisians that the Vicarate is hopelessly corrupt but unwilling to raise arms against The Church.
<ul><li> The Earl of Thirsk is probably the best example, feeling obligated to fight Charis but doing his best to fight an honorable and just war. Given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a> is the author of both series many fans have made comparisons to Thomas Theisman (see above). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Like Theisman he follows through with "to be set right" teaming up with other nobles and some of the decent priests to overthrow the Inquisition in Dohlar, convince the king to abdicate in favor of his son (with Thirsk as Regent) and make peace with Charis.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Many imperials in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars</a></em> universe use varying degrees of this trope. Some desert right away after Battle of Endor. Others remain loyal until the interim government implodes. Some defect or desert after they become sickened by their commanding officers or realize that the Empire has lost unity.
<ul><li> Pellaeon remains loyal to the person who has the most legal claim to the government and later commands the Remnant. However, as time goes on he realizes that the Remnant must change its racist policies to survive.
</li><li> It wasn't just Imperials, either. Han Solo had a bad case of "My planet, right or wrong" that alienated his whole family and ended up sparking a second civil war in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">Legacy of the Force</a></em> series. It started to show up during the first Corellian insurrection when Thrackan first sized power, but disaster was averted until later on, despite its leader, his cousin, not being killed when someone had the chance. He hated Thrackan and his humanocentric policies, but let his loyalty to Corellia itself cause a LOT of trouble. He finally did come to his senses and repair the family rift, and work with Boba Fett to get rid of Thrackan, but the damage was already done and the war underway.
</li></ul></li><li> Günter Bischoff, the U-Boat captain in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cryptonomicon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a></em> starts off like this (he's definitely not a Nazi), but ends up just looking for a way out of the whole thing.
</li><li> Oberst Kurt Steiner from <em>The Eagle Has Landed</em>. He actually risked his life trying to save a Jewish girl from death. He is then court-martialed, along with a platoon of his men. They are then given the job of kidnapping Churchill. One of them rescues a local girl from a water wheel and is killed in the process. So it is obvious that they are good guys, yet they still fight for Nazi Germany. In an aversion, it is hinted that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Steiner hesitates when he has a chance to shoot Churchill because he knows it is wrong and is himself then shot and apparently killed</span>.
</li><li> <em>Soldier X</em> might fit here. The main character talks about how, as a teacher, the new students always stare at him because he is missing an arm. When they inevitably ask about it, he reveals that he lost it in WWII and someone always comments "it had to be done". However, the main character was a conscript in the Wehrmacht (although it is a little more complicated...).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers">The Three Musketeers</a></em>, Rochefort is depicted as an honourable opponent of the eponymous musketeers. Although, there, it's more a case of "My <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">Boss</a> (Cardinal Richelieu), Right or Wrong", as both he and the musketeers are loyal to France.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em>, this is the attitude that Corporal Strappi preaches. Sergeant Jackrum also follows this, but at the end, retires to find out, as he put it, "what I've been fighting for" his entire life.
</li><li> Eric von Shrakenberg of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDraka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDraka">The Draka</a></em> takes this trope to a whole new level, given that the country he is fighting for is the Domination of Draka, which makes Nazi Germany look tame by comparison. Although he views the Draka ideology and society as a cultural dead-end, he is arguably the single most important individual in Draka history, playing a key role in both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Eurasian War</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">The Final War</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RuledBritannia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RuledBritannia">Ruled Britannia</a></em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> novel where the Spanish Armada succeeded and occupied England, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> (Yes, <em>the</em> William Shakespeare) admits that, if given a choice, he probably would choose to follow the Roman Catholic traditions of Spain as opposed to the Protestant teachings of England, but he refuses to let these traditions be forced onto the country at gunpoint. Thus, he helps launch the rebellion that topples the government of Queen Isabella and frees the imprisoned Queen Elizabeth, even if that means he will need to become a Protestant again, because, at least then, it would be by England's choice.
<ul><li> Also a recurring theme in Turtledove's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191">Timeline191</a> series with citizens in the Confederate States, since they are the analogue to Germany. Clarence Potter is the most notable - he despises Jake Featherston personally and feels his temperament is ill-suited to the Presidency. But he also saves Featherston from a black assassin and a planned military coup, on the grounds that eliminating him would only lead to the CSA being conquered by the more powerful U.S.
</li></ul></li><li> A minor recurring theme in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo">1632</a></em> series, as we repeatedly see people from "enemy" nations who recognize based on the foresight/hindsight provided by reading the uptime history books that their countries are in the wrong at LEAST practically if not morally (such as upholding serfdom), but serve their country regardless even when rulers fail to recognize the warnings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Biggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Biggles">Biggles</a></em> antagonist Erich von Stalhein: "Germany meant more to me than Hitler ever did. It still does." He is quite explicitly a German nationalist and seems listless whenever not serving its interests, even working for the Soviets, despite being a monarchist to the core himself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarknessAtNoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarknessAtNoon">Darkness at Noon</a></em>, Rubashov's background was that of a faithful enforcer of the Party line who publicly upheld the principle of the Party's infallibility, though privately admitting that it had turned against the principles of the Revolution that he had fought in. Ivanov questions why he does not see himself as a traitor.
</li><li> In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedStormRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedStormRising">Red Storm Rising</a></em>, Alekseyev serves the Soviet Union, all while having private doubts about whether what the country is doing is legitimate or worthwhile, particularly staging a bombing of the Kremlin that killed several children early in the novel.
</li><li> Captain Laurence from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire">Temeraire</a></em> series is deeply devoted to Britain, and his sense of duty is what constantly drives the plot — he hated the thought of taking on a dragon but did it because he thought it was right. However, he finally draws the line when he hears of a British plan to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> infect every French dragon with a fatal disease, and let to spread and kill every non-British dragon in the world despite them being sentient beings</span>, which finally prompts him to turn traitor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarelCapek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarelCapek">Karel Čapek</a> wrote a short story called "Pseudo-Lot or Concerning Patriotism", a take on the Biblical story of Lot. In his version, when the angels come to Lot and tell them that Sodom is about to be destroyed, he realizes that as much as he hates the sins of the people of Sodom, he cannot leave them now that they're about to die.
</li><li> Commodore Smith displays this at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackTideRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackTideRising">Strands of Sorrow</a></em>. A newly rescued government official becomes acting President and immediately orders the resumption of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieAdvocate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieAdvocate">Zombie Advocate</a> policies that let the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> get traction in the first place. She also talks about charging the surviving military with war crimes under the justification that the hordes of zombies they've killed were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie">technically alive</a>, despite pre-ZA testimony from the CDC establishing that the infection is irreversible. Rather than stage a military coup, Smith merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaBargain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaBargain">acquiesces to house arrest under the condition that his troops face no charges</a>. And rather than plan any sort of assassination, Smith's daughters resolve the situation by rescuing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> who outranks the Secretary of Education.
</li><li> As the plan gets underway in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DebtOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DebtOfHonor">Debt of Honor</a></em>, several Japanese characters struggle to decide if their loyalty should be to their nation as she is, even though that means going along with the crazy, or if it should be to Japan as she ought to be, even if working for the good of the nation may involve giving away secrets in a manner that might be deemed treasonous.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Princess Lara</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBridgeKingdomArchives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBridgeKingdomArchives">The Bridge Kingdom Archives</a></em>.

</li><li> A major theme in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></em>. The main characters understand perfectly well why Barrayar is viewed by many as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilEmpire">The Evil Empire</a> and are doing the best they can to be just in an unjust world. Miles, despite having command of a mercenary fleet that could take him anywhere in the galaxy, remains loyal to a planet that reviles him as a mutant (as he frequently points out, he's actually just a cripple), to the consternation of his female partners who have no desire to settle down with him in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">No Woman's Land</a>, and cannot fathom why his mother (who shows a similar loyalty to her adopted home) would choose to <em>immigrate</em> there.

<ul><li> In the episode "Endgame", General Lefcourt leads the ships loyal to the Clark regime. As he puts it, "I'm from the old school: a soldier doesn't take up arms against his own government, no matter how justified you feel doing it." That said, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">President Clark sets up Earth's defense grid to scorch the planet rather than let Sheridan win, Lefcourt destroys the last orbital defense platform that Sheridan's fleet couldn't reach.</span> He only did so after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clark was dead, and thus no longer President; given Luchenko's rise to Presidency, presumably Earthgov has an analogue of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFifthAmendment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFifthAmendment">Twenty-Fifth Amendment</a>.</span> It turns out that many members of Earthforce had that same mindset, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Babylon 5's later CO, Captain Elizabeth Lochley</span>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/086.html">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/093.html">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Lefcourt's mindset does invite the question of whether he would have followed an immoral order and allowed the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> orbital defense grid</span> to kill millions of people.
</li><li> Many officers refused to obey immoral orders during the Earth Alliance Civil War. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Alliance_Civil_War">[3]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Alliance_Civil_War">[4]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.firstones.com/wiki/Earth_Civil_War_(2260-61)">[5]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.firstones.com/tp2b/history_civil_war.html">[6]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> This trope gets a very thorough working over through the course of the show, particularly in the latter three seasons. The fifth season addition to the cast of an Earth Force Captain who refused to join Sheridan's faction in the civil war adds an ongoing layer of character friction. The officer in question, Babylon 5's new CO Captain Elizabeth Lochley, repeats Sheridan's (correct) assertion that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">you do not follow an unlawful order</a>, but also argues that the solution isn't to go into open rebellion against your own government.
</li><li> Captain Sheridan himself also qualifies. Clark appointed him to command the station because by all appearances he was a staunch loyalist. What Clark didn't count on was that Sheridan was staunchly loyal to the Earth Alliance <em>Constitution</em>, rather than being loyal to the government that was violating that Constitution. He ended up fulfilling the second part of the quote: "<em>if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right.</em>"
</li><li> Moving away from Earth, Londo Mollari has patriotism as his ultimate motivation for nearly everything he does, including repeating the party line regarding the Centauri treatment of the Narns. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even when he arranges to assassinate Emperor Cartagia, he's doing it chiefly to protect the Centauri people from a bonafide <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">lunatic</a></em>.</span>

<ul><li> Despite knowing what Aerys did to Lyanna's father and brother and that he planned to have her entire family wiped out, Rhaegar still fought for his father during Robert's rebellion.
</li><li> Tyrion Lannister. "My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family." Of course, while he's being entirely sarcastic when he says it, he does tend to go along with what's expected of him in the end  if not exactly in a manner the rest of his family approves of. This becomes a source of conflict for him after Sansa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> following the Red Wedding and when he meets Oberyn Martell. Both of them lost family members to atrocities ordered and/or enabled by his father and King Joffrey and he's torn between obvious sympathy and compassion for their plight and his loyalty to Lannister hegemony. This ends up backfiring on him spectacularly since his public disapproval of his nephew leads people to accuse him of disloyalty in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> trial. He then decides once and for all that he will no longer be a loyal Lannister retainer and shoots his father's plans to save face and send him to the Wall. When the trial by combat ends in failure for him, he's released by Jaime so as to flee Westeros, but before he leaves he burns his final bridge by killing his father. Of course it's one thing for Tyrion to fight Lannisters he dislikes (Tywin and Cersei) but another for him to fight against Lannisters he likes, namely Jaime, and in Season 7, Dany rebukes him for suggesting a softball strategy rather than a ruthless one because he doesn't want to go against Jaime. This becomes obvious when after Dany listens to his suggestion to lay siege and encircle the capital, they come upon the Lannister train carrying the pillage of the Reach back to the city near Blackwater, and the resulting battle sees Jaime charging at Dany with a spear all the while Tyrion watches in horror muttering "No" to his brave, foolish, Cersei-serving brother.

He met another immortal who fought for the South. He said that the other immortal was on the wrong side; the other immortal acknowledged that he was, but said that he had made ties with his neighbors and friends and didn't feel like he could turn away from them.
</li><li> Bryce from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaxHeadroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MaxHeadroom">Max Headroom</a></em> is loyal to the TV company Network XXIII, to the point of trying to kill Edison Carter in the first episode. But Bryce is doing it only because it was ordered of him, and he bears no genuine malice. He just wants to play with computers. This is only true of Bryce in the American version, however; in the original British Made-for-TV movie, Bryce is not only wholly unsympathetic but killing Carter <em>is his idea in the first place</em>.

It's not hard to imagine that things would be much worse with someone else in his place, and he ends up being probably the most sympathetic villain in the series' history; as he lies shot at the end, he even generates a degree of compassion and respect from Rollin, who takes time to help staunch the bleeding before making his escape.

Subverted in that he eventually makes the decision to defy the Central Command and help the dissidents escape. Possibly double-subverted, as Garak's only explanation for doing this is that he 'loves Cardassia', framing even this act of defiance against the Central Command as in the service of the Cardassian people. In another episode, he's quite content with how his people treat orphans left behind on Bajor, rationalizing that it's just how one is supposed to act:
<div class="indent"><strong>Garak:</strong> Children without parents have no status in Cardassian society. The situation is most unfortunate, but <em>I don't make the rules</em>.
</div></li><li> Really, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country, Right or Wrong</a> is the guiding principle for all Cardassians, all the time. The problem is that each of them has a different idea about what's good for the empire, ranging from "I should be the ruler because I am obviously the right man for the job" to "The Cardassians need to own up to the crimes in our past."
</li><li> One Cardassian tried to pass himself off as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gul Darhe'el</span>, the commander in charge of a brutal Bajoran concentration camp, and be arrested and charged with war crimes which he gleefully admitted to and showed great pleasure in. In truth, he was a simple file clerk that was stationed there and was tortured by the inhumanity of the situation and haunted about his inability to do anything. He only played up on the role in the hopes that he would be prosecuted, all For the Good of Cardassia.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kira:</strong> <em>[after exposing his true identity]</em> Why are you doing this? <br/><strong><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aamin Marritza</span>:</strong> For Cardassia! The only way Cardassia will survive is if it stands before Bajor and admits the truth! My trial will force Cardassia to acknowledge its guilt, and we're guilty, all of us! My death is necessary.
</div></li><li> Damar goes so far as to form the resistance inside of Cardassia because the Dominion stopped treating them as equals. He was willing to kill his trusted right-hand man because the guy was ready to quit after the Dominion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">made it personal</a>. Damar eulogizes that the deceased was a good and loyal citizen to a Cardassia that no longer exists.

In one case, a Jem'hadar realizes that the unusually poor strategy of the Vorta would lead to his entire unit being killed in the attack and expressly recognizes that they were betrayed by the Vorta, but still conducts the attack as planned.

It's simpler to name the people who don't wrestle with it in the series. Kira, whose actions during the occupation were explicitly terroristic, found herself at odds with her new role as a soldier of a legitimate government. Julian Bashir was often at odds with Starfleet's own brand of this Trope. Sisko had to struggle with complacency in a political assassination for the good of the Federation. Worf had to wrestle with his ideals of what it means to be Klingon with the fact that not all Klingons are paragons of Klingon virtue. Quark faced conflicts against Ferengi society versus his loyalty to friends and family.

He exemplifies the trope well enough that in the fandom, the "Camus Archetype" refers to antagonists with sympathetic personalities and motives who nonetheless cannot be convinced to join your army and must be defeated. Fortunately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he survives and is recruitable in the 3rd game.</span>
</li><li> Subverted, however, with Lorenz from the same country (and the same map). Caeda is able to persuade him that if the king's actions are hurting the people of his country, then he has a duty to overthrow the king to protect his people, an argument he is not able to find a counter for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em> has a few examples.
<ul><li> Eldigan of Nordion, best friends with Sigurd and Quan, and the brother of Princess Raquesis, who fought because Agustrian usurper King Chagall threatened to smear mud on his name. And if you don't fight him and, instead, get Raquesis the Earth Sword, Eldigan will still be executed by Chagall and the Cross Knights will continue to battle you.
</li><li> Ishtar from the same game's second generation. She's kind-hearted enough to be the best friend of Teeny/Linda, despite Ishtar's mother abusing them, she seriously questions the Child Hunts promoted by her country and tries to minimize the damage as best as she can, but she's too duty-bound with the honor of her family and country (and being in love with pre-possession Julius), in which Seliph's army has caused many casualties on, that she cannot be recruited and made her last stand in the name of those she's bound to, dying in the process.
</li><li> Subverted, meanwhile, with Jamke of Verdane. He's unable to persuade his father not to follow the advice of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> Sandima and takes to the battlefield on their orders.

Gale tells her that he cannot be with her, despite spending so much time together. He also tells Miledy's brother Zeiss that, no matter what, they must fight. What makes it worse is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gale is considered dead even if you don't kill him.</span>
</li><li> Another <em>The Binding Blade</em> example is Brenya, who is portrayed much like Selena would later be. Despite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Zephiel's death</span> in the last chapter, she still carries out his orders, even if it means death. Even after being told that surrender is an option, she won't take it.
</li><li> And again in <em>The Binding Blade</em> is the Etrurian Generals, especially Douglas, since he downright refuses to join you even if you talk to him with General Cecilia, General Percival, Vice-General Klein, AND his adopted daughter Lalam/his liege Prince Mildain (Elphin). He only joins you later when Etruria officially accepts your army, AKA when you defeat the chapter with Douglas still alive, allowing you access to 16x.

She was recruited in the Shrine of Seals battle so as to keep loyal to her liege, Prince Zephiel. More specifically, she states that she serves Bern, and joins Eliwood's army because they saved the life of Prince Zephiel, who is the future ruler of her country. She embodies this trope perfectly whilst employing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> out of a sense of honour.
</li><li> General Eagler from Lyn's Tale. Especially tragic case because, if Sain and Kent (and a civilian in a nearby house) are to be believed, he might have been forced to fight by having his family taken into custody by Lundgren.

Bryce is appalled at what Ashnard says but is still loyal enough to go out to die, and Ashnard breaks out into a fit of laughter, mocking his notion of chivalry.
</li><li> In the following game, General Levail of Begnion can be seen in a similar situation as Bryce: he knows of how corrupt the Begnion Senate is (he was the commander of Vice-Minister Lekain's personal army) and wishes that it isn't so, but he still fights you out of loyalty to Zelgius, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">AKA the Black Knight</span>.
</li><li> Zelgius himself may count. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zelgius is loyal to the Begnion Senate only because he's loyal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Sephiran</a>, who wants him to help incite a war that will swallow the world, which is the same reason the Black Knight served Daein</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Micaiah</a> fits this trope perfectly in <em>Radiant Dawn</em>. She is willing to side with the Begnion Senate in fighting the Laguz alliance - despite the fact that she just led the charge to free Daein from Begnion control, that her home country needs to rebuild, and that she harbors no resentment toward the laguz - all because Daein's spineless Prince Pelleas told her to. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out, Pelleas has to obey the Senate, as he was tricked into signing a blood pact - basically a contract that would kill the citizens of Daein is its owner wills it.</span> She explicitly states that she would gladly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpOffTheSlipperySlope">Jump Off The Slippery Slope</a> if that's what it takes to keep Daein safe (thankfully it never comes to that).
</li><li> <em>FE10</em> plays with this trope with Jill and Zihark most especially; averted in <em>FE9</em>, played straight at the beginning of <em>FE10</em>, and then it depends on whether the player recruits them or not. It gets to the point where they're willing to betray their friends and principles just for their country, which is plainly in the wrong.

Despite his disagreement with certain actions, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like the Bitter Springs massacre</span>, he is still a strong supporter of them, and will outright refuse to come with you if you get on their bad side, though as long as you avoid doing so he has no problems with you siding with House or going Wild Card (though it helps that both of those involve opposing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">Caesar's Legion</a>).
</li><li> Rose of Sharon Cassidy or "Cass" has similar sentiments and provides the page quote. She's an NCR citizen and proud of it, but she realizes that the NCR is an overextended bureaucracy that just can't help the people of the Mojave in their current state, even if they do mean well. She prefers the Courier to side with the NCR for the game's central conflict but doesn't mind the Courier being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">mostly out of loyalty to them</a> (Though it's implied that she's secretly horrified at the Courier for defeating three armies at once).

In an interesting game concept, there are cutscenes of interviews of the Belkan pilots the player fought, depicting them as obviously likable men ten years after the war.
<ul><li> Probably helped by how Belka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">detonated 7 nuclear weapons on their own country late in the war.</span> But the pilots explicitly state that they hold no animosity towards their enemies, during and after the war. It was just war, and it was just what they were trained to do. In fact, many of them <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">revere</a></em> Cipher, the player character, in a decidedly odd twist. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One character even states that Cipher is comparable to the old orders of Belkan Knights, an honor that he doesn't even give <em>himself</em>.</span>

</li><li> Actually he defected prior to it, as he would have been one of the pilots tasked with carrying out the strike mission. Killing millions of your countries citizens, and thousands of soldiers from both sides, will make you question your boss, that's for sure.

Even when he turns on Kefka, he's just trying to remove a piece of rot from the good name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, resulting in an awesomely tragic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kefka reveals that he's acting on the orders of the Emperor</span>, and Leo's fate is sealed by his inherent goodness.

</li><li> In the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>, Cecil (<em>the main protagonist</em>) is the same as Leo above. After a particularly horrible mission given by his king, he becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> instead, kickstarting the plot.

Beatrix's case is much like General Leo's above, while Steiner, being a main party character, is constantly attacked by the queen he's trying to serve. They both come to their senses as the story progresses.
</li><li> General Morgahn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>. He is shown from the beginning to be an honorable officer who is also a loyal subordinate and friend of Varesh Ossa (for instance, he defends the Warmarshal at the joint tribunal following <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the mission in which the player discovers conclusive evidence of Varesh's villainy</span>), though, as the Nightfall campaign proceeds, he expresses increasing concerns and doubts about Varesh's actions and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finally defects to the player's side after Varesh's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> crossing - massacring the priests of his patron goddess, Lyssa.</span>
</li><li> Harpuia of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Mega Man Zero</a></em> is a good example.

Too bad the definition of Maverick has become distorted.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> series does this a lot, essentially, in every game, in accordance with its shades of grey approach to war. In five proper games and several side games/spinoffs, there are less than a half dozen truly evil antagonists and more than a few instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> moments from your own side.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Teo McDohl</span> from the first <em>Suikoden</em>. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he sends his two right-hand men to fight for his son against his emperor.</span>
<ul><li> A number of the generals are this until you beat some sense into them. Many of them still profess loyalty to the emperor even as they join you, but find themselves in opposition to the country's direction under Windy. Most of them rejoin the reformed government.

</li><li> The Zexen Knights in <em>III</em> open the game as this as they, Chris in particular, are opposed to the Zexen council's motives. This leads to a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> with Chris (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Salome removes the corrupt councilmen</span>).
</li><li> Sasarai in <em>III</em> is this. He's not all that elated with seeking out the True Runes in the grasslands but follows through until the issue becomes much larger. Then he finds out that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> cloned from the dear leader as a placeholder for a true rune</span>. Despite this, he still goes back to his position once the war is over.
</li><li> <em>IV</em> has Troy. Given the trend of the games to have these types of characters eventually come around in the end, many fans were disappointed in the lack of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, given that he was one of the few interesting characters in the game.
</li><li> In <em>V</em>, there is a distinct divide on the Queen's nights concerning the Godwin rule. While some of the knights are quick to align with the prince, some align with the Godwins, and another considers his duty to Queen and country rather than any faction.
</li></ul></li><li> General Forsythe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a>: Days of Ruin</em> fights only for the glory of his country, treats commanding officers and soldiers in the New Rubinelle Army with honor and dignity, and refuses to use Caulder's doomsday weapons to take them out. In the one mission where you go toe-to-toe with Forsythe, he actually <em>comes and gives you advice on how to beat him</em>. His AI is not aggressive, as he usually tries to beat you by blocking factories and sending infantries straight to your HQ. When you do beat Forsythe, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he surrenders without a fight, on the sole condition that his army is treated with dignity, and he takes all the blame that his comrades deserve.</span> Honestly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> considering that the player is fighting under Admiral Greyfield's banner</span>, it could be argued that <em>you're</em> on the "bad" side at that point in the game.

A good amount of the enemy generals feel this way, and if you're enough of a dick or just plain unlucky (damn you tarots to hell!), yours begin to think this way as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch">Except for</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">Deneb.</a>

He remains loyal to UNATCO <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even after it is revealed that the organization is just a front for Majestic Twelve.</span> As he puts it, "We've got our share of crooked bureaucrats — fact — but this is still UNATCO, and by and large, the people in this building are twenty-four-carat gold." He does eventually join you against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> anyway, but only after UNATCO kicks him out because they <em>don't think he's loyal enough</em> (or rather, not blindly loyal and able to recognise UNATCO's faults, which is what they don't want).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps">Warship Gunner 2</a></em>, Admiral Amagi of the Imperial Japanese Navy initially aids the player character because Japan is an ally of your nation, but later becomes a recurring enemy when Japan aligns with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> So does Captain Tsukuba if he doesn't become your adjutant.</span>

But as the first Imperial loyalist you could befriend in the game states, Skyrim has always supported the Empire (Talos/Tiber Septim the first Emperor was a Nord) and "The Nords have never been fair-weather friends."

She is surprisingly sisterly with her brother Zuko when he returns home with her and fiercely antagonistic towards him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">upon learning of his defection</span>. If you're against the Fire Nation, hope you don't have to cross her.
