Assuming sex is genetically determined in the usual way, sex ratios in animals tend to even out over time, even though sexual selection would suggest only a handful of males (traditionally the "unlimited", low-investment sex, at least among mammals — birds, for example, are often a totally different story) are actually needed or preferred for a population. Within a <em>population</em> or an explicitly social group, however, sex may or may not play much of a role. For example, the concept of mammals (such as lions and certain species of seal) who have "harems" has been commonly reinterpreted as females tolerating a single male simply due to access to resources his leadership provides, while having more than one is simply bothersome to the group after a certain age. However, this doesn't mean fewer males contribute to the species; many live on their own or in bachelor groups, taking what they can get.

They can even impregnate human women, which they find highly attractive, and actively steal from earth men, <em>whether the women like it or not</em>.
<ul><li> Notably, they <em>used</em> to be a two-gender race, but their men went extinct, and reproduce using technology similar to cloning (they give the females some of the genes from males to make recombination easier- they're genetic hermaphrodites, albeit not physical ones). They could technically become a regular two-gender-race again if they would only mate with human males, but they like things just the way they are, thankyouverymuch. IE; guys weird them out.

They can reproduce the normal way in their human forms with other races (although this is incredibly rare if not anathema, given their strained relations with anyone else; still, Hanon mentions that mermaid nations have a streamlined age of consent, and considering that some of them are straight and nobody sees anything wrong with that...
<ul><li> The more usual way is by having their pearl placed in a giant magic shell when they die to create a successor.

</li><li> The Guardians of the Universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> comics were all male, because the females of their race thought the whole "guardians of the universe" project was misguided, and took themselves off to found an all-female society somewhere else. (They were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>, and practically immortal, so the continuation of their race was not a consideration.)

When she describes the fact that it's possible to procreate with a female like her, the young man who acts as her translator is eager to try it (and she's fairly receptive, too). Unfortunately, the way the beings of this species procreate is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotSymbolic">stabbing a giant snail-like creature in a special purple membrane</a>, which causes babies of the tribe's species to bud off the snail (and also increases the numbers of the snails). The young man then brags to one of his elders that he's finally become strong enough to perform the ritual, the proof being outside his hut: a spear covered in red gore, as opposed to the purplish ichor of the snails.

</li><li> The Hutts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> are hermaphroditic, but as a cultural thing, they alternate gender terminology between the periods when they are capable of reproduction and when they are not (as a result, we could consider them an entire <em>genderfluid</em> race). At least, that was the case in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a>/Legends</em> continuity. The new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> has made them dual sexed again, without the gender switching.

Since they only wanted the Lycans for physical labour, it makes sense they would only use male subjects, and as a secondary benefit, if there were no women the Lycans couldn't breed and this allowed the vampires to control their numbers. Oddly, in the few thousand years since the Lycans freed themselves, they never seemed to try turning a woman.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderworldBloodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderworldBloodWars">Blood Wars</a></em>, as several female Lycans can be seen in the background and fighting side by side with the males.

While the people are physically ordinary humans with two sexes, the Radchaai make very little distinction between them, with fashions, social opportunities, and everything else being equally applicable to both sexes. The Radchaai language doesn't even have pronouns to differentiate between them, with everyone defaulting to female, and their society is completely egalitarian with jobs determined by a standardized test called the Aptitudes that are taken sometime before adulthood. Breq often laments about the difficulty of having to decide which pronoun to use to keep from looking foolish and how relieving not having to worry about it is after returning to Radch space.
</li><li> The Hork-Bajir from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> are originally seen this way, the only (externally noticeable) difference being the females have one less facial horn than the males (The free Hork-Bajir who relates this says that there are other differences as well, but refuses to share them).
</li><li> The Khepri of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BasLagCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BasLagCycle">Bas-Lag Cycle</a> are a version of this trope. Males and females both exist, but only females are sentient. Females resemble a red-skinned human woman with a scarab beetle for a head; males are just the scarab and are essentially mindless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad">Belgariad</a></em>: Dryads are a female-only race that live as long as the tree to which they're bonded (sometimes hundreds or thousands of years). They reproduce by breeding with humans. Sons are human and sent to live in their father's world while daughters are dryad and raised by the dryads in the forest. The exception is the Tolnedran royal family. A dryad-human marriage means the royal males are human and the royal females are dryad, but the females remain in human society because one is destined by ancient treaty to become the wife of the Rivan King. It's strongly implied the original human-dryad marriage was a manipulation to ensure the Rivan King, who would have a sorcerer's unnatural lifespan, would be given a wife that was equal to him in both social status and lifespan, as such equalities in sorcerer marriages are very important to the gods.

R. R. Tolkien</a> eventually put a much-copied twist on this. Only about one female is born to every three males, and to untrained eyes, their women look very similar to men.

One day, a Dwarf is seen alone, and the next, there's a tiny bearded Dwarf on his back, swinging around a toy hammer.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Green" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Green">Green</a></em> downplays and justifies this trope to the point where it's reasonable. The majority of leprechauns are male, but there <em>are</em> females. This is because leprechauns are a very long-lived species and the gender-imbalance serves as population control by stopping them from having too many babies.
<div class="indent"><strong>Brownwyn:</strong> We leprechauns live a long time, Lil. A very long time, indeed, by human standards.

</div></li><li> In Greg Egan's novella <em>Oceanic</em>, whether you're born with a penis ('bridge') isn't important; each time you copulate, it detaches and re-attaches itself to the other partner. Married couples take turns bearing children. This race of humans was artificially created, apparently because members of the uploaded human societies that appear in various of Egan's other works (especially <em>Diaspora</em>) thought giving up the flesh had been bad for their souls.
<ul><li> Egan's novel <em>Schild's Ladder</em> has a somewhat similar setup. Pronouns still have gender, determined not by physical sex (which is temporary anyway) but by the traditional and arbitrary gender of the given name. Some people like to tease earlier-model humans who show up out of the deep past (thanks to relativistic time compression) by telling them fanciful stories about sex.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ambiguous case with the Veela. The Slavic fairies they're based on are all female, as are all the ones mentioned in the books.

For what it's worth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> does mention one part-veela male: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Louis, the eighth-veela son of Fleur and Bill</span>.
</li><li> Similarly, all centaurs seen in the books are male. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that yes, they are a one-gender race.
</li><li> Hags are also mentioned at various points, and seem to all be female.
</li><li> And all the goblins mentioned are male.
<ul><li> While there is no mention of female goblins in the books, the film of <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em> features a female goblin night-club singer.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em>Herland</em> by Charlotte Perkins Gilman sort of fits this trope, as the inhabitants of Herland are perfectly normal human women but can somehow reproduce asexually, with only girls born.
</li><li> The witches in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em> trilogy constitute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">a separate, entirely female species.</a> They breed with human men, but generally don't get too emotionally attached, since — compared to the witches — humans have such very, very <em>short</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies">lifespans</a>.

All 'Immortals'—species which cannot die of old age or disease, but <em>can</em> be killed by physical or magical means—are born in the Divine Realms as the product of human dreams or nightmares. One such species, the Tauros, is essentially a race of minotaurs who exist to rape and kill women. Daine, the protagonist of the story, asks the god of the 'duckmoles' (platypuses), if there even <em>are</em> any female Tauroses. When he says no, she gets angry and basically says 'well no wonder they attack human women all the time! That's all they know to do without women of their own who can handle it!' Broadfoot, the duckmole, muses that she's right, and 'Someone should consult the Greater Gods about this...' Later works reveal that the Greater Gods did examine it and found the trope was enforced: because Tauroses are born out of women's fear of rape, they will continue to exist as long as rape does and can only target human women.

Males are never seen, and other races learn not to ask about them, because it offends the otherwise good-natured Chirps.

They can interbreed with male humans, losing their "family quirk", and they think of themselves as humans. Or at least they did until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of them tried to give birth to a Vulcan son and almost succeeded.</span>
</li><li> The koloss from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn">Mistborn</a></em> trilogy are all male, though this is because they are an unnatural race and do not reproduce by normal means. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Instead, they're created by binding five people together with a special skin and four hemalurgic spikes.

The child of a koloss is a "koloss-blooded," stronger and tougher than ordinary humans. Once they come of age, they can then choose to make the transformation into a full koloss or leave the clan. Ordinary humans can also choose to join the clan and make the transformation; no distinction is made from a koloss who was originally an ordinary human and one who was koloss-blooded.

They also have no intention of allowing the men to disrupt their way of life, and aren't going to keep them prisoner; much more humane to simply kill them.</span> It was Tiptree, what do you want?
</li><li> Part of Joanna Russ's novel <em>The Female Man</em> is set on "Whileaway", a utopian alternate future Earth where the entire male population was killed off by a plague generations earlier, though it's implied in a couple places that the men may have in fact been killed off by the women in a world wide war of the sexes. She explores what the ramifications of a single-sex society might actually be (well, when she's not in the middle of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Author Filibuster</a> about how women are oppressed): on Whileaway, for instance, the greatest sexual taboo is cross-generation, getting involved with someone old enough to be your parent or your child.

It's probably justified in that the original Uleb were an "artificial" species, intended to replace the extant "warrior" species of M 87's galactic caste system with a genetically engineered new and improved super soldier version.

How they reproduce is never stated, but in <em>Nightlife</em> Darkling refers to Robin as a "Mitotic shithead." Also, Pucks are referred to in several places as goats, or mutated goats, or something else about goats. Which leads one to wonder about the origin of the Puck species.
</li><li> The process is elaborated upon in <em>Doubletake</em>. Every thousand years or so all the Pucks meet up, count how many remain and generally catch up before, naturally, engaging in an orgy with the only creatures not terrified of that many Pucks in one place. They then choose a number of Pucks by lot and order them to reproduce, which consists of somehow generating a clone completely identical to themselves, including all memory and experience. The cloning is strictly mandated, a death sentence the alternative.

The alien impact this has on a biologically male outside observer is a major part of the plot.
</li><li> The short story "The Matter of Seggri" dealt with a planet where males are a rarity, with something like 12 females for every one male. The story subverts this somewhat by being specifically about the anthropological ramifications of having a species like that, and how it affects the planet. It is written like a study.

In the final season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Howlyn</a> asks Zo'or how "he" would handle becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Atavus</a> (the original species, from which the Taelons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReptilians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReptilians">Jaridians</a> were created), a two-gender race. Naturally, given who plays Zo'or, the Taelon ends up becoming a female Atavus. It's never made clear how the Taelons came to be this trope. The original Taelons were cultists, who drained the rest of the Atavus of their core energy to make themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>, turning the rest into the short-lived Jaridians. They were flawed creations and nearly died out, until the Kimera came and corrected their genome (the Taelons thanked them by wiping them out).

Weirdly, though they are also cloned, the Vorta are <em>not</em> single-gender. Probably because the Vorta were adapted from a pre-existing species, while the Jem'Hadar seem to have been created out of whole cloth (it might also have something to do with the Vorta being intended as diplomats).

This has inspired many of the other examples on this page. In late Classical works there were female centaurs and satyrs, but these are unusual cases; kentaurides (the female centaurs) were barely spoken of in ancient Greek literature and only one example, Hylonome, is mentioned by name, while the satyresses (the female satyrs) are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">Canon Immigrants</a> from late 15th/early 16th century poems and art, and didn't exist at all in the ancient works.
<ul><li> Originally satyrs were depicted as human men with beards, bald foreheads, pug noses, pointed ears, horses tails, and constant erections. Technically, only the tails and ears set them apart from standard image of a 'wild man'.
</li><li> The original Greek depiction of the very human Amazon civilization variably implied they replenished their numbers the way most warrior cultures did, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove">invading villages</a>.

<ul><li> All-male satyrs mate with all-female dryads, and all-male fauns mate with all-female nymphs.

</li><li> The all-female race of hags. Hags mate with male humans (and typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">subsequently kill and eat them</a>) to either produce a female hag or a male hagspawn which have almost none of the magical abilities of their mothers, and Hags in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> give birth to all-female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangelingTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangelingTale">changelings</a>, who must be persuaded, tricked or coerced into undergoing a magical ritual to become hags in turn. Well, to be accurate, they have male offspring as well, but A: very rarely, and B: they kill them on birth.
</li><li> D&amp;D medusas (based on gorgons) <em>aren't</em> this; male medusas are called maedars, and are bald humanoids with an affinity for snakes and an intristic <em>stone to flesh</em> ability. They're also extremely rare. In 4th edition, male medusa are just called that, look just like masculine counterparts to the medusa (still bald, though) and have traded the stone-to-flesh-by-touch power for a gaze attack lifted straight from the mythological basilisk. That is, if they look at you, their gaze is so venomous you die of poisoning if you meet their eye. This is the same edition that states there are male harpies, whereas the previous editions meandered between implying that harpies kidnapped human men to breed with and that they laid eggs parthenogenically. In 5th Edition there are no maedars; male medusae are exactly like the female ones.
</li><li> There are four species of sphinx; three of which are always male (evil hawk-headed heirocosphinxes, neutral but brutish ram-headed criosphinxes, and good human-headed androsphinxes) and one of which is always female (neutral human-headed gynosphinxes - they're the ones who like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddlingSphinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddlingSphinx">riddles</a>). All three male sphinxes can mate with the gynosphinx and have offspring of their own type, but gynosphinxes can only be born of an androsphinx father. For this reason, and the temperament, gynosphinxes prefer androsphinxes.
</li><li> In 2nd Edition AD&amp;D, the standard version of the minotaur was an all-male race. New minotaurs came into being when a human male was cursed to become one by the gods, or when a minotaur abducted and impregnated a human woman. Note that this only applied to the "default" version, and minotaurs from specific game-settings such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a> did come in two genders.

<ul><li> The modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan">Ahrimanes</a> are all-female by choice, as the one Ahrimane who can create more of her kind isn't interested in changing men. Male Ahrimanes are possible in <em>V20 Dark Ages</em>, but they and their creator find themselves being hunted down. Trans women are accepted, as the Ahrimanes judge by spirit rather than body.

</li><li> Theoretically all Tyranids are this, as there is no documentation on exactly how they "reproduce" (The Norn Queens require biomass to create new creatures but doesn't seem to need anything resembling a male to actually spawn them). Things get weird when you realize that, due to their symbiotic weapons, they <em>all</em> technically qualify as females as their weapons spawn and gestate eggs, then spew them out via a muscle spasm.
</li><li> Chaos Daemons, aside those of Slaanesh, are generally mono-gendered due to the fact that they're fragment representations of their respective Chaos Gods. This is because rather than being born biologically, they're created via other methods (Khornate and Tzeentchan Daemons are usually created by actions of their respective gods, while Plaguebearers are spawned from the departed souls of people who die from Nurgle's plagues). Slaanesh is a special case because he/she/it and all of his/her/it's daemons tend to switch pronouns depending on who you ask (Eldar exclusively refer to Slaaneshi daemons with female pronouns) and technically Slaanesh is a hermaphrodite.
</li><li> The Lizardmen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> are all males; they are born from spawning pools throughout Lustria, and were initially created by the Old Ones. Their war with the Skaven began when the Skaven poisoned one city's spawning pools.
<ul><li> Actually, since the Lizardmen don't reproduce sexually, it is more correct to say they are genderless. Though male pronouns are generally used if necessary. The Skaven, while apparently all male, do have females - it's just that their extreme sexual dimorphism means those females are giant, barely sentient breeding machines confined to their burrows.

Justified in that Matoran gender differences are psychological only, and it is unlikely that they could reproduce sexually, as it has been said that Matoran were created by the great beings.
<ul><li> The element of psionics is an interesting case. The first Toa of psionics was male, and fucked up horribly in the task assigned to him (he was suppose to pacify the Zyglaks, but threw a temper-tantrum so hard the Zyglaks are now known to be the <em>most vicious animals in the universe</em>), so the great beings decided to make every Toa of psionics after him female.

This has an in-game justification of the females of certain races being deliberately sheltered and do not go adventuring. The real reason was technical; there was not enough room on one CD for all the sprites required to have females for all the races.
</li><li> In <em>A Hint of a Tint</em> all of the species who inhabit the Sanctuary are all-female. Breeding is accomplished with the use of male "Tailless" (i.e., humans), who inevitably die after several days due to their inability to drink the local water.
</li><li> The Kaka clan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em> are at least close to being a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">genetically engineered</span> one-gender race that reproduce via parthenogenesis. Kaka males are mentioned as being incredibly rare, and none are seen in game.
</li><li> <em>Breeding Season</em> (an H game) treats all monster species as this, to the point that, for example, male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Cat Folk</a> or female werewolves are considered mutant strains. The sole exceptions are elves and humans (elves coming in male or female versions, and humans being NPC's).
</li><li> Only male Grendels and either male (in <em>2</em>) or female (in <em>3</em>) Ettins occur without player intervention (or breeding, once you have both genders) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Creatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Creatures">Creatures</a></em> games.

Since the "monster" classes are all gender-specific, as well, but monsters are, through Mediators, capable of marrying and even producing offspring, it's safe to assume that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualsBreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualsBreed">Gender Equals Breed</a>.
</li><li> The Kremlings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em> were like this for a long time, with only males depicted (there is a throwaway reference to a wife for K.

It took them until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongBarrelBlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongBarrelBlast">Donkey Kong Barrel Blast</a></em> to finally introduce female Kremlings to the series.

<ul><li> This was widely believed of the Qunari in-universe until envoys came to Seheron. Only male qunari fight as soldiers, and soldiers were the only qunari seen until a peace was struck. No female qunari had been seen prior to <em>Inquisition.</em>
</li><li> The descendants of Andraste, the game's chief human deity, a Jesus/Mary/Mohammad/Joan of Arc analog. She had two daughters with her mortal husband. Andraste's older daughter had one child, but that granddaughter died childless. Andraste's younger daughter had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings">large number of children</a>. However, they were all girls, and <em>they</em> only had girls, and so on. But since these women married into other families, and because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">the Second Blight</a> destroyed so many records, historians lost track of them through the ages. This means no one knows who the present-day Descendants of Andraste are, only that they're all women.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiegeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiegeII">Dungeon Siege II</a></em> has the Dryads. Quoted from page 40 of the manual, "These creatures resembled Human females in many ways. (If there are male Dryads, they keep themselves well-hidden. None has ever been seen." Also, "No one knows how they reproduce (any enquiries on the subject are met with hostile silence)".
<ul><li> Half Giants are all male, though they can procreate with other races. A quest explains that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they originated when a group of Agallan giants betrayed their kin and for this they and their offspring were cursed to be small. There were no women among the traitors, so all Half-Giants are male.</span>

<ul><li> The Dremora, a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">lesser Daedra</a>, are mistakenly believed to be the case by both mortals in-universe and players. There are rare female Dremora in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>, but seeing as they only appear in one caste and don't have spoken lines, this was probably a mistake. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">Online</a></em> properly introduces female Dremora and gives them some characterization. (Dremora have a male dominated society and strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> attitudes, believing females to be inferior in war, with females only serving in combat roles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuysSmashGirlsShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuysSmashGirlsShoot">support troop mages or skirmishers</a>.)
</li><li> Golden Saints (Aureal) and Dark Seducers (Mazken), two other forms of lesser Daedra in service to Sheogorath (Daedric Prince of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Madness</a>), are almost entirely female. (There are more male Golden Saints and Dark Seducers than there are female Dremora.)
</li><li> Winged Twilights are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatOutOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatOutOfHell">bat-like</a> form of lesser Daedra with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpingOnAboutHarpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpingOnAboutHarpies">harpy-like</a> traits. All Winged Twilights encountered by mortals to date have been female.
</li><li> Similar to the lesser Daedra above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">dragons</a>, a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonsAreDivine">divine</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Aedric</a> entity, are not known to have sexes nor reproduce. All known dragons have spoken with male voices, however.
</li><li> Most denizens of Tamriel believe this to be the case for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreDifferent">Giants</a>, but they actually subvert it. There <em>are</em> female Giants, but they are very rarely ever seen by outsiders, leading many to mistakenly believe that this is the case for the Giants.
</li><li> Likewise, most denizens of Tamriel believe this to be the case for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull">Minotaurs</a>. Like Giants, it is actually subverted. Female Minotaurs do exist, but they are just so rarely seen by outsiders that most believe all Minotaurs to be male.
</li><li> This is played straight by Hagravens, a species of flightless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpingOnAboutHarpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpingOnAboutHarpies">harpy</a> who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">once mortal women</a> who traded their humanity for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">access to powerful magic</a>. All known Hagravens have been female, but they get around any reproductive issues since Hagravens aren't born, but are created by transforming mortal women.
</li><li> Nymphs, a type of nature spirit, also play this straight. All known Nymphs take the form of beautiful, naked women.
</li><li> Similarly, Spriggans are another type of nature spirit who take the forms of humanoid female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">tree-like</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople">Plant People</a>. All known Spriggans have taken a humanoid female form, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries">a noticeable bust</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverOasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverOasis">Ever Oasis</a></em> has two: The Drauk are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAmazon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAmazon">all-female</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizard Folk</a>, and the Serkah are a laid-back mining race of <em>scorpion</em> men. The Drauk being lizards makes sense given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> all-female lizard species.
</li><li> One researcher in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuestII">EverQuest II</a></em> spent his life carefully studying Orcs, lampshading the fact that female orcs are never seen. He theorizes that they are either indistinguishable from any other orcs, or are so rare that they're only used for breeding and never see the light of day.
</li><li> Also in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> franchise, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">various incarnations</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">of Ivalice</a> (aside from the all-human original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>) feature the Gria. Except for humans, most other races are effectively all-male, as well, but it appears simply because they have no alternate gender appearance, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em> has a Luck Stick vendor and exchanger who are described in-game as male and female, respectively, in spite of appearing completely identical. The Seeq have an official female sprite, though it's just a Seeq Viking with a pink outfit and lipstick, and not playable.
<ul><li> Officially there are male Viera, though none have appeared in any games. According to canon sources, they live separate from the female half of the species and the two populations only meet when it's babymaking time. A young, spoiled Viera appears in a series of missions in TA2, and wants the player to help her capture a Wyrm so that she can take it home and impress her father. So far, Gria have only appeared in one game of the Ivalice series, and their role was tertiary at best, so no word yet on how their society functions.
</li><li> Tactics A2 plays with your expectations a little, with the Duelhorn Boss, Night Dancer. From first appearances you might think she's the only female Bangaa character and therefore is safe for your Viera unit to hit under the "No Harming Opposite Gender" law. But no, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">got a pickle surprise.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> introduces the Garif. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart">like the Viera</a>, all of the ones that you meet are a single gender, though in this case they're all males. Also like the Viera, canon sources outside the game state that the two genders live separately.
</li></ul></li><li> Mithra and Galka in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em>:
<ul><li> Galka are male-only, and "reproduce" by reincarnation. It is suggested that the number of Galka in the world is either fixed or slowly decreasing due to premature death.
</li><li> Players can only choose to play female Mithra, with the excuse that the number of male Mithra is so critically low that they have been forced into protective status while the females are the ones that venture outside their homeland to adventure and hunt. It is not exactly an enviable position as most males are forced into passionless sex for reproductive purposes, but a few certain males with intelligence and loose morals (like Lehko Habhoka) use their rarity to gain power and status.
</li><li> Later, an all-female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">enemy race</a> called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople">Lamia</a> was added to the game, though their status as one may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the insinuation that they're actually an artificial race used as biological weapons...and because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreDifferent">mythical creatures</a> they're based on are always depicted as female.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> had races based on <em>XI</em>'s, so like the Galka and Mithra, the Roegadyn were only male and Miqo'te only female. The opposite sexes of the races <em>did</em> exist; a prominent NPC, Merlwyb, was a female Roegadyn. However, as of <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, both males and females of all races are playable.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople">Ananta</a> are an all-female beast tribe introduced in <em>Stormblood</em> who are able to reproduce without the need of males, which they consider to be a blessing from their goddess Lakshmi.
</li><li> The <em>Shadowbringers</em> expansion includes two playable monogender races: the all-female Viera from <em>FFXII</em> (which also downplays this trope, since lore establishes that there are males who never leave the homeland), and the all-male Hrothgar, a race of burly men who have furry characteristics that make them like like anthropmorphic big cats. Similar to the male Mithra lore, it's stated that female Hrothgar are incredibly low in numbers and are kept in their homeland to help populate their race.
</li></ul></li><li> Possibly the silliest example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GenderWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GenderWars">Gender Wars</a></em>, in which humanity has separated along gender lines into two warring factions of exaggerated stereotypes, both of which reproduce through technology, along with stealing <em>required genetic materials</em> from the other side.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> contains two races that fit this category as of the Eye of the North expansion: Dwarves and Charr. In the case of the latter, it has been explained why this is the case, and in the case of the former it is lampshaded by one of the dwarf character's random lines.
<ul><li> 'How do you know you've never seen a female dwarf? Eh? Eh?'
</li><li> Similarly, the Harpies appear to be this, as all 3 humanoid forms are female, and while never directly explained it's implied the griffins that accompany them could possibly be their males.
</li><li> It's worth noting that female charr do exist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> as playable and non-playable characters, so this is only true of the original game. Background fluff explains the Flame Legion which controlled the Charr during the first game had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">traditional views on gender roles</a>, which carries over to their faction's behavior in the sequel.
</li></ul></li><li> The playable cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection">Kantai Collection</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToukenRanbu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToukenRanbu">Touken Ranbu</a></em>. The former consists of female personifications of battleships and the latter male personifications of Japanese swords.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Gerudo are an entirely female human race of warrior-thieves. In fact, the Gerudo often leave the desert and visit Hyrule for the purpose of finding a man to borrow (or even marry) in order to make more little Gerudo. Though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em> states that one Gerudo male is born every hundred years and appointed king by tradition (the only one known is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ganondorf</a>), the <em>Creating a Champion</em> artbook states that by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, a male has not been born to the Gerudo for countless millennia.
</li><li> Gorons all identify as male, referring to each other as "Brother." This could be the case of identity rather than biological sex or they could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent">Truly Single Parents</a>, since all cases of child Gorons seen in the series only have fathers and mothers are never mentioned. The manga of <em>Ocarina of Time</em> has a few female Gorons that are only visibly different due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TertiarySexualCharacteristics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TertiarySexualCharacteristics">long eyelashes</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em> references this ambiguity by showing that two Goron men have been allowed in the women-only Gerudo Town, and absolutely no one knows why this is, least of all the Gorons. A throwaway line in the Japanese version implies that the Gerudo consider the Gorons honorary women.
</li><li> All of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleMen">Mogmas</a> seen in the race's sole appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em> are male.
</li></ul></li><li> No female dwarves exist anywhere in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em>. Not even the player can become one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> The asari are a literal one-gender race, who reproduce through parthenogenesis. Of course, they're also among the wisest and most ancient races in the galaxy, powerful users of biotic techniques, and the founders of the Citadel Council, which governs 80% of known space. But the player is likely to be more interested in their ability to 'merge' with anyone, regardless of race and gender. The asari even have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Self-Racism</a> against asari who join with other asari. Partly because the race feels that nothing new is gained from merging with other asari, and partly because only "pureblooded" asari can be born with a genetic birth defect that turns them into deadly sex vampires.
</li><li> There isn't as much focus on it, but most of the other non-human races are functionally one-gendered races as well, at least in the first two games. That is, females are either implied or stated to exist, but are never seen due to lack of an in-game model. A female krogan (just one) and a female turian are finally seen in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. There are also two female salarians (one if you saved the Council in <em>Mass Effect</em>), but they look identical to the males. It's stated in the Codex that salarians have far fewer females than males and as a result of this most females stay on their homeworld and major colony worlds to stay safe and make sure the species can still reproduce. Female krogan and turians become much more common in <em>Andromeda</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> There is no gender in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>. Any two individuals of a species can reproduce together, and in some races all members have female traits (all chickens lay eggs and all cows give milk).
</li><li> In <em>Monster Girl Quest</em>, all the monsters are female, and survive by raping human males. Early on, we find out that this isn't their fault: The humans' goddess has forbidden sexual intercourse with monsters. Again, they're all female, so it's just a slow form of genocide.
<ul><li> This goes deeper than genetics to the spiritual "essence of monsterhood"; even artificial and spontaneously generated species are all female, and the rare male children of monsters are genetically human. This eventually gets explained: the goddess who created the first monsters wanted to force some degree of coexistence with humanity as a way of balancing the energies maintaining creation. At other time periods it's worked out.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>, where it's understood the differences between males and females are just too subtle to notice. There are a few interesting cases, though. Rathalos and Rathian are respectively males and females of the same species, but dimorphic enough to warrant separate names. Teostra and Lunastra are similar. There are some Elder Dragons that play the tropes straight, but these are an enigma in many other ways besides.

Elves are just plain all female, with no male counterpart. They're not actually stated to be all male or all female, but those are the only options available to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a>, and we don't see any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> contrary to this pattern, either.

It is explained that when a dwarf dies, they crumble into a pile of pebbles which are then used to make more dwarves. Also, the Vennen (a race of spider people) are all male and reproduce by capturing other races, (especially their sworn enemies the Orcs) tying them up in giant spiderwebs, and using them as incubation slaves.

</li><li> While most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Legendary Pokémon</a> are genderless, a few of them do have gender. Latios and Latias are one of the first of those Legendary Pokémon with a gender, though Latios is always male while Latias is always female as they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism">implied to be members of the same "species"</a>.

All the Redflanks that appear in the game are males and all the Sky-people females, but in the case of the Redflanks it's mentioned by Grunzford that the Redflank females died out awhile ago, which is why there are fewer and fewer Redflank as time goes on, as well as why the current population always appears to be older.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>: Because Cryptic never bothered to design female Gorn, Letheans, or Nausicaans, they're one-gendered from a gameplay standpoint. This is a rather major pet peeve for the KDF fanbase. A later expansion added playable Jem'hadar, which are one-gendered even in-universe.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TitanQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TitanQuest">Titan Quest</a></em>, all the various races of beastmen and demons are monogendered. The only possible exception is given by the always masked Dune Raiders: one of their heroes has a feminine name, though she's otherwise identical to the male ones.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em>'s campaign, the Night Elves begin as a one-gender race, until the male Druids, who have apparently been hibernating for a long, long time, awaken.
<ul><li> Even in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, there are many more female Night Elves than male. This is probably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSexy">Rule of Sexy</a> choice by Blizzard and the players, and the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a>) reason for this is probably that many males are still trapped within the Emerald Dream. If players are ever allowed to visit the Emerald Dream, one can bet that there will be plenty of male Night Elves running around.
</li></ul></li><li> The Chua of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wildstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wildstar">Wildstar</a></em> are the only race without any gender options. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the Chua do indeed have two genders but both look identical either way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Oracles, Murlocs, and Kobolds seem rather one-gendery.... though they maybe don't have any sexual dimorphism at all. Furbolgs are a good example of this. The one female furbolg seen looks exactly like every other furbolg out there.
</li><li> Several races have both genders according to the lore, but only one (male, with an exception being the succubus) is depicted in game. Ogres, Broken and Lost Ones, for example...although a half-finished female Broken model exists in the game source. Literally <em>half</em>-finished. If the macro system's UnitSex() function is to believed, some of the 'all male races' such as Ogres do have female individuals in the game. Apparently the player characters just can't tell the difference.
</li><li> The Warcraft D20 monster manual states explicitly that Harpies reproduce by raping a captured humanoid race, preferring elves and humans.
</li><li> The above quote is about the mogu, which had women at one point, but after their return to stone bodies and resulting lack of need for sexual reproduction, different sexes have been effectively outmoded and now all mogu appear "male". Lei Shen's Twin Consorts are rumored to be the only female-looking mogu in modern existence, and they suffer from the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeGuyTinyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeGuyTinyGirl">Huge Guy, Tiny Girl</a> syndrome as draenei, as a result of being literally built based on Lei Shen's personal specifications.
</li><li> The Tol'vir initially appeared to be an example of this trope but a "priestess" appeared in the "Visions of N'Zoth" patch and proved to be physically indistinguishable from the males. Presumably the same holds true for other females.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> series the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Teladi</a> <em>do</em> have males, but they nearly all still live on the homeworld because the species discovered early in their space age that unfertilized eggs would always hatch females, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">homeworld was cut off</a> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">Portal Network</a> for 600 years. Even someone who deals with Teladi regularly will likely never meet a male, so this trope is the public perception.

<ul><li> The Definians are an all-female species that feature a lot of cybernetics and serve as spies for the Ganglion coalition. They rely on cloning to reproduce.
</li><li> The Orpheans are all referred to as males despite having no concept of gender, and since they reproduce asexually, it's made clear there are no females... at first. A spontaneous mutation on Mira suddenly causes female Orpheans to start appearing, which confuses the hell out of the entire species.

If there are female Ogres, for example, they are never on screen. Troggles (Lady Bane's dog-like minions) were apparently male, yet during the Wedding Episode in which she and Toady were going to marry (due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potion</a>), Troggles are shown in striper outfit dancing for the Ogres, so they probably are all female.
</li><li> All of the talking anthropomorphic dogs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> appear to be male.
<ul><li> And can even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> interbreed with human women, which oddly enough, can result in fully-human offspring.</span>
</li><li> However, after sixteen seasons, this is finally subverted in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS16E10BoyDogMeetsGirlDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS16E10BoyDogMeetsGirlDog">Boy (Dog) Meets Girl (Dog)</a>", where Ellie is introduced as the first female talking dog.

The other men died from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutWithABang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutWithABang">crushed pelvises from Snu-Snu</a>.
</li><li> The Gnomes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> are all male, at least in their first appearance. They apparently are supposed to have a single female "queen" which the entire tribe is married to and is presumably the mother of the younger generation, as father-son pairs of gnomes exist, but this seems to usually be a kidnapped human woman or girl. However, a single gnome that appears to be female briefly appears (with no dialogue or plot significance) in "The Last Mabelcorn".
</li><li> Subverted with the Irkens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>. They appear to be a race of generic ant-like aliens, but there are a few with distinctly feminine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TertiarySexualCharacteristics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TertiarySexualCharacteristics">Tertiary Sexual Characteristics</a> (long eyelashes, curly antennae). The Irken's actual existence and sentience is tied to their PAK so presumably the meat-puppet they decide to use for a body is their choice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> actually made <em>more</em> sense without the "big brother ponies," when the ponies appeared to be a one-gender race that reproduces via parthenogenesis, resulting in babies physically identical to their mothers. Instead, this seems to be only the case for unicorns and pegasi, as all the males seen in that episode are Earth ponies.
<ul><li> According to one of the comics, little ponies reproduce by looking in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror">Magic Mirror</a> and wishing for a baby, hence the identical babies. The real question is, where did the babies without an adult counterpart come from? The "old way," maybe?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyG3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyG3">My Little Pony (G3)</a> </em>, with the exception of Twinkle Wish Adventure, the ponies are all female. It is even unknown how the G3 ponies would reproduce since there was no mention of it in the films. The only male character in the films was, of course, Spike the Dragon himself.
</li><li> Not surprisingly, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> (who watched the older cartoons growing up) came on board for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, she promptly made sure to avert this trope - Equestrian ponies come in both genders and reproduce the way Earth mammals do, no ifs, ands, or magic mirrors.

Smurfs appear to reproduce by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliveryStork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliveryStork">stork</a>:

</li><li> Sassette was made by the three male smurflings <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(themselves originally adults)</span> wanting to make a companion for Smurfette after she complained about being 'the only girl'.

The droid is pink, but the series consistently averted the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMeansFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMeansFeminine">Pink Means Feminine</a> rule. If the droid isn't female, then all robots in this cartoon are male.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a>:</em> Gems have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">No Biological Sex</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction">reproduce asexually with machines</a>, though all of them appear female and use "she/her" pronouns. The only exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Steven</a>, who's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a>. The show's supervising director Ian JQ went so far as to confirm this in a Tumblr post by <em>specifically</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://ianjq.tumblr.com/post/113794156834/i-know-that-the-gems-are-sexless-agendered-etc">linking to this TV Tropes page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as a reference, citing the Namekians from <em>Dragon Ball</em> as another example. Creator Rebecca Sugar has stated that Gems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanNonBinary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanNonBinary">don't have a gender binary and are more or less genderless from their own perspective</a>, but pretty much roll with being identified as female because they don't really mind or care. As the series has gone on, some of the types gem types introduced are almost or completely androgynous, and a very small number of them even have male voice actors (Snowflake Obsidian and one of the Pebbles, along with one of Steven's fusion).
</li><li> The rolling stock from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em>. Passenger cars such as Annie and Clarabel, Henrietta, and Old Slow Coach are always female, while freight cars such as the Troublesome Trucks, the Spiteful Brakevan, Hector the hopper car, and Rocky the repair crane are always male.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>. The Galra initially appear to be an all-male race, but as time goes on more female Galra pop up, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with one of them even being the mother of one of the main characters</span>.
</li><li> While not a concrete example, female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transformers">Transformers</a> are exceedingly rare. In fact, in some continuities, they don't exist at all. Why a mechanical race even has genders is a frequently-debated topic, as are... how to put this delicately?... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashFic">other questions related to gender functions</a>.
<ul><li> In the Generation One cartoon, the Transformers were built as civilian and military hardware by the Quintessons for sale to other species. Though the Quints themselves are a one-gender race, they know and understand genders and built their products to appeal to their clients. Another thing to note is that for the longest time there were only female Autobots, the civilian line. Female Decepticons (the military line) were unheard of, and we only began seeing female villains in the sequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> (Blackarachnia) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em> (Strika). Both of whom might have been Autobots or their descendants: Blackarachnia was a reprogrammed Maximal (Autobot descendant), and Strika is a revived spark, of unknown original side.
</li><li> The idea of Transformers being a genderless race seems to have been thrown for a loop by the new <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Aligned_continuity_family">Aligned<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> continuity introduced by Hasbro; in which, one of the <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Thirteen_original_Transformers">Thirteen Original Transformers,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Solus Prime, is explicitly revealed to have been female (and thus the first female of their race).
</li></ul></li><li> The Pixies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> are a female-only race. They don't need males since they are created by a magical tree in their village. Amore (the pixie of love) got really sad when this was pointed out to her by Jolly. Digit actually makes a few references to male relatives, but no male pixies are ever seen in the show. To make things more confusing, Livy and Jolly are said to be cousins, which makes no sense if pixies just come into existence.
<ul><li> This is made more confusing by the presence of male pixies in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a>, though it's a different canon. It is also heavily implied that they reproduce...the old-fashioned way...since pixies are shown to have families, including parents, though it also possible that they are only structured into families.
</li><li> Male fairies are never seen or mentioned, indicating that they can't be fairies. Although, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>, some male background characters are shown to be able to cast spells in the first season.
<ul><li> It is implied that paladins serve as some male equivalent to the fairies, especially Paladium (who even had wings), but this is never fully confirmed. Likewise, wizards (such as Valtor and the Wizards of the Black Circle) are heavily implied to serve as a male equivalent to witches, but this is also never explained.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Aphids reproduce mainly by parthenogenesis, and they are indeed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/911/are-aphids-born-pregnant">born pregnant.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Some aphids do have males and sexually reproducing females at certain times, such as in the fall, so that they can produce eggs that can survive through the winter, but for the most part aphids are a one-gender race.
</li><li> The barramundi is a species of fish where all start as male and slowly change to female throughout their lifecycle (resulting in the vast, vast majority of large fish being female).
<ul><li> The clown fish essentially does the opposite. Fish are either sexually immature males, mature males or females with one mature male and one female living in a given population of clown fish. When a female dies, the mature male becomes the female and an immature male becomes the mature male. This means that by the time Nemo met his father in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FindingNemo">Finding Nemo</a>, he would have actually been his mother.
</li></ul></li><li> Bdelloids. They are all female and lay fully fertilized eggs.
</li><li> The Brahminy blind snake is the only all-female snake species, reproducing by parthenogenesis. It's also known as the flowerpot snake as it has been accidentally introduced to many areas where it's not native in the soil of imported plants. Being parthenogenetic means it's quickly able to establish itself in new places.
</li><li> Female stick insects reproduce asexually. Though males do exist in some species, they are extremely rare.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmorkrebs">Marmorkrebs,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or marbled crayfish, is an all-female crayfish that reproduces through parthenogenesis. It is a captive, mutated form of the slough crayfish, <em>Procambarus fallax</em>. The slough crayfish is an aversion, since it has both males and females.
</li><li> <em>Mycocepurus smithii</em>, a species of ant, is entirely female, reproducing asexually.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> with the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flabby_whalefish">Flabby Whalefish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The males, females, and juveniles were once though to be separate species (Big Nose, Flabby Whalefish, and Tape Tails respectively)</span>.
</li><li> Snails, slugs and worms are all hermaphrodites; they do mate with others in order to reproduce but only one of the two can lay eggs.
</li><li> Some species of rotifers are apparently 100% female, though it's possible that the males (which tend to be a lot smaller) just haven't been seen yet. Even rotifers that are capable of producing male offspring usually do so only if the puddle they're living in starts to freeze or dry up, as mating with males allows them to produce durable eggs that can endure harsh conditions. When conditions are good, rotifer populations go all-female, and the thin-shelled parthenogenetic eggs they lay contain clones of themselves.
</li><li> Subverted with hyenas. Medieval scholars thought spotted hyenas were all male and reproduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomosexualReproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomosexualReproduction">homosexually</a>. This probably happened because females have enlarged clitorises that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLooksLikeADude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLooksLikeADude">look like penises</a> before they give birth for the first time.
</li><li> The Teiidae family of whiptail lizards includes many species that are either all-female or nearly so. This is made due to parthenogenesis induced by sexual stimulation. Yep, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot">hot girl on girl action</a> producing babies. How wicked can nature <em>not</em> be?
<ul><li> There are also lizard species that require sperm to reproduce, so they seduce males of other species.
</li></ul></li><li> There are some species of fish, such as the Amazon Molly Fish, that are only female, reproducing solely with the males of another certain species (one which has both males and females). These species work this way because either the act or the presence of sperm will stimulate egg production. Genetically, the offspring are the mother's.
</li><li> There is a <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018022453/http://eobasileus.blogspot.com/2008/03/male-chauvinist-minnows-form-all-male.html">species of all male fish.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Tortoiseshell and calico cats are almost exclusively female, due to the requirement of two X chromosomes to make the orange and black coat combo. While males do exist, they are very rare, usually sterile, and are either chimeras (result of two eggs fusing together) or XXY males.
</li><li> Triggerfish. Males are never born. Instead the biggest, baddest, strongest female undergoes a sex change to male.
</li><li> While anglerfish have both males and females, in some species the males attach to females and fuse with them until the male is little more than a lump of flesh on the female used to fertilize eggs.
</li><li> While there are female bees and male bees (drones), as a general rule the bees you'll see are female. Only the queen reproduces in a beehive, and she can choose whether to make sterile female workers (diploid), another queen (diploid individuals fed royal jelly for thirty days), or a drone. Drones are haploid, meaning they were not fertilized, and their sole purpose is to mate with the queen to give her a lifetime's supply of sperm. Once they mate, they are cast out of the hive and die, or die thanks to their genitals being ripped out of them after intercourse.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolbachia">wolbachia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> bacteria (right now confined to arthropods) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide">kills all mature males</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">turns all other males female</a> and allows females to have virgin births. Many species now have it incorporated into their sex-determination system pretty much permanently.
