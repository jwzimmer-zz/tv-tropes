<p>This is the scale which tries to encapsulate how abusive and not-so-abusive parents' behaviors towards their children are judged by writers. As some authors like to remind you that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">a single bad day makes you evil</a> and some others <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffParenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffParenting">think that teenagers from 13 and up should be left to fend for themselves</a>, this can create serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>.
</p><p>The usual examples of said dissonance usually consist of this: mothers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">tend to be portrayed more sympathetically</a> than fathers (unless they have a career); the protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">will usually</a> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">an excuse</a> or be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">forgiven for</a> the neglect that befalls their children; a dad or a mom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">has a much smaller chance</a> to be seen as a villain; the dad who left the mom and the child fending for themselves and died a hero in the war becomes much more beloved than the mother who tries to prevent the child from staying up too late; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffParenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffParenting">neglectful parents</a> who let their children do whatever they want with no ill consequences are usually more popular with a young fandom than a rightly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Overprotective Dad</a>. It also complicates matters if the parents have more than one child (especially if one is adopted and they are treated more as guardians than parents) and treat them on a very different level. Their behavior might belong on a different category depending on the child.

</p><p>Note that it can include older siblings and caretakers behaving as parents would.

Even the protagonist can indulge in this and remain sympathetic. The author will tell you these are forgivable mistakes, often with no knowledge of the bad consequences on the child, and understandably so: a better alternative could be imagined, but this one isn't this bad. It is really no big deal and will have no consequences even though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter">Bratty Teenage Daughter</a> will complain about this for a while.
<p>No examples, please, as it is too subjective!
</p></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Type I: That was bad parenting </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
The protagonist can indulge in this and remain sympathetic, <em>but</em> expect either a redemption, or a small temporary decrease in popularity. It is mostly well-intentioned extremism, but can also be indifference toward something they think isn't important for the child.

He thinks that having it around as a reminder of her mother will only make her depression worse (but since one tile is missing, the pawn shop owner says he doesn't think the set will sell). Shino is quite upset to learn about this, since she had hoped to enter a mahjong tournament in order to get her mother to come find her. However, when Kousuke sees Shino entering a tournament and enjoying herself, he comes up to her afterward and apologizes, saying that he was too busy with his job and the search for her mother to pay attention to her. He tells her that he will support what she wants to do from now on and gets the set back from the shop; they start playing together again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, Hana's mother, Yuri, passes out after learning that her daughter is doing tankery due to no longer being satisfied with flower arranging. Upon coming to, Yuri tries to find out if something is bothering Hana and tries to convince her that her flower arranging is good. After Hana reiterates her desire to do tankery, Yuri tells her never to come home again. Hana, however, remains convinced that her mother will come around, and she <em>does</em>, after seeing that Hana's flower arranging has improved and is taking on its own style as a result of doing tankery.

She seems to do a better job than their parents. "Better" in the sense that she constantly reminds them of their duties at school and work, at least. In spite of this, when it comes to their emotional and psychological needs, she can't do much about it as she has her own personal issues.

It's revealed that Andrei resented his father for not telling him the reason behind his mother's death and believed that he got her killed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It gets worse later on when Andrei kills his own father on the assumption that he's helping the Federation rebels</span>. However, Sergei's father-daughter relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Soma Peries</a> / Marie Parfacy is way better. When Soma's personality as Marie returns, he tells Allelujah to keep her out of battle and is grateful when Marie told him that the Soma Peries personality still sees him as a father. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This was used later on when Soma/Marie told Andrei that the colonel still cared for him and couldn't bring himself to tell the truth about his mother's death, much to Andrei's grief and regret</span>.

Kaburagi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em> is a single father who is constantly working at his dream job as a superhero. He doesn't spend time with his daughter, who lives with her uncle and grandmother and doesn't care about him being a superhero. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This becomes a problem later on when Kotetsu's powers start to dwindle and he has trouble trying to explain this to her and his partner, Barnaby.</span>

And then he ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver">dead</a>. The mother chose to stay on Earth and is heavily implied to have been having an affair. However, Amuro still cares about her by the time he returns to Earth and his hometown. The relationship fell apart when Amuro killed a Zeon soldier in front of her and he outright said that he has to fight to protect, which his mother doesn't accept.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>, Touko's parents are shown to be loving, if a bit aloof, but unwittingly encourage Touko to be just like her sister Mio after the latter's death seven years before the start of the story. Touko's father does try to suggest that Touko doesn't need to push herself so hard, but Touko has spent so long chasing after Mio that she doesn't take it well. After Touko successfully revives the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay">School Play</a>, a school tradition that ended after Mio's death, Touko's parents realize that they should be there for her more.

His father doesn't really have any place trying to parent him when he is home either given how emotionally abusive he is without even realizing it and the fact that he tends to treat Tim as a status symbol rather than his own person. Bruce's displeasure with the Drakes' parenting was made clear long before Tim got his own ongoing:

The decision is justified, since the Matsumotos need the money, but the rather blunt way Mrs. Matsumoto delivers the news results in Erwin feeling bitter for some time.

Mrs. Bennet is neurotic and self-focused, but both practical and well-meaning. Mr. Bennet is overly snarky and not implicated enough in his two youngest daughters' lives, but also kind and well-meaning (it is stated as such in the many analyses and in the DVD commentary). The book was much more pejorative in its treatment of their education.
</li><li> Hank Pym from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1">Ant-Man</a></em> had a strained relationship with his daughter, Hope, and lied to her about her mother's death. As a result, Hope sides with Darren Cross to take over his company until she found out that Cross is not a nice man so she went back to her father. However, Hank refuses to let Hope take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AntMan">Ant-Man</a> mantle and instead has the ex-con, Scott Lang, do it.

<ul><li> Mrs Dashwood in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em>. She is one of the best mothers in Jane Austen's books, but she never realizes that Elinor, her eldest daughter who isn't as passionate as her and her younger daughter, can suffer as deeply as them, and acts much more constructively as the author quickly notes before explicitly writing that the favorite is Marianne, not Elinor. It reinforces Elinor's isolation in a painful situation out of which she pulls herself alone.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion">Persuasion</a></em>, Lady Russel encourages the young and innocent Anne to dump her fiancé. Despite her good intentions and true generosity, she is proven wrong when she imagines the marriage wouldn't have worked only because of class pride and a quick first impression of the gentleman. This despite the fact that she <em>has been around Sir Walter Eliott</em> for years, and knows that aristocracy isn't the guarantee for a good personality. She even recognizes it innerly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma">Emma</a></em>: Mr Woodhouse let his daughter become the mistress of the house and convinced her that he couldn't bear her marriage if she left home.

However, her "mollycoddling" (as Harry calls it) and overprotectiveness can be annoying to Harry, Hermione and the younger Weasley children in the fifth book, when they're not allowed to attend meetings of the Order. However, she and the rest of the adults are doing what Dumbledore had told them to: that is, keeping Harry in the dark regarding his connection to Voldemort, which resulted in Sirius' death.

Except, when you see all Jackson goes through, it isn't even funny, and numerous times it isn't completely supposed to be. This was finally acknowledged in an episode where Miley accused her grandmother of favoring Jackson over her. Grandma's answer? "Of course, I do. If I didn't, who would?". Robbie Ray recognizes that the situation is bad and tells Jackson that he is proud of him. Unfortunately Miley unwittingly steals the spotlight and by next episode everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">snaps back</a>.

They are very conservative and quite strict, but they mean well and (unless <em>Alison</em> is possessed or <em>they</em> are possessed) treat their daughters in a coherent, constructive and loving way. However, they also force them to apply themselves to quite high and sometimes contradictory standards. This leads to many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">The Reason You Suck Speeches</a> from one of them to the other. Their daughter Bridget later feels neglected in comparison of the two other much more glaringly perfect sisters.

<ul><li> Since Arielle, the eldest daughter, behaves as a caretaker and is influenced by their behavior, she is also a part of the equation. She behaves mostly as they ask but treats Bridget much more harshly than they do, and finds her free-minded, less socially conformist behavior annoying. Bridget ends up lashing out at her, viciously telling her why she won't miss her when she goes to college. Arielle is very affected, and it takes a ghost intervention to set things right.

She implies that he's often away from home at night, and only seems to think about him when reflecting on the deal she made with him- she can stay in her current school if she wins the mahjong tournament.

When Knuckles was still just an egg, Locke had him bombarded with radiation from a Chaos Emerald. When Knuckles was three, Locke began training him to be Guardian of Angel Island. This upset his wife, Lara-Le, and the two argued on how to raise Knuckles. The two divorced and Locke, being a Guardian, was given full custody of Knuckles. When Knuckles was five, they moved out of the city and into the wilderness, where Knuckles' training continued. Oh, and Locke told Knuckles his mother was <em>dead</em>. When Knuckles was ten, Locke told his son he had to leave, then walked into a wall of fire, leaving Knuckles completely alone so that he would grow up to become independent. Until Knuckles was 15, Locke had him under constant surveillance to monitor his progress. Locke admits that his parenting skills are lacking, but he was more concerned with making Knuckles into a good Guardian than being a good dad.

He also refuses to listen to her pleas and tells her "You cannot imagine how much I am ashamed of you" while also knowing that his approval and her people were so important for her that she considered letting go of the possibility of freedom for them. He eventually gets better, and had apparently always been kinder up to this period, but during this moment, he clearly but briefly crosses a line. This was not approved of by some highly-regarded members of Native American communities, as it goes against a Native American principle to always listen to one's children. However, he redeems himself for this and becomes non-abusive when he listens to her in the end of the movie, which an American Indian spokesman described as the moment in which the movie redeemed itself by showing someone practicing an American Indian culture accurately by way of this character, at least on this point.

They let Mrs. Norris bring Fanny down, Lady Bertram is lazy and self-involved and Lord Bertram is offensive and critical while it is not needed and tries to make her accept an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>. But Lord Bertram means well and treats her decently and Lady Bertram loves Fanny dearly. This is evidenced by the generally positive view of Lord Bertram and his (justified after the narrator) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment, and Lady Bertram's ironic but ultimately sympathetic portrayal as a sensitive but self-involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Lazy Bum</a>. Their actions nevertheless lead to Maria and Julia turning into inconsiderate spoiled young girls, which leads to a lot of the problems in the story, but this part was unintended. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> of the book seems to be partly that deep and well-thought education is an important thing, and mustn't be neglected in order to avoid creating self-destructive and self-centered people.

It is outright stated in the book that their parenting mistakes and Mr Bennet's failure at showing respect to his wife are the cause of the family's problems. It can be explained thus:
<ul><li> Mr Bennet, despite a great intelligence allied with quick wit and much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassDissonance">Jerkass Dissonance</a>, is a cold, critical and neglectful father who leaves all the parenting to his impulsive, mean-spirited, verbally abusive, self-involved and extremely neurotic but ultimately loving wife. He unwittingly forces the children to "choose sides", which is very blatant with all the sisters but the eldest: Elizabeth is a younger <em>girler</em> version of him, with more compassion and indulgence, but still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">proud</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judge of Character</a>. Mary tries to impress him by gaining knowledge and a level-headed exterior, but ultimately ridicules herself. The two other sisters are younger versions of the mother, one of which may be hurt by her father's disdain and controls herself, while the other couldn't care less and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ruins the family's reputation because she really doesn't care about the only rational parent's opinion (seeing the way he treats her, many modern readers may accept this as understandable).</span>
</li><li> This directly causes: Elizabeth showing interest in Wickham and imagining that Darcy is a monster while he is more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> and after the revelation becomes her future husband, being asked to marry Mr. Collins, and getting humiliated, Jane to temporarily lose her fiancé, Lydia to marry a remorseless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> who <em>likes</em> her, and Mary and Kitty to witness all this and react in the most screwed-up way possible.
</li><li> All of the daughters have screwed-up ideas of how people are supposed to behave in relationships, perhaps caused by a feeling of inferiority. Jane doesn't show her interest, Elizabeth is perfectly fine with the man she flirted with marrying a mildly richer woman (and even comments on how <em>modest</em> he is by choosing someone not-so-rich), and Lydia is no exception.

Seeing this threat to his kingdom, and unable to find a solution, the Pale King became desperate and decided on a 'cruel' plan - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Killing thousands of his own children to have them reanimated with Void as Vessels, which could then contain and seal the Radiance.</span> The exact details of what he did are not known, however from context clues in the game, it is likely that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Queen spread her 'seeds' or left her eggs in the Abyss. Their spawn then died in the Abyss, and Shades from the Void became infused into their dead shells, taking their shape and purpose and becoming Vessels. These Vessels then competed with each other to crawl out of the Abyss by instinctively going towards the only source of light at the top of the Abyss drop. This light may have been from the Pale King himself, standing at the top of the Abyss and watching as the Vessels struggled towards him. The Vessels that failed to make it to the top fell down to the bottom of the Abyss, their shells cracking on impact and releasing their Shades, but now with no shells to give them purpose.</span> This continued until the entire base of the Abyss is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">literally covered in thousands of broken bugshells, with aggressive lost Shades occasionally forming and dissipating.</span> After getting the 'perfect' Vessel he wanted, the Pale King sealed the 'refuse and regret' away and refused to return to the Abyss or face those remaining Vessels ever again. Both parents were not entirely heartless, the Pale King was more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> and felt remorse but reasoned there "was no cost too great" in sacrificing his spawn for the sake of preserving the Kingdom and his subjects. The White Lady felt great shame for her part in the Vessel's creation, and despite her "voracious desire" to keep breeding, had herself physically bound to prevent herself from ever birthing more spawn as a kind of penance. Ironically however, it is because the King was not entirely heartless and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bonded with the original Hollow Knight and tarnished it with an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrewBeyondTheirProgramming">idea instilled</a>"</span> that doomed the plan, making all the sacrifices pointless.

When the Hogwarts invitation arrived for Harry, Vernon did all his might to prevent him from touching it until Hagrid intervenes, It gets worse in the second book where he locks up all of Harry's wizarding stuff and after Harry received a warning from the Ministry of Magic due to Dobby's meddling, Vernon locks him up in his room with full intent to keep him from returning to Hogwarts. He gets civil to his nephew later on with one rule which is not mentioning about magic to anyone. Then in the fifth book, he attempted to kick Harry out of the house upon learning that Voldemort is back to kill him until Dumbledore's Howler came to remind him. Though he is one of the most despised characters in the series, the only thing that prevents him from being a fully blown monster is his love for his wife and son, Petunia and Dudley. Though he and his wife were also terrible parents toward Dudley in a different way, spoiling and indulging him, never punishing him for anything, and never raising him to be a good person. In the sixth book, Dumbledore points out that what they've done to Dudley is actually worse than what they've done to Harry.

What she does is mostly supervised by her mom, Catherine. She physically and emotionally abuses her and flirts with her daughter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBoyfriend">Bastard Boyfriend</a> while encouraging Adalind to pursue him because he's powerful and she's got evil plans to carry out. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">Adalind isn't being efficient enough</a>, Catherine throws her out, and almost shouts : "You're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever">Defiled Forever</a>, geddit?".

As of season 2, episode 9, she tried to rip her daughter's heart out after learning that Regina wanted her hurt. This serves to contrast Cora/Regina, since Regina does a lot of sacrifices for her son.
<ul><li> As of 2x16 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cora does love her daughter, but a spell prevented her from feeling it properly for most of her life.

He pretty much sees any human being as a possible live specimen for his mad research, his family included, and has no qualms into snatching their soul away to put them in an inanimate doll (so they become animated) and having them serve as his research project or weapon. The complete one is made of his wife, the incomplete one is made of his daughter, and he left it for his son Carl to finish, completely traumatizing the little boy and making him hate the man. And when the boy has the gall to call him out? Relius just either nonchalantly attempts to kill him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and the resident buxom doctor who calls out his 'awesome' parenting skill</a>) or just shoves him the extent of his mad research, knowing that he'd pass out (in which case he'd probably move in for the kill if uninterrupted).

Kotoko's parents forced her into child prostitution. Nagisa's parents used him as a test subject to see how much one could study before breaking as part of a twisted experiment for Hope's Peak Academy.

He's a thoroughly nasty vampire lord who allowed the Daedric Lord of Rape and Domination, Molag Bal, to have his way with both his wife and his daughter in order to make them vampires, and then became obsessed with a prophecy to blot out the sun, to the point that he sealed his daughter in darkness for at least a thousand years for trying to defy him, and drove his wife to hide out in the Soul Cairn just to get away from him. And then when he sees his daughter, Serana, again, all he gives a damn about is whether or not she has the Elder Scroll he needs to make the prophecy a reality. And he doesn't even give a damn about Serana at all, only about her blood which can be used to blot out the sun, which he tries to kill her for at the end of the Dawnguard storyline.

If BJ refuses, he does it himself, calling his son weak. Once the Nazis take over, he happily sells out his neighbors and friends to them and even his own wife once she calls him out for it. BJ confronts him years later and slaughters him without flinching.
