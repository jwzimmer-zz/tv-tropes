<p>Some people just don't have the best fortune. They may have done something really embarrassing or regretful in their past that they're now completely ready to leave behind...if only everyone, their mother, and their dog wouldn't keep bringing it up at every opportunity.
</p><p>Once Done, Never Forgotten describes any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> situation where a character has done something in the past that other characters (or the universe itself) won't let them forget. The <em>nature</em> of the deed isn't terribly important for the purposes of this trope; it could be anything from downright evil to benign or even funny. Whatever the case may be, the important part is that this deed casts a shadow on the character wherever they go.

Just as often, however, the trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, with old embarrassments being repeatedly brought up for the cast's amusement (as well as our own). In comedic examples, the target of the mockery may become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, and the mockery tends to be more playful and lighthearted than hateful.

He was warned not to participate in any sporting event again. Even though he redeems himself in the very same race this year, later that day his reputation would only sink even <em>lower</em> than before, in the Mock Cavalry Battle that again decided the winner. Mainly because the loss was due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">accidentally groping Juliet and passing out from a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed">Nosebleed</a> in the process.</span> Not only was Romio ousted from his position as Black Dog leader, he gets an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname">Embarrassing Nickname</a> on top of it.

Nao Tomori catches him in the act and forces him to transfer to her school to help track down other ability wielders and stop them from abusing their powers. Yuu becomes a better person over time, but that doesn't stop Nao from snarking at him for being a cheater, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">often when he expresses genuine sympathy over her traumatic past</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Z's</a></em> Buu Saga, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Gotenks</a> was hyped up to be the hero who would defeat Majin Buu and save the world, but he utterly <em>failed</em> to do so, getting his ass handed to him by Fat Buu and losing to Super Buu because he was more concerned with showboating and trying to make himself look cool. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Super</a></em>, the rest of the Z-Fighters have decided that Gotenks is too immature and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid">Lethally Stupid</a> to be relied upon for anything; come the Tournament of Power, they tell Goten and Trunks point-blank that they're <em>not</em> on the team because the last time they depended on Gotenks to save the world, he completely screwed up and nearly got everyone killed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>: Yukari will always be Sergeant Third-Class Oddball for Saunders students, after her attempt to infiltrate the school under that name.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em>: One year before the start of the series, before the match between Kidokawa Seishuu and Teikoku Academy in the Football Frontier finals, Gouenji ran away from the match because his sister suffered a bad accident, leading to his team being disqualified. After changing school and getting back into soccer one year later, Gouenji had to face off Kidokawa in the semi-finals. His former teammates, particularly the Mukata triplets, still hated him and continued to mock him for running away, at least until they learn the truth about his sister, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">after which they stop taunting him</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a>:</em>
<ul><li> In the first chapter, Bakugou gets attacked by a sludge villain and is held hostage before being rescued by All Might. The other students at Ultra Academy know better than to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">anger him</a> by bringing it up, but civil servants and upper authorities with the academy and Hero Association still refer to him as "That kid from the slime monster incident." Someone brings it up at some point during the sports festival, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bakugo gets kidnapped by the League of Villains</span>, and during the Provisional License exam.
</li><li> After the Provisional License Exams just before the start of the second term in September, Bakugo starts a fight with Midoriya, who fights back and ultimately loses, resulting in both boys being confined to the dorms for a few days. Iida is rather annoyed with both of them for acting out, and even refers to them as "the lockdown boys" the following spring.
</li><li> Sero is subject to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> courtesy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Todoroki</a> at the Sports Festival. Given the overwhelming difference in raw power, everyone in the audience tells him, "Don't worry about it!" He moans about this later, as people continued to tell him this even after the Sports Festival ended. His classmates sympathize with him before telling him, "Don't worry about it!"
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, when the Straw Hat Pirates reunite after a two-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, Zoro of all people (he's the most notorious offender of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfDirection">No Sense of Direction</a> in the crew) was the first to arrive at their meeting place. He proceeds to rub it in everyone's faces by calling them by the order they have arrived in (with him as Number 1, of course), to Sanji's chagrin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpiritCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpiritCircle">Spirit Circle</a></em> features Flors the architect, who journeys to build a sphinx in a far-off land and ends up being known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpusDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpusDissonance">only for that</a>, even though he thought of the project as a failure. He spends the rest of his life as a distant, bitter old man; his last breath begging for <em>anyone</em> to simply use his name rather than calling him "Master Sphinx".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a>:</em> Early in the Chapter Black arc, Team Urameshi got caught in a game of Taboo where the loser could potentially lose his soul. Hiei deliberately disregarded the rules of the game out of impatience, leading to him being the first to lose his soul, which became a frequent source of mockery for him.

</li><li> Batman will <em>never</em> let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Huntress">Huntress</a> live down her body count of mobsters. Justified, because Batman is <em>infamous</em> for his adherence to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a>, and Huntress began her career as a vigilante specifically to deliver lethal punishment to criminals, which she is sometimes portrayed as unrepentant about doing and/or continuing to do.
</li><li> For two decades, between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ADeathInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ADeathInTheFamily">A Death in the Family</a></em> and <em>Under the Red Hood</em>, if Jason Todd got brought up after his death, it was usually other characters blaming him for dying. Which came after his mother, who Jason had been trying to reconnect with, sold him out to the Joker, who then bludgeoned Jason with a crowbar.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hal Jordan's run as the supervillain Parallax, although it's a bit milder than most other examples, as he was later revealed to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> at the time.
</li><li> Guy Gardner will never live down the time he annoyed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> so much that Bats knocked him out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">with a single punch</a>, or the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> almost stole his girlfriend Ice from him.

In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">the Skrull spy</a> that impersonated him resented having to pose as a wife beater. Never mind that Hank hit Janet <em>once</em>, and was undergoing a mental breakdown at the time. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Never Live It Down</a> nature of this incident has even been deconstructed a few times. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretEmpire">Secret Empire</a></em>, when Tony Stark snidely brings it up during an argument, Hank goes on a violent tirade, ranting about how unfair and ridiculous it is that he still gets crap for this one mistake in spite of all his other accomplishments and apologies while Tony himself has made mistakes with much worse consequences yet is always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a> for them.

What is frequently overlooked is that the king in question was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killed to prevent him from roasting a city full of people alive</span>. The reasons this became Jaime's defining moment are either because only a few people knew of this (and most of them were killed in the uprising that night) or they deliberately chose not to mention it.
</li><li> Walder Frey is nicknamed the "Late Walder Frey" by Lord Hoster Tully when Walder came to Robert's Rebellion <em>after</em> Robert killed Rhaegar and, as a result, Walder is viewed as the cowardly weasel that he is.

Torrhen is still remembered in both the North and the South as the "king who knelt," and for ending centuries of independence in the North. Never mind that he saved countless lives on both sides of the conflict by kneeling, and insured that his house would enjoy years of prosperity as Wardens of the North.

The fact that the majority of the population were Imperial soldiers also tends to be ignored.

This gets referenced two or three times a season for the rest of the show's run, usually in terms of "I can't believe he didn't get brig time for that", or "you should've seen him in the courtroom."

<ul><li> When Jack McCoy has an argument with one of his subordinates over questionable tactics, expect the phrase "You once hid a witness" to come up. In the episode "Under The Influence" (s8e11), McCoy hid an exculpatory witness from the defense, in order to maintain murder charges against a drunk driver who killed three pedestrians. (He later relented, but still faced sanctions for his actions — incidentally, from the judge who initially <em>encouraged</em> him to do this, because he was mad that McCoy didn't follow through.)
</li><li> Similarly, expect the fact that he slept with Claire Kincaid to pop up at least once a season.

</li><li> In the title's original context, personal assault wasn't even the focus.

However this gets subverted when records of the original geth-quarian war reveal that it was mostly a war between pro-geth quarians and anti-geth quarians... then swings right back when one remembers the quarians alive today are not the same quarians who fought in that initial war and that some are open peace with the geth, or at least don't want to fight them.
</li><li> Another instance of this trope appears near the end of the Mars mission. In order to stop an infiltration unit created by Cerberus from leaving with the plans for the Crucible, James Vega rams the Cerberus shuttle with the Kodiak they used to to reach Mars.
