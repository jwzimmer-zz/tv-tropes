<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Sukisho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Sukisho">Sukisho</a></em>: In the game, it's revealed that Sunao was raped by Aizawa and his men during his time in the lab. In the series proper, Sunao clearly suffers from PTSD as a result and has abandonment issues. He even tries to stab Aizawa with scissors in a moment of insanity in the anime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk">Basilisk</a></em>: Kagerou was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">never very stable to begin with</a>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting raped and brutally tortured by Tenzen drove her off the deep end completely</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> 2003 anime;, it was implied that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose</span> was raped by Amestris soldiers. She went mute after that, but she didn't start acting unusual until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dante manipulated her (potentially through drugging her)</span>. She does eventually get better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue">Perfect Blue</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mima begins to lose her grip on reality after she is supposedly raped for a film during her new acting career. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Or does she get raped?</a> After this scenario is shown, we hear a bell ring and a director yell "Cut!" and the movie continues into more twists and turns. Also, Mima gets photographed by a borderline rapist who convinced her to get naked for him to photograph. He gets uncomfortably close to her while she's naked and takes obscene pictures of her. The risqué photo shoot is indispersed with shots of her stabbing the hell out of the photographer. Also, it's implied the stabbing was Rumi's doing.
</li><li> Zigzagged with Rumi. During Mima's implied rape scene for a movie she's filming; it is at that point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Rumi starts to lose it</a> as she's watching the recording, crying hysterically. You realize that Rumi may already have been unstable and delusional, but this and the risque photo shoot were the things that pushed her permanently over the edge. Or even worse, if Rumi was already delusional, she thought she was seeing herself getting raped, because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeYou">saw herself as Mima</a>. It gets worse when you consider just how strongly she protested Mima doing it in the first place and how it connects with the conclusion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Casca went mute and regressed to a childlike state after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a horrifying rape at the hands of her former commander turned demon god Femto</span> during the Eclipse. It's also implied that she's becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInsomniac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInsomniac">an insomniac</a> as a result. And she slaughters some men after the Eclipse who attempted to rape her. It's implied that the demons who stripped her naked during the Eclipse went further than that, as we see one sticking tentacles in her mouth as it's stripping and groping her with the others. One also tries to rape her with a spike on its head and succeeds at penetrating her with the tip, though a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorShadow">Censor Shadow</a> makes the penetration less noticeably obvious. Luckily, it stops to watch Femto being born before going any deeper. During these moments, we see her sanity get destroyed and she retreats into herself. During later chapters, when two characters get a first-hand look at the horrors Casca endured during the Eclipse, they are scared out of their wits, with Casca commenting that the violations that befelled her were viscerally disgusting.
</li><li> Guts is a more mundane/less supernatural example. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid">Used to Be a Sweet Kid</a>, but now he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Hero</a> with some serious issues that also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatesBeingTouched">Hates Being Touched</a>. He became this way after he was raped as a kid  exacerbated by the fact that it came about due to betrayal by his adopted father  and it just got worse with the Eclipse where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">Forced to Watch</a> the above-mentioned rape in circumstances that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">all but mirrored his own traumatic childhood ordeal</a></span>. He then develops an even more horrific version of PTSD and an insanely violent split personality that tries to goad him into raping and dismembering Casca. Let's just say that he has all the reason in the world to want Griffith dead.
</li><li> Princess Charlotte lost it when her <em>own father</em> tried to rape her because she was starting to resemble her mother and Griffith sought her out for sex which infuriated her father. This alienated her from him, and when his health suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">due to the horror and guilt over what he had almost done</a>, she refused to see him on his deathbed, and we see her crying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenTears">Broken Tears</a> over the whole ordeal, begging for Griffith to come help her.
</li><li> It's weird that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">Torture Technician</a> never mentioned it in his graphic description of what he did to him over a year, but Griffith was probably castrated during his torture. It was probably the first thing to go, in fact, since his crime was having sex with Charlotte, so it would make sense that the instrument used to commit the crime would be the first thing to be destroyed. He probably didn't get there because Guts rammed his sword through him, and the door. However, by the completely depraved tone the guy spoke as he talked about Griffith and his beauty and how Griffith was made of fine material for the man to do his stuff on... He might have also done... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">other things</a> to Griffith. If the man's job was to make Griffith suffer as much as possible, sexual abuse has to be taken into account as well as physical. The implied rape as well as the other aspects of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> led to him to try to commit suicide and become irreversibly evil. Even before that, Griffith prostituted himself to an old man (Gennon) to fund his army and he's clearly hurting something fierce afterwards, showing that it wasn't wanted on his end and he gouges his fingernails into his arms till they bleed. Further shown when he has sex with Princess Charlotte as his eyes have an emotionless coldness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare">Kubrick Stare</a> to them as if he is in a bad state mentally from all he has done to try to achieve his goal of gaining a kingdom and is trying to repair his pride. Almost like after his night with Gennon and other horrors his mind goes to a bad place during sex. And when he rapes Casca, its clear hes going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeByProxy">Rape by Proxy</a> because of the possible sexual torture that came with the general torture when he was held captive for a year along with other sustained trauma and in order to make Guts and Casca suffer more (he may be trying to mirror Guts own rape for maximum <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> purposes) and out of a bad case of unrequited love as its implied he had feelings for both Guts and Casca and they had became a couple. Indeed after that when he is reborn hes constantly sporting a Stoic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare">Kubrick Stare</a> and since he became a god hand he has all the internalized insanity and sadism that comes with it.
</li><li> A latter mass torture scene shows such things as a woman having a massive spiky implement rammed up her genital area and when a older woman sees this as well as the other forms of torture she lets out a shriek of insanity and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfFear">Tears of Fear</a> before she is also put to torture.
</li><li> Farnese is almost made to be raped by a possessed horse and all of this coupled with non con touching by some demons sends the poor girl into madness briefly. Guts has a nasty bout of PTSD and flashbacks to Cascas rape when the horse is trying to rape Farnese and he decapitates the horse in a fit of rage.
</li></ul></li><li> In episode 20 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Cross Ange</a></em>, it turns out that this is the reason <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jill lost it; the original Libertus had ended in failure because Embryo raped her in both mind and body</span>.
<ul><li> Ange herself finds her mental and emotional stability tested with all the times Embryo tries mind control her into going to bed with him and finally tries to rape her because she kept rejecting him.

<ul><li> Konuma Ryuuko is a nymphomaniac middle-schooler with what appears to be profound psychological damage from repeated rapes in her past, which made her a nihilistic sociopath.

</li><li> Haguro raped and beat Chiba out of jealousy because of Chiba talking to Inugami when Haguro wasn't around, and it doesn't end well for him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler II</a></em>:
<ul><li> The most notable happens in the second season, considering Alois' whole life is a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a>. After his little brother and entire village are killed, this already slightly off boy (who laughed cheerfully as he robbed the dead) begins living as a true city street rat. Knowing how things like that work out, and especially after seeing his reactions to things later on, it's quite obvious that this young boy solicited himself for food or shelter before he even hit a double digit age. Think about this: Jim is only around 11 when he goes to Earl Trancy's manor. There, he living with a bunch of boys in the same condition, being bathed and treated like cattle, all while being a sex slave to an old man. At the age of 11. It's quite obvious even then he is not a virgin, as he dolls up and puts on a beautiful red robe, seducing the old man expertly until the guy's kissing his feet. He even becomes the favorite boy, taking place for the man's son who vanished as a baby - the real Alois Trancy which allows him to take the name Alois after Claude kills the Earl. Episode 8 shows that Alois was raped by the former Lord Trancy. It's implied that this helped make him so Ax-Crazy  he's shown to have been a little off-kilter even before the event, having joked about his entire village dying and happily looted their corpses when they actually did, but his violent tendencies seem to date from it, not to mention his compulsive promiscuity.

Some flashbacks Ciel had during the Ship Arc reveal that before being sacrificed, Ciel had his shirt ripped apart with a knife, cut the same way Maurice tore the shirt, indicating possible rape at the hands of the cult. This is not helped how in the opening song of season 3 we see an image of Ciel being manhandled to the ground in the past by the cultists. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is confirmed in a later chapter.

It's implied in the first book when one of Olaf's mooks has Violet captive and reassures him "I understand boss. She's yours boss." that the hook handed man is reassuring Olaf he won't lay a hand on Violet because Olaf wants to be the first one to sexually assault her and lay claim to her. Olaf also rubs a knife against her thigh in the second book and in the tv series touches Violet while telling Klaus he'll touch whatever he wants. The Hostile Hospital book mentions that Olaf was the one to prep her for surgery (ie. changing her into the hospital gown). Given that, the fact that Violet seems much more prone to having breakdowns after the eighth book (PTSD, much?), and how much more smug Olaf acts around the children, Olaf may have done more than just changed her clothes while he had her in his clutches. He also refers to her good looks more than once and has no concept of personal space as do other male characters all of which traumatized her.

Her father and brother later describe being forced to clean anti-Hitler graffiti and to spit in each other's faces, but her mother returns with torn clothing and refuses to say what happened to her when she was separated from the men; the implication is fairly clear. She falls into a deep depression and ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">takes her own life</a>.
</li><li> Carnival from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeepgateCodex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeepgateCodex">Deepgate Codex</a></em> series. The rape was particularly brutal, and even after three millennia, she's still not over it.

She kills her attackers, and this begins a life of violence. It's part of what makes her into someone who's callous and lacking in introspection.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em>, Christian Grey was underage when an adult woman had sex with him. He denies that this was rape, and the heroine is jealous instead of disgusted when she meets his rapist, but in any case it was statutory rape. Considering his inability to differentiate between consensual sex and rape in the relationship with Ana, it is highly unlikely that this sexual abuse didn't affect him negatively.
</li><li> Part of the reason that Kennit, of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LiveshipTraders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LiveshipTraders">Liveship Traders</a></em> trilogy, is so messed up is that he was repeatedly raped (among other abuse) as a child. This leads to...repercussions, later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterhoodSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterhoodSeries">Sisterhood Series</a></em> by Fern Michaels: The first book Weekend Warriors reveals that three bikers raped Kathryn Lucas in front of her disabled husband, and they knew that her husband was disabled and helpless to stop them. Naturally, she was left badly scarred by this. The book has her and her new friends track down the three bikers responsible and give them the John Wayne Bobbit treatment in order for her to obtain closure in this matter. After that book, her attitude remains as combative, confrontational, explosive and fiery as ever, which suggests that her behaviour may simply be part of who she is, and not just the result of her being raped. Or perhaps that the scars were too deep to be healed by one act of vengeance....
</li><li> Used to effect in Nick Cave's <em>And the Ass Saw the Angel</em> when toward the end, the narrator reveals that he got raped one time. He's already so completely insane that its lack of effect on him feels wholly in-character.
</li><li> In <em>Books of the Raksura</em>, the main character, Moon, a Raksura, never saw another member of his species and didn't even know how they were called or if he was the only one left. Moon was desperately trying to find any signs, anything about his race, until he found a city attacked by the Fell, a race of vicious flying predators who eat intelligent beings. There, a Fell ruler (always male gender) called Liheas tried to brainwash him into thinking he was Fell too, and then raped him, after which Moon realized he was not one of them and broke the ruler's neck while the ruler was sleeping, then set the room on fire and escaped. Because of this traumatic event, he stopped all attempts to ever try to find his race, didn't care anymore about himself for a long time, and became cynical, wary and distrustful of others, especially of the Fell and even more of the Raksura.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LetTheRightOneIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LetTheRightOneIn">Let the Right One In</a></em>: In the book Hakan starts off as a pedophile murdering someone for their blood, which is pretty creepy to begin with, and just gets worse as the story goes on. The incident when he pours acid over his face stands out, along with all the subsequent descriptions of what his face looks like afterward. Mindless!Vampire!Håkan is even worse, especially when he tries to rape Eli. Cranked up to eleven with Eli as he escapes nigh rape, unwittingly traping Tommy inside the completely dark bomb shelter together with Disfigured!Mindless!Zombie!Rapist!Vampire!Håkan for several hours. Tommy manages to pull through, but is clearly not all that well adjusted afterwards. Also, Eli's castration scene reads like a sexual assault affecting his sense of self and perhaps sanity worst of all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">Carrie</a>: Carrie's mother Margaret White turns out to have a pathological fear of sex, coming from equal parts religious fanaticism and the fact that her husband raped her, resulting in Carrie's birth (the fact that she ended up enjoying the act just messes her up even worse, if that's possible). This resulted in some seriously repressive parenting to Evil Matriarch levels, to the point where she didn't even tell Carrie about her body's natural processes as she got older, resulting in her first period in her senior year being traumatic in more ways than one.

Afterword, what was originally an innocent Christian school girl quickly loses her mind and pretty much becomes a ticking time bomb of hell. She slices her wrists, nearly slices her neck (before cutting off a chunk of her hair), and even lies to the school administrators that a teacher who was trying to help her through it all had molested her, resulting in his suspension.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSVU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSVU">Law &amp; Order: SVU</a></em> (Behave) has probably the most justified version of this ever seen. The victim of the week was an ordinary woman with an ordinary job and dreams and the like until she was assaulted several years in the past by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Villain of the Week</a>. The aggressor was never caught, but she moved on, went to college, and had just about graduated when the same man found her and assaulted her again, having tracked her down using a stolen driver's license he had taken the first time he attacked her. As far as the after-assault investigation went, same result. Far more traumatized this time, she moved across the country, slowly recovered, got engaged, and was just a couple weeks away from being married... when the same man tracked her down <em>again</em>. The stress and trauma eventually broke apart her engagement and the victim became a total recluse, working from home, having groceries delivered, not leaving her apartment more than once a month if she could possibly help it, and basically dealing with a full dose of the most High Octane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Paranoia Fuel</a> imaginable... until during the one day she absolutely had to leave her home for something work-related, the man finds her <strong>yet again</strong>, this time beating her bloody in the process, which is what leads into the start of the episode. As it happens, the villain was a successful travelling executive who <em>had a collection</em> of these women across the country, who used their stolen IDs to track them down and assault them repeatedly until he became the first thing they think of when they wake up and the last thing they think of when they go to sleep, feeding his ego with the idea that every minute of their lives revolves around what he's done to them and what he'll eventually do again. Even for SVU villains, he is quite beyond the pale.
<ul><li> A later episode in the same season involved a mother who had physically abused and raped (with an object) her two daughters. The older one managed to piece together a normal life after leaving home, but the younger one was so warped that she ended up assaulting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">inadvertantly killing</a> a younger girl.

It's implied to be at least partially due to his nature as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChrist">Antichrist</a>, although there are also visible bruises showing that physical abuse is also part of it.

Later, she genuinely tried to become a better person and to help people in her own way and loved animals, namely ducks. However, after she was raped by a guard she withdraws into herself, keeping to herself, and hiding under her hoodie. She also states in a emotionless manner about how she used to like ducks but not anymore after the guard showed her the ducks and treated her with kindness before later raping her. While he's doing that she looks like she's repressing her emotions and feelings about the whole event and shutting herself down to avoid the reality of what is happening to her. She later appears willing to go along with Big Boo to get revenge on the guard. Also, from a young age Pennsatucky prostituted herself and had been occasionally raped, believing it was normal because she learned this philosophy from her mother during a disturbing sex talk.

It's a little shaky on how it's portrayed; Bret is clearly traumatized afterwards though and is shown taking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerOfAngst">Shower of Angst</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rectify" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rectify">Rectify</a></em>: In a flashback, Wendall reveals to Daniel, while masturbating, that he had participated in gang raping Daniel in the shower, and Daniel mentions how he was gang raped repeatedly while in prison.

Amantha, Daniel's sister, states outright to Jon that Daniel is "damaged" as a result of his time in prison.
</li><li> Alan Shore of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal">Boston Legal</a></em> was raped by a friend of his mother's when he was fourteen. It's implied this is why his interactions with women are, in general, so messed up.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MastersOfHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MastersOfHorror">Masters of Horror</a></em> episode "Imprint", the prostitute eventually reveals that a big part of why she's so emotionally scarred is her horrific youth, where she was separately raped by both her father and a local Buddhist monk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelrosePlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelrosePlace">Melrose Place</a></em>. Jane goes off the deep end after being raped by ex-lover Richard, first stalking and terrorizing and eventually killing him, then stalking and terrorizing her other ex-lover Jake (who she pushed away after the rape) and his new girlfriend. She finally checks herself into a hospital for treatment.

Of course, his long-suffering wife Gwen was also raped as a teenager, but doesn't have nearly as many issues as he does.

From then on, he could be the poster child for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneEqualsViolent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneEqualsViolent">Insane Equals Violent</a>, as a horrifically violent gangster and enforcer, a hired killer for the Detroit Mob who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">rapes, imprisons, and tortures</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHateWhatYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHateWhatYouAre">male hustlers to death</a> and takes a huge amount of drugs while doing so.

The grief and trauma started Elliot off on a path of severe dissociative identity disorder, which results in him creating alternative personalities. In Season 4, his sister Darlene reveals that this was actually because Edward molested him (and probably Darlene too) and Elliot fought back against the abuse.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cassidy "Beaver" Casablancas' desperation to hide the fact he was raped by his Little League coach led to him raping Veronica and becoming a sociopathic serial murderer because the other victims were on the brink of accusing him publicly.</span> However, the show also portrays other survivors of sexual assault realistically and recovering from their trauma, including Veronica herself and Parker in Season 3.

<ul><li> The Whistleblower DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outlast">Outlast</a></em> has Eddie Gluskin, also known as the Groom. Having been sexually abused by his uncle and father as a child, he became obsessed with sexuality and marriage, and was already a serial killer before coming to the asylum. The experiments conducted on him there only made him worse. When you finally meet him, he has already mutilated and killed dozens of other (male) inmates, turning them into his 'brides' - and he attempts to do the same to you. He fluctuates from using creepily loving terms ("Darling!") to crazily misogynistic ones ("Filthy sluts. You're like all the others.") to outright death threats ("You don't deserve my children. You don't even deserve to live."). Gluskin is quite an unusual example as he isn't obsessed with one individual in particular; anyone he sees as being a candidate for becoming his 'bride' can fall prey to his desire, usually fatally. Although it is possible that since Waylon has survived the longest and would have been his last victim, Gluskin was "attached" to him the most, especially since he held his hand before he died.

He's shown to be very traumatized after the rapes as well.
</li><li> Meg spends her free time trying to get a boyfriend (this even includes her falling for the family dog Brian when he was nice to her) and in episodes like "Stew-Roids" and "Dial Meg For Murder" she appears to exhibit attraction toward Connie, a girl who constantly bullies her. Some episodes depict her being both emotionally fragile and disturbed, derived from a desperation for love and attention, and she self-harms herself as well. "Dial Meg For Murder" implied she'd been on both ends of multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonRape">Prison Rape</a> situations in a women's correctional institution. As a result she came back home as a coldhearted convict who terrorized everyone who ever made fun of her, including her dad, even though she had already been disturbed before the rape it definitely didn't do any favors for her mental health.
