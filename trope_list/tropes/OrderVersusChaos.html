It's also generally vague as to why the forces of discord and chaos are regimented and disciplined enough to have actual Forces of Chaos. Naturally this only applies to absolute, cosmic-level order and chaos, not human individuals who tend toward one or the other because humans are a diverse lot. Incidentally, this skews the trope in favor of Chaos, as does the very fact that there is a conflict between order and chaos in the first place.
</p><p>When classifying people as one or the other, three factors tend to get elided into one:
</p><ol><li> Whether they believe the universe to be ordered
</li><li> To what extent they support order in society
</li><li> How they conduct their lives.
</li></ol><p>There can also be a mixture within one character. For instance, a hero who flies by the seat of his pants can nevertheless believe in an orderly universe and support his society more or less according to whether it is in harmony with the greater order. Conversely, an obsessive-compulsive character may be reacting to his belief that the universe is chaotic, and society no better.

At this point, if the two are left unattended for more than <em>two seconds</em> they start pounding on each other, but both agree that he's the biggest threat.
</li><li> Tsutomu Nihei's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Blame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Blame">Blameverse</a></em> features this conflict prominently. In <em>Noise</em>, the main character is a cop investigating a cult who worship the power of chaos who are kidnapping children to use for human sacrifices in their bizarre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> rituals. When they kill her, she is resurrected by an agent of the Safeguard, protectors of order, but they turn out to be a pack of fascists who plan on disenfranchising and killing everybody who can't afford network implants and brainwashing the ones who do. Then in <em>Blame!</em>, we see the aftermath of this; the cult succeeded in throwing the world into chaos, but since they're so poorly organized their descendants, the Silicon Lives, don't amount to much more than a bunch of roving cyber-barbarians. The Safeguard doesn't fare much better, as their directives become so corrupted that they essentially believe that <em>everything</em> that's not them must be exterminated.
<ul><li> This is one of those few times in fiction where the reader is shown exactly WHY the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Order And Chaos</a> is so important and makes it clear that although Order is necessary, if it taken too far from the median line between Order and Chaos, extremes become implemented without a balancing force. In fact this is even evident in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bizarchitecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bizarchitecture">Bizarchitecture</a> seen in the manga, where widespread chaotic disruption results in the ever-growing expansion of the City, but the reason why that expansion continues is because the ordered directives of the builders demand logical progression and expansion. With no mediating force, one extreme inevitably bleeds into the other where neither are compatible for continued life.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em>, The 4th and Blue Clan stands for Order, and they get Chaos from both sides - the 3rd and Red Clan are their rivals for most of the series, but their element is Destruction. The Green Clan, JUNGLE, who Scepter 4 fights in the second season <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In an alliance with HOMRA, as well as the Silver Clan</span> is Chaos.

Many students want to put a media room in the library, but Shiori, the student librarian, won't have it, preferring the library to be a place of quiet solitude for books to be enjoyed.
</li><li> The overarching conflict in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em> is this, although it's played with a bit. The angelic Anarchy Sisters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a>, being largely just selfish jerks who want to have fun heedless of the amount of mayhem they cause while protecting the city; by contrast, the demonic Daemon Sisters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> and make serious attempts to improve the quality of life by way of tyranny and enforced conformity.
<ul><li> Given the sheer selfishness and dubious moral choices that Panty and Stocking have both made over the series, most notably Panty indifferently telling the Daemon Sisters to kill Brief, even suggesting they take a crap in his mouth first to give him a last meal, their mutual decision to abandon their fellow survivors in "...of the Dead", and Panty <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> refusing to catch Brief, even though he just restored her angelic powers, in the final episode, which leads directly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">the Daemon's plan succeeding</a></span>, it's not implausible to take a more cynical view and view the series as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> Daemon Sisters vs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a></em> Anarchy Sisters.

God is cruel tyrant, who wants to exterminate demons just because he didn't create them and they don't fit his vision of order in the world. Satan, while defending demons, despises their chaotic nature and wants to rule over them. Amon, deeply chaotic spirit, despises both of them.

</li><li> Dragon society in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em> is divided into three factions: those who seek to keep the world in order, those who seek destruction and power, and those who seek neither. Tohru, Fafnir, and Ilulu are part of the chaos faction, Elma and Clemene are part of the order faction, and Lucoa is unaligned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, this conflict is best exemplified with the introduction of the Quirk Liberation Army. The QLA, an organization spanning generations since its founding by a villain named Destro, represents Chaos and the ability to freely use the Quirks which are possessed by the majority of the population, but they use terrorist tactics to push their agenda. On the side of Order, the government and law-enforcement maintain the peace with the help of licensed heroes. While this works for the most part, it requires that Quirks be very heavily regulated, with professional heroes being the only ones legally allowed to use their Quirks in combat while anyone else would be considered a "villain" for doing so.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, this trope is why Eren abandons <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikasa</span> and rejects her allegiance. However compatible their personalities are, or how much she tries to accommodate him, they are too different on the inside to ever be allies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikasa, like everyone in her genetically-altered bloodline</span> is always trying to build hierarchies and nurture her loved ones. Eren doesn't believe <em>anyone</em> should have power over anyone else, and would eagerly burn down the world if that's what it took to remove the tyrants running it. He's horrified when he realizes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikasa</span> thinks of herself as his 'inferior'.

The series often plays with these associations, as a member of the Outer Church (the Order side) tries to convince a bunch of outsiders they're the good guys by citing the story of Ahura Mazda versus Angra Mainyu (see below).

It also featured Evil Chaos in the form of the Brotherhood of Dada, and Evil Order as Darren Jones and the Men From N.O.W.H.E.R.E. Granted, the Brotherhood of Dada wasn't evil so much as plain weird. In fact the heroes found themselves working to SAVE the Brotherhood of Dada in their second appearance and two of them even pointed out that the Brotherhood had the right idea

Several previously-existing magical beings were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> to fit in with this; Dr. Fate's mentor Nabu became a Lord of Order, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>' antagonist Mordru was revealed as a Lord of Chaos, and so on. Most portrayals of these focused on balance, especially Hawk and Dove, who represent, respectively, Chaos and Order and were created by a Lord of Order and a Lord of Chaos who had fallen in love and tried to find some happy middle.
</li><li> It also has Jack Kirby's Fourth World of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a>, where Order is represented by the oppressive tyrant, Darkseid, who demands absolute obedience and seeks the Anti-Life Equation, mastery of which will force any mind to submit to the will of he who wields it. He's opposed by the Space Hippies of New Genesis, who believe in peace and free will ("That is the Life Equation!") — and his own son, who is essentially a personification of pure, primal fury. Amazingly, though Kirby clearly spells this out several times, many writers who followed him Just Didn't Get It, and explicitly flipped around the Order and Chaos attributions of the two factions. This may be because it was most clearly stated in <em>The Forever People</em>, the least well-regarded series in the saga. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheNew52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheNew52">The New 52</a></em> Highfather and Darkseid <em>both</em> represent order, with the Forever People rejecting both of them in favour of a chaotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">third option</a>.

<ul><li> Batman upholds justice and the rule of law (the spirit if not always the letter). His mental discipline is the closest thing he has to a superpower, and prevents him from going mad in spite of all he has to deal with. Unquestionably a good guy, but difficult to get along with, and the possibility that a loss of human contact would drive him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> tendencies is a disquieting one.
</li><li> The Joker is strongly anti-authoritarian and anti-society, indiscriminately destructive, and downright insane. He's unquestionably evil, though sometimes his antics are meant to expose hypocrisy or evil in other people.

While the good guys are all allied with Order, and the demon lord Chaos is indisputably evil, it's worth noting that the Order wizard Ogeode recognizes that if Order were taken too far, it would be just as destructive as Chaos (his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">bosses</a> don't like it when he talks like this); while Chaos's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>, Moltar, was railroaded into the job and clearly doesn't really believe in it wholeheartedly, either. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Moltar finally does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> at the very end of the series.</span>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vampirella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vampirella">Vampirella</a> has a cosmic conflict between Order and Chaos with the Conjuress representing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Good and Evil</a>. By and large, Vampirella sides with Order as that is associated with good and justice. However, she has several friends on the side of Chaos. It is also noted that Chaos, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype">Satanic Archetype</a> ruler of Hell, is insane and not really doing his job well.
</li><li> Marvel also has Lord Chaos and Master Order, two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personifications</a> of the concepts. Usually Lord Chaos serves the role as the antagonist, or they both team up to protect the universe against a greater threat. An exception was when the cosmic being Edifice Rex planned to revert the universe back to a point singularity - all of the other cosmic beings opposed him, except for Master Order who thought it was a wonderful idea.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em>: V fights to bring down the oppressive government, but is careful to tell to Evey that it's law, rather than order, that he opposes. He also makes sure to explain that anarchy is not the same as chaos. This is because in oppression a resistance will always exist, while in anarchy it will not, as there is nothing to resist.
</li><li> According the comics, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Hellraiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Hellraiser">Cenobites</a> are order. In one of the more comedic stories, an obnoxious, lazy office worker spends all his time tinkering with one of the puzzle boxes, distracting his fellow employees and annoying his borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockKing">Clock King</a> boss, who easily solves the puzzle for him, summoning some Cenobites. The Cenobites prepare to take the boss to the Labyrinth, only to be told off by him; the boss says he only solved the puzzle because it was disrupting the order, productivity and perfectionism he constantly strived for, which the Cenobites are now doing. The Cenobites mull this over for a bit, eventually decide the boss is essentially "doing Leviathan's work" and decide to take the employee, who the boss had earlier described as "a gear that has become misaligned", in his place.
</li><li> The theme of Jonathan Hickman's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> is a war between science as a force for change (represented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>) and science as a means of control (represented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsaacNewton">Isaac Newton</a>). The lead character, the son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</a>, initially sides with Leonardo, before deciding both sides are wrong because they're locked into the idea there must <em>be</em> a war.
</li><li> Modern <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> comics have shades of this with emotional spectrum.
<ul><li> Green in the middle represents Order and the further you go from it, the more chaotic the corps become. Each color represents emotion, except for Green, which is willpower - the ability to overcome and control your emotions for the greater good, so the further you go from it, the less control you have.
</li><li> Blue and Yellow, hope and fear respectively, represent how you can use the emotions to affect and shape the world. Their goal is to establish order, but Blue Lanterns see it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">harmony</a> that can be built only in cooperation with Green, while the Sinestro Corps tries to impose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">tyranny</a> and rule the Universe with an iron fist.
</li><li> Orange and Indigo - greed and compassion - represent what happens when you let your emotions define your life. Indigo Tribe sacrifice their individuality for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">the common good</a>, but it makes them detached and borderline sociopathic. Larfleeze, on the other hand, is completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil">selfish</a> and cares only about himself.
</li><li> And finally we have Pink and Red - love and anger - who represent Chaos. Members of both corps lose their minds, taken by the representative emotion. Star Sapphires want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">spread love through the Universe</a> and are willing to go to extremes to do so, as well as tending towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">yanderish</a> behavior. Red Lanterns are a horde of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">berserkers</a> destroying everything in their path and often fighting between each other, when not provided with better (as in, any) targets. In the beginning they were mindless and bestial, but Atrocitus allowed them to regain some degree of self-control since then.
</li><li> It should be noted that Order isn't presented as completely good and Chaos as completely evil. The White Entity is composed of white light, (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">formed when all of the seven colors are combined</a>), and represents life, which is a combination of all emotions, as well as order and chaos in all their forms. Meanwhile, Black represents absence of emotions and life, the state of emptiness and stasis. The Guardians' actions to purge emotions from the Green Lantern Corps allowed the forces of Black to infiltrate them, as their actions have bought them too close to this cold, emotionless state.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NemesisTheWarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NemesisTheWarlock">Nemesis the Warlock</a></em> pits the titular powerful alien wizard in service of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">Kaos</a> against the tyrannical bigot ruling humanity, Torquemada. At first it looks like Chaos/Nemesis is good and Order/Torquemada is bad, but as the series goes on it becomes clear Nemesis is manipulating both people around him and readers as well to portray himself as a hero, but in reality is a cruel, bored god <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">prolonging the war for his own amusement</a>, because Torquemada is the only man to give him any challenge. At the end it's clear they are both bastards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> fits this theme. The Romans are well-organised (the story occasionally lampshades their beautiful maneuvers as a form of history-porn), trained, dress in uniforms, live in elegant villas or tidy little fortified camps, and are cultured and structured — although the characters given to the individual Romans show the cracks in the façade. The Gauls, on the other hand, have long, wild hair and facial hair, live in ramshackle huts, actively resist authority <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">even if that authority might have a point</a> and charge into battle anyhow with no plans and their biggest men at the front. It's worth observing that when the Gauls beat up the (ordinary) Romans, they tend to look messed up, but quite happy about it, as if they're just relieved to be liberated from the oppression of order. The Gauls export their particular brand of Chaos to the camps, eventually — a new centurion arrives to discover that no-one is in uniform and the soldiers, all bruised and missing teeth, have completely given up attacking the village and are now just hanging around enjoying food, drink, games and basically having a relaxed, good time.

Neither Order nor Chaos are portrayed as very nice.

Order (symbolized by a straight arrow) means that you have direction, but exclude some possibilities — in the worst case, all of them. A world gone too far in Chaos is one where shape cannot be maintained and horrible things will try to eat you. A world gone too far in law will eventually become a featureless white plane.

Ironically, the Chaos mages have (or had) a well-organized Empire, while the Order mages were generally either rebels or refugees for much of their history.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus">Illuminatus!</a></em> trilogy is largely about the battle between Chaos as good and Order as evil, but also suggests that Chaos is 'good' in this context because there is too much Order - too much Chaos is shown to be just as bad. One of the guiding principles of the Discordians (our Chaotic good guys) is that "imposition of order leads to escalation of chaos".
</li><li> Nonfiction example: Thomas Hobbes's <em>Leviathan</em> is very pro-Order, characterizing totalitarianism as the only alternative to "the war of all against all".
</li><li> A semi-viral unpublished novel called <em>The Cloven Accord</em> depicts Chaos as evil natural disaster-causing demons and Order as a mind-destroying cult. The happy medium, the Ilyarians, appears to be extremely metaphysical hedonism. Uniquely, all symbolism inherent in these concepts is helpfully listed at the back of the book.

This is demonstrated in parallel scenes where Obould subtly helps his generals plan for an assault with considerably more discipline and forsight than one would think an orc capable of(an attack he knew wouldn't happen, at that). Meanwhile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Grguch orders a raid on the orc's enemies without any planning at all</a>, despite, when he's called on it, displaying considerable understanding of battle planning; he knows what to do but doesn't do it as he considers order and discipline contrary to what he believes orcs should be. The twist in all this, however, is how these two are percieved by the heroes. The Companions of the Hall have been fighting orcs for as long as they can remember, and are forced to chose between assisting the creation of Obould's stable kingdom, which completely disrupts their perception of the natural order, or Grguch's chaos, which is normal for them, but in practice will involve a long conflict that will surely cost many more lives before it is resolved.

As a quirk of the way Milton wrote it, God is the stern version, while Lucifer decides in the first part to make the best of the bad situation he's been put in. It also points out Lucifer's hypocrisy. While he claims to stand for freedom, he very quickly becomes a despotic tyrant who rules Hell with an iron fist.

(The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho">Big Finish Doctor Who</a></em> arc "Key 2 Time" introduce the Grace, who seem to be Balance <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and are possibly worse than the Guardians put together</span>.)
<ul><li> The new series and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em> has The Trickster and The Pantheon of Discord. Though an opposite Order aligned group has not been shown. As they share some dialogue, some speculate that the two may be related, if not the same being.
</li><li> The Doctor himself is a benevolent force of chaos (just look at the effect he has on his companions' lives), and many of his enemies represent cruel order. The Daleks believe in cleansing the universe of all that does not meet their standards of purity and perfection (i.e. themselves), the Cybermen want to achieve harmony and survival by eliminating things like race, gender, and those untidy emotions (by making everyone a Cyberman), and the Master is a counterpart to the Doctor himself, but instead of merely wanting to experience the universe, he intends to <em>run</em> it.
<ul><li> The rest of the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, were "ancient, dusty senators" who were afraid of change and chaos. While they weren't his enemies for most of the original series (though they had their moments), they were nonetheless very law-bound and the Doctor was considered a dangerous renegade, who was tolerated because he occasionally came in handy.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em>, Hacker tries to claim that the role of the government is to do good and fight evil. Humphrey dismisses that notion with a dry laugh, and explains that the government is <em>actually</em> there to maintain order amid chaos.
</li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SisterSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SisterSister">Sister, Sister</a></em> had this! Tia and Tamera had very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingYinYang">different</a> personalities. Tia (order) was the neat, studious one, and Tamera (chaos) was the party girl.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> the Dominion's Founders viewed themselves as imposing order upon the chaotic galaxy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlurs">"solids"</a>. In Odo, this is tempered somewhat by his upbringing among humanoids, sending him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a>.
</li><li> A mostly subliminal but ever-present theme on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>, referenced most directly during a conversation between Varys and Littlefinger. Varys works for the good of the realm, and because of his powerless upbringing understands exactly what happens to the weak when there is no order or realm to protect them. Littlefinger, on the other hand, rebels against a system that would relegate him to a life as an irrelevant hedge lord, and sees chaos as a way to ensure his rise to power. Varys describes chaos as "a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all," while Littlefinger describes it as a ladder for the strong to climb. They're both right.
</li><li> A reoccurring theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowhereBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowhereBoys">Nowhere Boys</a></em>.
<ul><li> In Season 1, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is an entity known as the Restoring Demon, who is obsessed with restoring order whenever there's a magical disturbance.
</li><li> In the feature film <em>The Book of Shadows</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is a girl named Tegan, who is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revealed to be the personification of Chaos,</span> and wishes to take revenge on "Bear", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the personfication of Order.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMagicians2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMagicians2016">The Magicians</a></em> Umber and Ember are respectively gods of order and chaos. They joined forces in creating Fillory because their natures would balance out and allow for something greater than they could make on their own. So long as both remained in Fillory the world was stable. After Umber was driven out by the Beast there was nothing to stop Ember from indulging in his darker urges and bringing the entire world to ruin.
</li><li> The children's educational show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OddSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OddSquad">Odd Squad</a></em> pits kid secret agents and the orderly powers of Math against a grab-bag of (silly) chaos-spreading villains and freakish (goofy) phenomena.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a> song "Cygnus X-1: Book II" is about this. It details a war between Apollo (who brings wisdom and order) and Dionysus (of love and chaos) that decimates the human followers.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">    Myths &amp; Religion </div><div class="folder" id="folder8" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is a far more common dichotomy in ancient religions than concepts of "good vs. evil". Consider almost any ancient Pantheon (such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek</a> Gods) with flawed and often immoral dieties. They aren't exactly "good" in the sense of being moral and upright, but they represent elements of Order and human understanding and were almost always opposed to some rival group representing forces of Chaos and primordial nature. The Norse Gods fought the Frost Giants, the Olympian Gods defeated Giants and Typhon. Over time, and especially under the influence of medieval Christianity, Order became more associated with morality and the divine while Chaos became associated with evil, sin, (where applicable) the devil.
</li><li> This is the central tenet of Zoroastrianism. Followers worship Ahura-Mazda, the embodiment of truth, order and justice — and oppose chaos and disorder (also known as the Lie). One of the offshoot sects, called Zurvanism, names the Lie as Ahriman, the brother of Ahura-Mazda, and holds that the two are always in conflict over the spirits of mankind. The two are both the sons of Zurvan (aka Time).
</li><li> In Khemetic Orthodoxy, the god Set is considered to embody <em>constructive</em> chaos (the forest fire that allows new growth, for example) while the... <em>thing</em>... known as Isfet represents Chaos taken to its potentially universe-destroying extreme.
<ul><li> Order versus Chaos was the primary division in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology">Ancient Egyptian religion</a>, with the word <em>Ma'et</em> meaning not just order but also justice and rightness. The word <em>Isfet</em> meant both chaos and injustice. The Pharaoh was the "Lord of Ma'et" who upheld both social and cosmic order through his combined political and religious authority. Without this authority, the Egyptians believed that the primordial chaos which existed before Creation would overtake the world and dissolve everything.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Discordianism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Discordianism">Discordianism</a>. What else could be expected when the Goddess is Eris, Goddess of Chaos? (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Actually, Eris is Goddess of Strife</a>. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrincipiaDiscordia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrincipiaDiscordia">Principia Discordia</a></em> explains that the Greeks were somewhat "off" in their appraisal of Eris.) On the other hand, the Principia recognizes the difference between creative/destructive order and disorder, advocating the "good" version of each. Although it generally prefers the "disorderly" method, as Discordians believe the world is <em>far</em> too organized already.
</li><li> The Seelie and Unseelie courts of the Fae represent Order and Chaos (or Light and Darkness) respectively rather than Good and Evil, although that is how many modern fictional treatments align them. Both tend to be equally dangerous and unpredictable.
</li><li> Many creation myths start with a primordial sea of chaos, from which gods and creatures are born that eventually bring order to the chaos and create the earth.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taoism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taoism">Taoist</a> creation story from the <em>Zhuangzi</em> is about a chaotic, bag-shaped god named Hundun ('chaos'), who lived before the universe existed, and two emperors called Shu and Hu (Brief and Sudden). Hundun treated Shu and Hu kindly, so they decided to repay his kindness. "All men have seven openings so they can see, hear, eat, and breathe," they said (nostril, nostril, mouth, ear, ear, anus, the other one). "But Hundun has none. Let's try drilling some into him!" Every day they drilled another hole, and on the seventh day, Hundun died. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">People like the emperors</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">meddle with the primal world by trying to establish rules and regulations for it, thus killing it</a>.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> had three cosmic principles in its setting, especially shown in the <em>Werewolf</em> and <em>Mage</em> games: Dynamism/Wyld as Chaos, Stasis/Weaver as Order/Technology, and Entropy/Wyrm as corrupted destruction. <em>Werewolf</em> especially tended to picture Chaos as good, but mostly because it was the underdog of that fight. <em>Mage</em> had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">technomancers</a> of the Technocracy to act as Order, the insane Marauders as Chaos, and the diabolic Nephandi to serve as Entropy, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Characters</a> supposed to stand somewhere in between.
<ul><li> The cosmology in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> setting stressed the importance of the Unity of these three forces. When in balance, they feed into one other in a perfect harmony of creation, existence, and destruction leading to new creations. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> nature of the WoD is a result of that balance having been broken in favor of stasis and corruption.
</li><li> Incidentally, in the creation myth for <em>Werewolf</em>, the Wyrm was originally supposed to be the blessed end brought to all things that had fulfilled the purpose. Then the Weaver, who'd already been driven batshit crazy by trying to define the limitless Wyld, tried to define the Wyrm, which twisted it and turned its purpose towards unending corruption.
</li><li> The Were-Spider source book details their more minute distinctions of each force in the way they determine their Auspice. Each were-spider has what amounts to a primary alignment with one of the three forces, and a secondary allignment which determined how they expressed it. An entropic-dynamic character then, would thus be concerned with spreading/serving entropy and destruction in as choatic a manner as possible, whereas a static-dynamic character might be more intered in creating and preserving new works.
</li><li> It is not as hard-written into the story as in the other gamelines, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> has this kind of conflict too between the three core factions presented, with the Anarchs representing chaos, the Camarilla representing order and the Sabbat representing destruction, based on their general demeanours and goals. This in itself gets twisted around a through the individuals of each sect a lot, however, so it's definitely not as prominent as the more solid examples in the setting. The Camarilla is generally presented as the good guys in this gameline, with some Anarchs shining through occasionally, though it more leans towards being the lesser evil than actually being good.
</li></ul></li><li> In White Wolf's other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG">Tabletop RPG</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, traces of this are also present. The Wyld is a place instead of a force, but one that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> inhabit as the representatives of Chaos. Order is represented by the Sidereal Exalted and their Celestial Bureaucracy, as well as by the Realm of the Dragon Blooded.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has a similar system of moral alignment for characters that opposes Evil to Good, and Law to Chaos.
<ul><li> In the original game, there were only three alignments: Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic. Lawful was frequently equated with Good and Chaotic with Evil, so it's not much of a surprise that future editions expanded the system into the nine alignments that we know today — which many people <em>still</em> have arguments about, in large part because of the popularity of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti Heroes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti Villains</a> in fantasy fiction. <em>C'est la vie.</em>
<ul><li> Even in the original edition, the Monster Manual had creatures defined as "Chaotic but good" or "Lawful but evil". This most likely led to the two-axis alignments.
</li><li> The other alignments are also useful. A Dark Lord's just-following-orders minion or a heretic-burning priest is Lawful Evil (keep the rules whatever the cost to people.) A Thief character is Chaotic Good (screw the rules, be excellent to each other.)
</li><li> Fourth Edition pared it down to Lawful Good, Good, Unaligned, Evil, and Chaotic Evil. Players have hotly debated whether this means that Lawful Good is somehow "more good" than Chaotic Good, or whether goodness means being naturally chaotic. Wizards' own article on the subject appears <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20080602a">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. To summarize for those who don't want the link; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> are explicitly <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TheSameButMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TheSameButMore">The Same, but More</a> of Good and Evil. They simply represent very specific, focused views of good and evil — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> views law and order as being essential components to goodness, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> is so psychotic and self-absorbed it goes beyond what even Evil considers appropriate. An "Evil" character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">has standards and is usually rational about their goals</a>; a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a>" character has no standards and will do whatever they want to achieve their goals, which are often horrific even to Evil beings.
</li></ul></li><li> In the older editions, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Blood War</a> was a massive mashup between the demons and the devils on which kind of evil (pure rampaging destructive chaos vs brutal and cunning tyranny) should dominate the cosmos. Now its changed to war of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion">Evil Versus Oblivion</a> between the demons and the devils.Not only are the demons an infinite source of chaos and destruction but they cannot access the material plane until the devils are defeated. This makes the devils a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryEvil">Necessary Evil</a> and are the only thing keeping the endless hordes of demons from overwhelming the cosmos]]. This handily explains why the devils who use order have not defeated the devils and why the forces of good have not intervened to destroy evil it is impossible with the demons and destroying the devils means that death of everything.
</li><li> In 4e, the equivalent of the Blood War of prior editions is being fought between Bane, god of war and conquest, and Gruumsh, god of destruction and slaughter. Bane is a strategist who plays by the rules of war, while Gruumsh cares only for slaughter. Gruumsh covets Bane's position as god of war, and Bane uses the war with Gruumsh as a cover to make the other deities think he's distracted, occupied, and generally less competant than he actually is, though Gruumsh's unpredictability and bravado keeps the war much more even than Bane would like.
</li><li> In the Basic/Expert/etc variant of <em>D&amp;D</em>, the Sphere of Matter was generally affiliated with Law, and the Sphere of Energy with Chaos, with Time favoring Neutrality and Thought combining some of each. The four all generally team up to oppose the Sphere of Entropy, a nihilistic variant of Chaos that's looking to eliminate life of <em>any</em> alignment, however.
</li><li> Curiously, that's how things are in Normal <em>CD&amp;D</em> reality. In the alternate Nightmare reality, it's Chaos (a.k.a. Freedom) that's generally on the side of the angels, and Law (there called Stasis) that's considered a menace.
</li><li> The Neverwinter campaign setting can get like this with the right Game Master and playing the cynical side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>. One interpretation of the campaign is do you let Lord Neverember rule knowing that he might use Neverwinter as a stepping stone to conquer the northern lands, or do you dethrone him and risk the rioting that could cause Neverwinter to never recover from the disasters? Tyranny or anarchy, take your pick.
</li><li> Two products from Lamentations of the Flame Princess, publisher of "Old School Renaissance" supplements for older D&amp;D games, redefine Law and Chaos:
<ul><li> <em>Carcosa</em> defines Law as "sworn enemies the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Old Ones</a>" and Chaos as "servants and allies of the Old Ones".
</li><li> Their flagship RPG, <em>Lamentations of the Flame Princess: Weird Fantasy Role Playing</em> (whew!) defines Lawful beings as (oversimplifying a bit) conscious pawns in a cosmic plan, and Chaotic beings as those touched by magic, a random and amoral force that could overwhelm our so-called "reality" in the blink of an eye. Notably all Clerics must be Lawful, and all Magic Users and Elves must be Chaotic.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>: The conflict between White (the color of tradition, society, law and faith) and Red (the color of emotion, liberty, and impulsiveness) is at its heart the conflict between Order and Chaos. Since none of <em>MTG</em>'s colors are inherently good or evil, this can take many shapes over different stories, such as a heroic White society fighting back the chaos of Red barbarians and monsters that threatens to destroy it or Red freedom fighters and revolutionaries fighting against an oppressive and hierarchical White regime.
<ul><li> Red and White are not however mutually exclusive, and some of the Guilds from the Ravnica sets explore the mixing of the two colors in some interesting ways.
<ul><li> The Boros Guild, Red/White, is for instance extremely dedicated to promoting White ideals of justice, law and society, but rather than pursuing these goals stoically and/or emotionlessly like White tends to, they do so with a clearly Red passion, fervency and personal, emotional investment.
</li><li> This is taken a step further in the form of the Rakdos Guild, the Black (the color of selfishness, ambition and amorality) and Red guild; more or less a self-indulgent and frequently psychotically violent chaos incarnate. It is revealed that the entire reason the other nine Guilds allow the Rakdos to exist is to show to the non-guild citizens what a world without the guilds would be like. Furthermore, when a guild wants something done on a large scale that just isn't possible within their respected roles of the guildpact, they often commission the Rakdos to sow a little chaos and do it for them. Or, in the case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Dimir</a>, they set things up so the Rakdos take the blame.
</li></ul></li><li> The Kaladesh arc is a clear example of a story focusing on good Chaos versus evil Order, focusing on the chiefly Red-aligned Renegades fighting against the stifling, tyrannical order of the chiefly White Consulate.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> had both the Chaos gods and the Gods of Law, the later being obviously so obscure that they not only are barely mentioned, but pretty much absent from the main plot, although their followers are known to be extremistic. There's also several other gods who are either rather neutral, or that side against Chaos, but are not considered Gods of Order.
<ul><li> The Chaos Gods themselves do not simply represent Chaos; they represent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">corrupted Chaos</a>. All Warp gods are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">affected by the emotions of their worshippers</a> and all four Chaos gods personify, in part, something much more positive than their normal nature- Slaanesh is the God of Love, for instance, and Tzeentch the God of Hope. The reason they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> is largely because the Warhammer universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">is just that screwed up.</a> The fact that all the other factions are about as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> as each other is what makes Chaos the worst faction of the lot in the first place. Its not that there is no Good and Evil in this setting- it's that Evil exists, and it has <em>won</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> typically defines itself as Order vs. Chaos (or rather, Order vs. Disorder, seeing as how one of the factions in the universe is <em>called</em> Chaos). There is no real Good vs Evil. Although there are some individuals who could be considered good, as a whole the sides are basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">Bad vs</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">Worse</a></em>.
<ul><li> Normal racial divisions are the Imperium, Eldar, and Tau for Order, and Chaos, Dark Eldar, and Orks for Disorder. Necrons and Tyranids are both off to the side a bit, but as Necron lore becomes more developed, they seem to be leaning towards Order. Their goal is wiping out sentient life in order to <em>truly</em> starve the chaos gods.
</li><li> In the first Necrons codex, the C'tan are essentially the Gods of Order, as they're the complete antithesis of the Chaos Gods. The Chaos Gods exist in the Warp while the C'tan are wholly physical beings (well, energy beings, but they have no connection to Warp whatsoever) The Chaos Gods can substitute reality with their own, while the C'tan have mastery over the laws of physics, allowing both to do seemingly magical things. The followers of the Chaos Gods tend to end up controlled by their emotions and become more and more mutated until they turn into mindless Spawn, while the followers of the C'tan had their minds transferred into unchanging metal bodies and became the soulless and emotionless Necrons. The ultimate goal of the Chaos Gods is to consume the galaxy in chaos by turning it into a giant warp rift, while the ultimate goal of the C'tan is to seal off the warp, turning every sentient being into soulless cattle for them to feed on. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3tcve');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3tcve" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3tcve');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This angle was dropped in the second Necrons codex because Games Workshop came to the realisation that this made it very hard to give any meaningful character to the Necrons themselves and defined them solely by their relationship to the C'tan. </span>
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly to the C'tan mentioned above, in the Fantasy setting perfect order can be seen in the undead armies, the Vampire Counts and Tomb Kings, legions of mindless servants who thoughtlessly serve their masters in "the perfect, unending order of undeath."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Winterweir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Winterweir">Winterweir</a></em> has one of its main setting themes as the conflict between the Celestials (Order) and the Demons (Chaos) with neither side being especially good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL">FATAL</a></em>. It stresses that neither is actually related to good or evil. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">It also calls Order "ethical" and Chaos "unethical"</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignment</a> section. You may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticClapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticClapping">clap sarcastically</a> whenever you like.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> the Intersteller Wars are very much a war between "order" and "chaos" . The Vilani Empire is about ten thousand years old and has done almost nothing new in thousands of years. Yet at the same time it has highly refined all it's techniques and technology and has a political system designed to keep order. It is sometimes oppressive but it holds thousands of worlds together. The Terran Confederation has a more or less democratic order and it has large numbers of only half-controlled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidMerchant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidMerchant">Intrepid Merchants</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCossacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCossacks">Space Cossacks</a> pushing in to the Vilani Imperium.
<ul><li> By the time that most Traveller campaigns take place the interstellar wars are ancient history, the Terrans defeated the Vilani First Imperium and founded the Second Imperium which collapsed after less than 500 years. The Third Imperium is ruled by a blend of Vilani and <strike>Terrans</strike> Solomani and is a little more balanced than either of the last two.
</li><li> The Zhodani and Vargr are more extreme examples of Order versus Chaos. Zhodani nobles use their psionics to maintain a vaguely Orwellain police state while the Vargr have a extremely fragmented society where authority is based on "Charisma".
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EmpireOfThePetalThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EmpireOfThePetalThrone">Empire of the Petal Throne</a></em>, Order and Chaos are called Stability and Change, respectively. They are not exactly at war, but they are often opposed. Interestingly, they tend to mirror each other. There's a Stability Sun Deity and a Change Sun Deity, for example. Neither is necessarily good or evil.
</li><li> A Meta Game version is the Pink Mohawk vs the Black Trenchcoat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>, where Pink Mohawks represents chaotic shadowrunners who goes in with plenty of explosions and gunfire while Black Trenchcoat relies on cold calculation to complete the runs.

<ul><li> A theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em> - Inspector Javert positively fetishizes Order and Law above all else, while over the course of the story his country alternately suffers under tyranny and collapses into revolution around him, and he... obsesses over hunting down a single parole violator.

<ul><li> The main plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdventureQuestWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdventureQuestWorlds">AdventureQuest Worlds</a></em> is about Drakath, champion of chaos and the 13 lords of chaos. Order is less obvious, however the constant and stable conflict between good and evil seems to represent order (and considering that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a>, and the predictability of their fight going into something of a tradition, would represent order, an order that Drakath shattered when he came into the story.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> franchise, Solid Snake would do battle against both terrorists (representing chaos) <em>and</em> politicians (representing law), both of whom threatened to destroy the world with their war with each other.
<ul><li> On a more thematic note, the war between Big Boss and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zero</span> ultimately boils down to this. Big Boss's goal is to establish an anarchic perpetual battleground where soldiers are free to serve as mercenaries and do battle without allegiance to any government, ideology, or creed, whereas the latter hopes to unite the world under a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder">One World Order</a> government run by Big Brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> franchise, including both the books and video games, had three wars waged between the Northern Kingdoms (Neutral), the Nilfgaardian Empire (Order) and the Scoia'tael (Chaos). There is even a card game based after those three wars, titled "Gwent"!
<ul><li> Geralt of Rivia, on the other hand, did his best to avoid their three wars with each other, remaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> to the best of his abilities, just to focus on two things: Killing monsters for profit, and rescuing his adoptive daughter, Ciri.
</li></ul></li><li> The virtue system in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Serpents Isle</a></em> is quite different from past games. Unlike the Britannia virtues, based on Infinity, Ophidian virtues are based on Order and Chaos. The Virtues of Order are Logic, Discipline, and Ethicality. The Virtues of Chaos are Emotion, Enthusiasm, and Tolerance.
<ul><li> However, unlike the virtues of Britannia, Ophidian virtues are not good by themselves and must be practiced with its opposite counterpart to achieve balance, otherwise, wrongs are committed, called Banes. The Banes of Order are Ruthlessness (Logic without Emotion), Apathy (Discipline without Enthusiasm), and Prejudice (Ethicality without Tolerance). The Banes of Chaos are Insanity (Emotion without Logic), Wantonness (Enthusiasm without Discipline), and Anarchy (Tolerance without Ethicality). The Order and Chaos counterparts combined together form the Principles of Rationality (Logic and Emotion), Dedication (Discipline and Enthusiasm), and Harmony (Ethicality and Tolerance).
</li><li> Halfway through the game, the Banes of Chaos possess three major party members, which in turn annihilate the three major cities, which were guilty of practicing the Banes of Order. The three main cities were also notable in that they practiced bastardized forms of the three major Britannia Principles, Truth, Love, and Courage. Monitor practiced a bastardized version of Courage and the Bane of Apathy. With their courage just being merely words and not true actions, they were wiped out by the Bane of Wantonness when he sent goblin hordes to attack Monitor. Fawn, worshipped Beauty, a bastardized version of Love, which caused them to commit the Bane of Prejudice to anything ugly. The Bane of Insanity killed the city with plague and flayed the city's priestess alive (the Avatar restores her however). Moonshade (a bastardized version of Britannia's Moonglow, the city of Honesty) is a city of half-truths where the truth is only good when convienant. This leads them to commit the Bane of Ruthlessness. When the Bane of Anarachy arrived, he had the town's inhabitants kill eachother.

Although generally both sides try to leave each other alone, sometimes someone gets it into their head that their side is the superior.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a></em> games have the Hammerites, a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">militant</a> group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templars</a>, as Order, and the Pagans, a demon-worshipping underground <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">Cult</a> of shamans and hippies, as Chaos. Neither are portrayed as particularly nice. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">protagonist</a>, interestingly, could be considered a representation of balance: he's a thief, but his livelihood hinges pretty heavily on the institutions of the society he lives in, and he frequently steps in to keep things from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">going all to hell</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> has this as its central conflict. Pick a game out of the series and despite ever-changing setpieces, backdrops and actors, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">the script remains the same</a>. Unlike most examples neither side is shown to be better than the other, often becoming two types of evil depending on the game (Neutral is generally treated better and is the canon ending in all instances of direct continuations), but just has different trade offs for humanity and demons. Order tends to result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill">the eradication of all independent thought</a> and the reduction of reality to a vast machine dedicated to the worship of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">YHVH</a>, whilst Chaos tends to spawn a twisted world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> and endless war.
<ul><li> It returned as a major mechanic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiStrangeJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiStrangeJourney">Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey</a></em>, up to and including several bonuses (extra attack combos, price discounts when recruiting demons) and losses (failed negotiations, harder to contact successfully a demon of opposite alignment) depending upon your stance on Order and Chaos.
</li><li> SMT is an interesting example in that although neutrality is often presented as canon, it is also often presented as not being that great of a choice, which ends up making the choice of endings seem like a 'shades of shit' kind of deal. Strange Journey in particular shows that allowing humanity to go on as it is could be a bad idea...
</li><li> Spinoff series generally portray the alignments in a much more positive manner. One example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidouKuzunohaVsKingAbaddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidouKuzunohaVsKingAbaddon">Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon</a></em>, where it's not them being forced to pick a side but rather how Raidou wishes to live his life.

</li><li> If the words of a certain traitorous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">bishounen</a> priest are any indication, this may well turn out to be the most primal conflict in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> series. There are many ways one could wax <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxlosophicNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxlosophicNarration">fauxlosophic</a> about this, but so far most of the writing on the wall seems to be margin notes. For instance, the conflict that created the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">Suiko-verse</a> was between two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">embodiments of protection and destruction</a>. Refreshingly, the series chastises both extremes, showing the horrors of "true Order" (dharma, in the words of the aforementioned priest) at least as often as the horrors of "true Chaos."
<ul><li> Indeed, the Empire of Holy Harmonia, the possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game series, lives up to its name as the embodiment of strict order. On the other hand, recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> Yuber is Chaos's standard bearer (oddly enough, the two actually end up on the same side in at least one war).
<ul><li> It's also implied that Pesmerga, whose sole purpose in life seems to be to eliminate Yuber, is Yuber's counterpart on the side of Order. The two look very similar (including their all-black wardrobes), have swords with the same name, and despite their human appearance are apparently immortal demons of some sort.
</li></ul></li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenTierkreis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenTierkreis">Suikoden Tierkreis</a></em> isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame">connected to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">the main series</a>, it pits the hero against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">The Order Of The One True Way</a>, an empire with clear parallels to Harmonia, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">nastier</a> and with plenty of horror.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>, this is heavily present (though at times significantly played-with) with the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">divine beings</a>. To note:
<ul><li> The primary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth">Creation Myth</a> for most religions of Tamriel generally follows a pattern that, in the pre-creation "void", there were two opposing primordial forces - Stasis (Order) and Change (Chaos). A few of the religions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">anthropomorphize</a> these forces into beings most commonly known as Anu and Padomay, respectively. The interplay between these two forces led to Creation, sometimes anthropomorphized as the female entity "Nir". Nir favored Anu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy">which angered Padomay</a>. Padomay killed Nir and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">shattered the twelve worlds</a> she gave birth to. Anu then wounded Padomay, presuming him dead. Anu salvaged the pieces of the twelve worlds to create one world: Nirn. Padomay returned and wounded Anu, seeking to destroy Nirn. Anu then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">pulled Padomay and himself outside of time</a>, ending Padomay's threat to creation "forever". From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiecesOfGod">intermingling of their spilled blood</a> came the "et'Ada", or "original spirits", who would go on to become either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">the Aedra or the Daedra</a> depending on their actions during creation. (Some myths state that the Aedra come from the mixed blood of Anu and Padomay, while the Daedra come purely from the blood of Padomay).
</li><li> One of these spirits, said to have been "begat" by Sithis (the embodiment of chaos and, for lack of a better term, Padomay's "spirit"), was Lorkhan (aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">Shor, Shezarr, Shep, Lorkhaj, etc.</a>). Depending on the version of the myth, he convinced/tricked some of the other et'Ada into helping him create the mortal plane, known as Mundus, to permanently disrupt the "stasis" of pre-creation with "chaos." (The races of Mer, or Elves, generally believe this was a cruel trick that robbed their ancestors of their pre-creation divinity while the races of Men believe it was a good thing.) Those et'Ada who sacrificed large parts of their being to create Mundus became known as the Aedra, while those that did not participate became the Daedra. For his treachery, the Aedra "killed" Lorkhan and tore out his "divine center" (heart), which they cast down into the mortal world he helped to create.
</li><li> The Aedra, meaning "Our Ancestors" in the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalTongue">Aldmeri language</a>, sacrificed a large portion of their divine power in order to create the mortal world. It is said that the et'Ada who would become the Aedra formed from the intermingled blood of Anu and Padomay, giving them some traits of both Order and Chaos. Meanwhile, the Daedra, meaning "Not Our Ancestors," did not sacrifice any of their power during the creation of Mundus and remain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">truly immortal</a>. The et'Ada who would become the Daedra are said to have formed exclusively from the blood of Padomay, giving them purely Chaotic traits. (Though even this is heavily played with, as two of the Daedric Princes, Jyggalag and Peryite, both govern over spheres which contain elements of <em>Order</em>.)
</li><li> This is heavily played up in some of the religions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">races of Mer (Elves)</a>, <em>especially</em> the Altmer (High Elves). According to Altmer religious beliefs, the creation of Mundus was seen as an act of malevolence as it forced them to experience mortal suffering, loss, and death while removing their spirits from a place of pre-creation divinity. While most are content to toil in this mortal "prison" with "more limitations than not," some extremists, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">the Thalmor</a>, actively seek to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">undo creation</a></em> to return to that state of pre-creation divinity. According to their beliefs, mankind was made up from the "weakest souls" by Lorkhan to spread Sithis (Chaos) "into every corner," ensuring that there could never be the "stasis" (Order) of pre-creation again. However, they believe that not just the <em>existence</em> of mankind, but the existence of the <em>possibility</em> of mankind keeps them trapped in Mundus. Essentially, the Altmer are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence">oppressed not just by the existence of mankind, but the possibility of mankind's existence</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>'s <em>Shivering Isles</em> expansion is based around this trope. Sheogorath, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Daedric Prince of Madness</a> will periodically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">transform into his original form as Jyggalag, the Daedric Prince of Order, and level the Shivering Isles - Sheogorath's realm of madness, creativity, and free will</span>. The main quest of the expansion is to bring an end to this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">Vicious Cycle</a> once and for all.
</li></ul></li><li> The main villains of the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Anachronox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Anachronox">Anachronox</a></em> are revealed to be a species devoted to Chaos, who were sent back to a former universe by a species devoted to Order — though not much is made of this, since the sequel was never made.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> has the Order Realm/Seido, and the Chaos Realm, who are constantly at war with each other.
<ul><li> Plus, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> character from Seido and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid">Chaotic Stupid</a> character from Chaosrealm. They're arch enemies.
</li><li> Tyrant conquerors Onaga and Shao Khan are associated with order and chaos respectively and are favored by the members of the realm of equivalent alignment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonMaster">Dungeon Master</a></em> features a group of heroes sent on a quest by Lord Order to defeat Lord Chaos. Complete the quest as stated and Lord Order thanks you, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> then murders you. To win, you have to defeat them both by merging them back into the one human they were originally created from.</span>
</li><li> Very much like the example above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheFaeryTaleAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheFaeryTaleAdventure">Faery Tale Adventure 2: Halls of the Dead</a></em> evokes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality">"too much of either is bad"</a> version. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is ostensibly the personification of Chaos, but destroying him will only serve to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">allow Order to achieve a perfectly ordered state by encasing the entire universe in lifeless crystal. Destroying Order likewise makes the world uninhabitable, for the opposite reason. The correct solution is to unify them, bringing harmony to the world again.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline">Warhammer Online</a>: Age of Reckoning</em> had two factions: Order and Destruction (since one of the races is Chaos). With Empire, Dwarves and High Elves on one side and Chaos, Greenskins and Dark Elves on the other. However, it has somewhat been criticised for making the Order side a bit too 'Good', although that could just be in comparison to the pure baby-murdering evil that is Destruction.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em>, it becomes clear that this is the true conflict, and the idea that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a> is some sort of in-universe ideal decay that has happened over millennia. Evidence of this is found in the fact that OTHER demons will chastize demons they see getting "too evil", e.g. Raspberyl's declaring Mao's intent to blow up the Earth, an act for scum. Also in the first game Etna insists on teaching Laharl kindness in her own warped demon way, and this trait was something she admired in his father.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The fourth has this <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a> (though it's worth noting that Chaos hates "Life" and Order equally, and Life feels the same about Chaos and "Death.") Order is borderline good, but a spell to protect against that alignment references "what the self-righteous are capable of." Chaos . . . is just evil. Sorry.
</li><li> In the fifth and sixth games, Order is represented by Asha the creator goddess and her six children, as well as by the Necropolis faction who worship Asha as the 'Spider Aspect', while Chaos is represented by Asha's brother Urgash and the Inferno faction, which consists of the Demons that Urgash created to wage war on his sister.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a>: Shadow of Chernobyl</em> has the very aptly named Duty vs. Freedom, Duty being a highly disciplined paramilitary organization that believes the world needs to be protected from the Zone, and Freedom being a loosely run band of stoners and anarchists who believe the Zone's gifts should be shared with the entire world.
</li><li> The famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Green Rocks</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, are called the <em>Chaos</em> Emeralds. They wasted a perfectly bland plot in the scrapped game <em>Sonic X-Treme</em>, which would have featured the Rings of <em>Order</em>.
</li><li> This is one of the pairs of faiths in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordsOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordsOfMagic">Lords of Magic</a></em>. Order is represented by the standard High Middle Ages style humans, Chaos is represented by barbarians.
</li><li> This is the most important conflict of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeptHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeptHeaven">Dept. Heaven</a></em> series, where order is represented by the gods of Asgard and chaos by the Underworld and its demons. Both sides are far and away on the "extreme" end of what these things represent, and woe betide anyone who gets in the middle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality">Gray-and-Grey Morality</a> also applies; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series is a proxy of the gods, and the most messianic character who's appeared thus far is a demon.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivieraThePromisedLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivieraThePromisedLand">Riviera: The Promised Land</a></em> has its hero Ein find a happy medium by telling both sides of the conflict where they can stick it if they're going to keep recklessly endangering the lives of ordinary mortal people in neutral territory for their own selfish warring.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion">Yggdra Union</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazeUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazeUnion">Blaze Union</a></em> both deal with mortal affairs more than the huge conflict going on in the background, but they go a long way towards establishing the powers that be on both sides as incredibly callous. The antagonist of these games was born to be one of Asgard's soldiers, and was punished horribly for refusing to go to war and asserting his free will despite being what was considered a subhuman class, then exiled to a mortal world—and then completely ignored, even as he started manipulating events on that world for the sake of revenge. (These games, by the way, are the one with the messianic demon.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsInTheNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsInTheNightmare">Knights in the Nightmare</a></em> explains that the conflict between the forces of order and chaos has been so bad that a lot of worlds have neutral arbitrators to keep their fighting from damaging mortal worlds.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoUniverse">LEGO Universe</a></em> doesn't exactly have "order," but Imagination is a channeled chaos, pitted against the completely unfettered Maelstrom. The distinction is similar to that between building a tower of Legos out of bricks from a dozen different sets, and smashing the tower to bits.
</li><li> Though it (possibly) started out as an Good vs. Evil affair, the revelation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Calibur's</a></em> true intent in <em>SoulCalibur IV</em> (to force the world into a state of peace and safety by crystallizing all its inhabitants) causes its conflict with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Soul Edge</a> to fall into this (because it slips into a "no matter who wins, we all lose" scenario). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Fan theory</a> suggests that this happened over the course of the series, rather than Soul Calibur having such a twisted objective from the start.
<ul><li> The closest we have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> on the matter is that Soul Calibur was <em>originally</em> just as evil as Soul Edge, from whence it came, because Algol's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> gave its spirit no moral compass besides a directive to destroy Soul Edge at all costs. The sword's evil was eventually quieted and purged by its keepers (who are all long dead now), and is speculated to have reawakened after Soul Calibur was temporarily trapped within Soul Edge. Unlike a lot of video game examples of this trope, merging the swords together is <em>a very bad idea</em>, creating a godlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that is pure evil.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> plays the conflict between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer">Master Computer</a> GLaDOS and whimsical AI sidekick Wheatley as less Evil vs. Good and more as the aspect of game theory that pits a perfectly logical, experienced player against a completely random one who has no idea what he's doing, what the rules are, what the win condition is, etcetera. The random player can win not because he's good at the game, but because he's so unpredictable that the logical player cannot anticipate his moves. In fact, later in the game, Wheatley does a better job of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being an actual antagonist</span> than GLaDOS ever did. Interestingly, the randomness doesn't always work in his favour because, well, it's random. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even his "triumph" would have meant that <em>everyone</em> lost by <em>dying</em>, instead of just him losing by being deposed.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TCTRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TCTRPG">The Colour Tuesday</a></em>, the Others keep everything in a state of mind controlled order so as to prey on humans. This makes the rebellious Alex a perfect candidate for trying to break the Others' control.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, the Titans aren't so much "good" as "ordered", and do some pretty morally questionable things in order to keep the balance. On the opposite side is the Burning Legion, which holds it as their sacred mission to bring chaos and destruction to all worlds.
<ul><li> To demonstrate, the Titans created the Halls of Origination which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">functionally destroys the world</a> by resetting it back to when the Titans first finished making/modifying it. From Algalon's words, it's to be used whenever things go wrong with the Titans plans and seemingly every world visited by the Titans has one.
</li><li> The Bronze Dragonflight acts much like the Titans, maintaining the "order" of the timelines. This also means ensuring some pretty horrible events happen, as the effects of them <em>not</em> happening might be worse. Their nemesis, the Infinite Dragonflight, wishes to change the timelines greatly to achieve some unknown goal. They do so by disrupting that "order", threatening to destabilize the entirety of time.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby">Kirby</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Meta Knight</a> often fall into this, with the former being carefree and chaotic (often causing a lot of trouble) and the latter imposing extreme order (often in an effort to counteract that trouble).
</li><li> This is the entire foundation of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em>, with the Goddess of Harmony (Cosmos) vs the God of Discord (Chaos).
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> game, Sovereign claims that the Reapers "impose order on the chaos of organic evolution". Two games later, a downed Reaper says something similar, arguing to Shepard that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> harvesting organics and uploading them into new Reaper shells</span> is the only way to "preserve" them. Otherwise, they will eventually create synthetics that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">have the power to destroy them.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This turns out to be the purpose of the unthinkably old AI overseeing the whole cycle.</span>

While there are few sympathetic Zamorakian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a>, and most heroes are Saradominists, the distinction isn't clear cut, as groups like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">HAM</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">White Knights</a> can attest to.

</li><li> A theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em>. The game is a very complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityKitchenSink">Morality Kitchen Sink</a>, but this is an underlying theme of the series. The conflict manifests itself primarily represented in series protagonist, Ragna the Bloodedge and his younger brother/rival, Jin Kisaragi being chaos and order respectively.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Catherine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Catherine">Catherine</a></em>, being a spinoff of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em>, has this as a running theme but in a much more downplayed scope compared to the parent series, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">Ms. Exposition</a> Trisha even brings up this trope on one occasion.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em>: the long conflict between Assassins and Templars is essentially a question of whether the world needs more freedom or more control. The games are generally in favor of the Assassins, though Shaun (an Assassin) doesn't consider them to be "heroes" since they still kill people to accomplish their goals. Most Templars aren't portrayed in a favorable light, especially in the second game. The third game brings both sides closer together on the morality scale. William tells Desmond that both sides have made attempts throughout history to join together, but ultimately their ideologies are diametrically opposed.
<ul><li> Furthermore, the Templars create chaos in their attempts to impose order whereas Assassins contain chaos by minimizing violence, stabilizing threats and building institutions and support systems. So no one side is pure Order or pure Chaos. They even have the same goal, a peaceful world, but disagree on how to get there.
</li></ul></li><li> Very much the name of the game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChaosReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChaosReborn">Chaos Reborn</a></em>, where wizards with reality-warping powers battle each other for claims of godhood, and affect the balance of the entire universe around them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BladeAndSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BladeAndSoul">Blade &amp; Soul</a></em> has this theme running through its main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">Player Versus Player</a> factions. The Cerulean Order is a well-intentioned dictatorship which believes society functions best when people are assigned to the role most suited to their natural talents and skill set. The Crimson Legion advocates complete social mobility and believes any form of stable government will naturally lead towards corruption and tyranny.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> <em>V</em>, you can choose one of three mutually exclusive ideologies as your Civ progresses into the modern age. Freedom (Chaos) represents capitalism, is all about empowering the individual, and is great for giving smaller, more peaceful Civs a much needed leg-up by giving bonuses to culture, happiness, tourism and diplomacy, and also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperweaponSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperweaponSurprise">gives some defensive bonuses to the military</a>. Order (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">you'll never guess</a>) represents Marxist-Communism, works by empowering the state, and is good for sprawling (but not necessarily aggressive) empires with lots of industrial buildings as it gives bonuses to food, production and population, and gives them out on a per-city basis. Autocracy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalNeutral">Omnicidal Neutral</a>), representing Fascism, is all about empowering the great leader at the very top and giving huge bonuses to all things military, allowing you to build armies faster, more cheaply, in greater numbers and even improving the individual combat power of units. Civs tend to get along better with other Civs of the same ideology and some even have preferred ideologies: for example, the Americans and French prefer Freedom, the Chinese prefer Order, and the Germans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis">unfortunately</a> prefer Autocracy.
</li><li> The choices in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PapersPlease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PapersPlease">Papers, Please</a></em> side you with the government or the revolutionaries. It's up to interpretation on how good or evil either group is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">You can also decide to flee from both of them.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em>, the Ethos system features, amongst others, the Collectivist-Individualist dichotomy. The exact ideology represented by any given stance on the dichotomy is left intentionally vague for roleplaying purposes, but from what can be gathered, Collectivists favour autocratic governments and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">don't take happiness penalties from slavery</a> and Individualists favour democracies and personal liberty, gaining bonuses to energy production.
<div class="indent"><strong>Fanatic Collectivist description</strong>: "The purpose of the individual is simple; strengthen the collective. To enter the blackness of space we move as one, and we shall not be weakened by wanton separatism." <br/><strong>Fanatic Individualist description</strong>: "We must recognise that 'society' is but a convenient fiction, the by-product of individuals working toward parallel, overlapping, and contradictory goals. As it should be."
</div></li><li> The trope forms the main backbone of the conflict between Symmetra (Order) and Lucio (Chaos) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em>. Symmetra believed that order has to be upheld to create a better community. Unfortunately, due to her upbringing and working for Vishkar Corporation, widely believed to be an evil, corrupt company, some tends to miss that she's not a big fan of their underhanded tactics, only interested with order and was led to believe that Vishkar is doing things for an eventual greater good, the restoration of order. On the other hand, Lucio was a victim of Vishkar's attempt to impose their order (with a little help from Symmetra), and as a believer of people's freedom, he rose up by stealing Vishkar's technology and using it against them, granting freedom to the oppressed people and allowing him to do a dual-job between an international DJ by day, a freedom fighter by night. Symmetra obviously do not get along with Lucio, her doubts with Vishkar aside, she still saw him as no better than a thief, a street rat that rose to fame with dubious, unorderly manners and he should at least return the technology he stole, while Lucio justifies himself with how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Vishkar was asking for it for oppressing his people first</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood">it's for the oppressed people that needs freedom</a> (which was dubbed by Symmetra as 'anarchy') and generally, he is not aware of Symmetra's personal doubts and thinks that she's just the same as the other corrupt Vishkar guys that oppressed his people, therefore, she has no validities in chastising him when she's showing blind obedience to what he thinks to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Corrupt</a> company.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT3">SWAT 3</a></em> briefly touches on this with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">recurring euphemism</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">deadly</a> or otherwise, depending on how you play) of "bringing order to chaos" - i.e. removing, whether by arresting or neutralizing, any armed and antagonistic individuals who are currently threatening the safety and well-being of your squad of SWAT officers or any civilians.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildStar">WildStar</a></em>, this is ultimately the conflict between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Dominion</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores">The Exiles</a>; Those that join and become citizens of the Dominion and obeys their laws are granted rights like education. If you don't obey, you get swept aside. The Exiles consist of those who got "Swept aside" and are trying to live their own lives free, but they've become criminals just to survive.
</li><li> From <em>Melee</em> onward, the Master and Crazy Hands of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> series imply this (Master with Order, Crazy with Chaos).

<ul><li> The concepts of Master &amp; Crazy Hands compared to that of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Galeem &amp; Dharkon</span> shows both sides of both ways Order &amp; Chaos can be taken.

Interestingly, the KND could themselves be highly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>-ish, erasing the memories of their own operatives once they got "too old".
</li><li> To quote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a>,</em> "The world has almost completely fallen into order. It's up to us to restore chaos." Eris, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">goddess of chaos</a>, is a recurring character. The one time she was ever calm, life was becoming so routine that it might as well not exist. However, her plans are as chaotic as she is, varying from pranks to antagonizing people to massive upheaval of all life, and involving everything from brainwashing dolls to giant flying babies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">giant alien zombie lobsters</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux">Æon Flux</a></em> is all about order vs. chaos to the point of being a gender-flipped version of Moorcock's Cornelius stories, with Aeon as chaos/Jerry and Trevor as order/Miss Brunner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> has a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a>, as Hexadecimal is The Queen of Chaos and Megabyte represents Order in the form of tyranny. The one time that Hexadecimal executed a successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>, she snapped her fingers and undid the damage because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring">Victory Is Boring</a>. Megabyte, with the same opportunity, imposed an eternal dystopia.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4u7qq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4u7qq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4u7qq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Dot saw a vision of it and prevented it from happening.</span> Interestingly, Hexadecimal was never portrayed as Capital E evil in the same sense as Megabyte, but more as a force of nature with a dark sense of humor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, Bart is Chaos while Lisa is Order. In one of the Simpsons comics (Issue 111) the kids even represented them.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a>,</em> Equinox has the powers of both Order and Chaos Magic. Eventually it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">the Lords of Order and the Lords of Chaos</a> made a deal, tasking him to keep balance between the two forces</span>. Finding this impossible, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">decided to restart the universe from scratch.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> is <em>weird</em> about this trope.
<ul><li> In place of standard Order, it has "Harmony," which emphasizes unity and compromise rather than strict discipline. Opposing it is "Disharmony," which is occasionally referred to as Chaos and emphasizes arbitrariness and strife. Discord, its primary representative, acts according to random whims.
<ul><li> Fittingly, this means that the Mane Six have actually battled against both Chaotic foes, such as Discord or the magic-eating monster Tirek, and Orderly ones, such as the tyrannical King Sombra and Starlight Glimmer.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode "Feeling Pinkie Keen" has Twilight Sparkle as Order and Pinkie Pie as Chaos. Twilight is the Element of Magic, and firmly believes that everything has an explanation, even magic (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">since works in ways you direct it in, and creates the expected effect</a>). Pinkie is the Element of Laughter, and despite being an earth pony, is seemingly able to bend space and glimpse the future due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>.
</li><li> The 2-part opening episode of season 5 is based on this, with the villainess, the aforementioned Starlight Glimmer, having determined that even so minor a form of chaos as "ponies having individual talents and specialties" is an evil she cannot tolerate. Leading her to strip all ponies under her rule of their cutie marks and with these, their special talents. Naturally, the Mane Six have to stop her and give them all back.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>. Candace <em>thinks</em> of herself as representing order but her own behavior is at least as chaotic as the boys. Played straighter with the regimented OWCA versus the whimsically evil Doofenshmitrz.
</li><li> As revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>: <em>Beginnings</em>, there were two major spirits: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsGood">Raava</a> the order spirit, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">Vaatu</a> the chaos spirit. Each 10,000 years, they wrestle around, the former keeping the latter in line just in time for the Harmonic Convergence. But it was thanks to Wan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> accidentally releasing Vaatu</span> that the balance of the world gets out of control. So he spends the rest of his life working with Raava to fix what he accidentally did.
<ul><li> Season three has the Red Lotus, a splinter group of the White Lotus who are essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BombThrowingAnarchists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BombThrowingAnarchists">anarcho-primitivists</a> that revered Vaatu and wish to destroy all governments and establish a new, more spiritual world. In the words of their leader, "The natural order is disorder". Season 4's main villain is Kuvira's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Earth Empire</a>, a force of absolute order.
</li><li> Depending on the region, the game Pai Sho, which both Lotus groups draw their names from, is considered either a fast-paced and exciting game, like the Red Lotus, or one about strategy and waiting for the proper time to make a move, like the Earth Empire (and as presented with Asami and Bolin, order beats chaos almost every time).
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is the conflict in physics between the theories of General Relativity, which describes an orderly and predictable universe, but is only applicable to large scales, and Quantum Mechanics, which describes a chaotic, random, near-nonsensical universe, but is only applicable to small scales. Both theories are correct, even though they contradict each other. The purpose of a Unified Field Theory would be to resolve these conflicts and unite both theories.
</li><li> Real life asymmetric/guerilla wars tend to be this trope. Although the chaos is usually less of a choice than in most fiction, and more of a necessity, born from a lack of options.
</li><li> Judging vs. Perceiving preference pair in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MyersBriggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MyersBriggs">MyersBriggs</a> tests. Judgers prefer more order in interactions and frequently lay out plans, Perceivers have more flexible rules and do not keep plans as much.
</li><li> The order-chaos dynamic is what the dimensions on the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_compass">political compass<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> amount to, designed in order to illustrate a slightly more complex graph of political ideologies compared to the traditional left-right spectrum. The X-axis measures the extent to which economic enterprise is controlled (far left is extreme central market planning, far right is extreme unregulated market capitalism), the Y-axis measures the extent to which moral norms are enforced (the far top is extreme authoritarian social control, the far bottom is extreme atomization of social mores).
