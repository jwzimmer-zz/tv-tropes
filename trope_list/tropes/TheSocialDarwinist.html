</div></div><p>The Social Darwinist is someone who believes that the Darwinian theory of evolution  i.e. "survival of the fittest" to oversimplify it  should be applied to people, and sometimes entire societies or nations. Or they may just advocate ideas that are associated with this, though not invoking evolution (Darwinian or not) itself. To the Social Darwinist, all life is a struggle for survival in which the strongest naturally prosper at the expense of the weak  and it is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">right</a></em> and <em>natural</em> that they should do so because that's just the way things are, and/or natural law is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">Above Good and Evil</a>. Such characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalPositionFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalPositionFallacy">rarely concede</a> that their chances for survival may have started higher than others due to reasons such as inherited wealth or social prestige. They typically state that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveBecomeComplacent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveBecomeComplacent">We Have Become Complacent</a> and stupid, and want to remove weakness and stupidity from society. It may seem to some that because humans aren't currently having wars/disaster and humans aren't endangered as a species that evolution in humans has ceased altogether.

</p><p>Fictional Social Darwinists generally come in six major flavors:
</p><ol><li> <strong>The Straw Meritocrat</strong>: Basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilist</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist">Hollywood Atheist</a> without the overt craziness. This first type believes that the scientific absolutism of natural selection puts them in zero accountability to God, the State, or any other moral code. People who rise to the top in the human environment aka <em>society</em>, by whatever means, can consider themselves superior against others  even going so far as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad">praise the evils of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">over-ambitiousness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuysFinishLast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuysFinishLast">condemn kind behavior</a>. Frequently, this will be held even in settings where the people in charge are clearly getting there through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">nepotism</a>, or otherwise as a result of luck and privilege. Despite it being nothing more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion">Theme Park Version</a>, this philosophy is still frequently held by both fictional characters and quite a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> "successful" people. This is often coupled with the "logic" that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning">since they are in charge they must necessarily deserve to be there.</a>
</li><li> <strong>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Nazi by Any Other Name</a></strong>: The second type is a racist or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldYourHippogriffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldYourHippogriffs">species</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">ist</a> who believes that their race is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace">Master Race</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies">Superior Species</a>, and by extension, the only one fit to live and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram">reproduce</a> in the world/galaxy/universe, and uses this belief as a justification for subjugating, enslaving, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">just plain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe">getting rid</a> of those that they consider "inferior" (as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazis</a> did). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Scary Dogmatic Aliens</a> are very likely to have this mindset, as is any society <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">modeled upon the Nazis</a>. Occasionally also held by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSupremacist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSupremacist">super-people</a>.
</li><li> <strong>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">Evilutionary Biologist</a></strong>: The third type is an evolutionary biologist or anyone else who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">mistaken ideas</a> about how evolution works "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">for the good of the species</a>," and in order to help it out or not "get in its way," anyone with a birth defect or who is in any other way "weak" in this villain's eyes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor">deserves to die</a> to keep the gene pool strong. Many such characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">hope to create</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman">Transhuman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm">Ultimate Life Form</a>. This type is also what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> had in mind with Aktion T-4, the Lebensborn program, and their wider eugenics policies.
</li><li> <strong>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJustifications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJustifications">Jerk Justifier</a></strong>: The fourth type is simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">selfish</a> and uses Social Darwinism as just a justification for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">sociopathic</a> behavior. This character may not actually believe it and may not even care, but finds Social Darwinism to be a convenient justification or excuse for the way they were going to behave anyway. Often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite">Straw Hypocrite</a>, especially if he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">coward</a> who will immediately resort to "un-Darwinist" cheating if he's ever exposed as inferior himself.
</li><li> <strong>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">Struggler</a></strong>: The fifth type believes that competition, suffering, and struggle make the individual, and possibly society as a whole, superior. They tend to believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVirtues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVirtues">Evil Virtues</a> like cunning, ruthlessness, opportunism, and the ability to endure and survive by any means necessary, and tend to have a cynical view of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">the world as a hard, harsh place</a> and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HobbesWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HobbesWasRight">Hobbes Was Right</a>; they may also/instead suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">Evil Cannot Comprehend Good</a> and thus undervalue non-Social Darwinist virtues like kindness or pacifism. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller">A Real Man Is a Killer</a> logic often falls into this category, as does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious">War Is Glorious</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> held to this view as well. Differs from the first in that they don't necessarily believe that those at the top always deserve it; they tend to take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> view of things, and the most sincere of this kind do not believe the struggle ever ends and are never <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrites</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser">if they end up on the losing side</a>, they will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity">accept their fate with dignity</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle">though usually not quietly</a>).
</li><li> <strong>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness">Weakness Punisher</a></strong>: The sixth type deliberately seeks out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakWilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakWilled">weak</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruptible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruptible">people</a> to ruin their lives. They usually use a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">manipulation</a> to let these people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeeknessIsWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeeknessIsWeakness">embarrass themselves</a>, often enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantHumiliationJustAddYouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantHumiliationJustAddYouTube">online</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">bully</a> their victims or let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies">other people</a> do the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">bullying</a> for them.

However, this has disastrous consequences when the Resistance releases bioweapon that decimates the Viltrumites, leaving only a few hundred survivors that tries to keep the death toll a secret to keep the Empire intact.

Grubs who show ingenuity and cleverness learn how to collect and hoard food for themselves, while those who don't starve before they can mature. This system has made the race masters of strategy and politics, but it has also made them incredibly greedy by nature, and terrified of death.

This does ensure that drow who survive are more dangerous, particularly to each other. Realistic natural selection might well have either wiped them out altogether or forced them to cooperate in a more rational manner. Lolth, their patron deity, tells them to knock it off whenever they fall below a certain point in population. And yes, this makes the drow a race that officially survives on Deus Ex Machina.
</li><li> The <em>Book Of Exalted Deeds</em> (a book about good characters) has a passage about this mentality, saying "The idea that creatures too weak to better themselves deserve their low position is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">hallmark of evil dogma.</a>" and continuing with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">Good characters reject this notion completely</a>, recognizing that most poor and needy people are the victims of circumstance, not of their own weakness or failings."

Thus, if the sapient races are to survive until the Spring, the weak must be culled from the herd.

Naturally, they get whipped by the "inferiors", who recognize that you can still be of use in combat over the age of 30. The story of the Clan invasion could be a deconstruction of the whole thing. While their rituals and codes of honor helped perfect the Clans' fighting technique, they forgot many of the pragmatic realities of war. Meanwhile, the Inner Sphere realms were all too familiar with them, thanks to their constant bickering, possessive, petty leaders.

An unusual example is his nemesis Urza, a <em>protagonist</em> eugenicist; calling him "heroic" would admittedly be a stretch. Urza is such a Darwinist that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually <em>sides with Phyrexia</em> after spending millennia trying to defeat it when he actually visits the place, since Phyrexia is everything he ever wanted as an artificer and as a Social Darwinist.</span> Vorinclex from New Phyrexia is a social Darwinist as well, to the point of objecting to society at all. The only thing that matters is that ability to kill those weaker. Green and Black, despite being enemy colours, love social Darwinism.

</li><li> Two examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lunars have been known to apply this to the societies, both human and beastman, that they set up. Generally, if a nation they've been shepherding is going well, they'll stop giving it covert (or, in some cases, overt) assistance and watch to see what happens. Oh, and for the setting in question, they're good guys, who made colossal sacrifices to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> from wiping out reality 800 years ago.
</li><li> Cecelyne, one of the Yozis, was responsible for the principle of law in Creation, but it's suggested her ideas, even as a Primordial, were a bit... off. Now that she's been made into a Yozi, her idea of "law" has twisted to "whatever benefits the strong so that they rule over or drive out the weak." Oh, and her chosen are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a> caste. Be quite afraid.
</li></ul></li><li> Both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Imperium</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> view all other races and each other as less evolved and inferior. The Orks also do this with their culture based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">warfare</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">toughness</a>.
<ul><li> Dark Eldar are almost exactly the same as the Orks, except replace size and toughness with skill and cunning. Dark Eldar society requires all of it's members to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastards</a>, or they'll be backstabbed and betrayed by even more ambitious and cunning rivals and underlings. As such, Dark Eldar kabal society is constantly shifting around as warriors, dracons, and archons climb up the ladder... or get kicked off it.
</li><li> Chaos worshipers. One of their mottos is "purge the weak".
</li><li> There exists a school of thought within the Imperial Inquisition called the Istvaanians. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em> notes that they may be the oldest school of thought in the Inquisition, with their ideas going all the way back to the dawn of mankind. They believe that the Imperium grows stronger through conflict. If a certain Imperial sector is currently enjoying peace, they might stir up a conflict, just to make sure the populace are on their toes. They may also set up a "crucible of fire" to ensure that only the strong survive. They will monitor any conflicts they start for particularly strong, cunning, and/or ruthless candidates to strengthen the Imperium. Behold, the only people in the setting who would argue that the Imperium's problem is that it's <em>not fighting enough wars</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em> has two factions who act like this.

</li><li> The eponymous creatures from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em> have definite shades of this, in that their leadership is decided by challenges. These can be non-violent challenges but rarely are. The cake is taken by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Get of Fenris tribe</a>, who think being tougher than everyone else is the only worthwhile goal in life.
<ul><li> The Ratkin (wererats) and Ajaba (werehyenas) are extreme social Darwinists. The former were tasked with killing humans when the human population grew too large, and the latter kill humans who are old, sick, or weak.
</li></ul></li><li> Also sharing the universe of the previous entry are the Lasombra: one of many vampire clans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>. Unlike the werewolves, they completely revel in promoting social Darwinism. The hold to it is so strong that the clan's ultimate goal is creating a world purged of the weak and owned solely by the strong. They're not averse to bringing about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth">Hell on Earth</a> to accomplish that either. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Gehenna</a>, this mentality finally bit the Lasombra in the butt; centuries of backstabbing resulted in their numbers too depleted to maintain autonomy as a Clan, just like Sparta in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> below.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em> the cult of the Fanged Mother on Venus believes that the strong should dominate the weak and the only ethical thing for the strong to do is to cull the weak to sate the Fanged Mother's thirst. Needless to say, most Venusians aren't happy with a death cult turning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Venus</a> into any more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> suggests that DMs who want to make the Summer Court more morally grey include elements of this trope. Such an interpretation, however, is still a logical extension of Summer's canonical traits: only letting physical strong warriors have leadership positions, referring to low-ranked members derogatorily, drawing on powers in combat that harm <em>themselves</em> in addition to the enemy "[because] they will be able to fight through" the pain... You get the idea.

<ul><li> Andrew Ryan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em> has shades of this, what with his version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged">Ayn Rand's Objectivism</a>. He even builds an underwater utopia so that the weak do not keep the strong down. Someone still has to scrub the toilets in Rapture; even if Ryan brought down only the best and the brightest people that fit in with his ideology, people who were once captains of industry back on land were no better than average there and were disgruntled when they had to work menial jobs that someone's gotta do. On the other hand, Ryan had a fairly broad definition of "strong." For example, he met one of his best friends, Bill McDonough, when the man was installing the plumbing in Ryan's apartment. Ryan had only paid for tin pipes, but McDonough was using brass ones and paying the difference out of his own pocket, as he took a great sense of pride in making sure none of his work ever leaked. The next day, Ryan hired him as his general contractor and made sure to bring him down to Rapture when the city was built.

<ul><li> Legate Lanius, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> of Caesar, is this to a much more brutal extent. If he rules the Legion and wins the Battle of Hoover Dam, he makes Vegas into a twisted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Warrior Heaven</a> where he puts the world to the sword. In his mind, violence will set the world free, breaking the weak and letting the strong truly thrive. He even uses you as proof, stating that being shot and left for dead forced you to become strong.
</li><li> Caesar's Legion in general operate on a belief in survival through personal strength. In Lonesome Road, if you tell Ulysses that you killed Caesar, he'll respond that by the logic of the Legion, he wasn't strong enough to be a leader if he couldn't even defend himself.
</li><li> The Legion also dislikes medical technology, because it allows the sick and weak to survive when they don't deserve to. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Caesar readily abandons this belief when he finds out he has a brain tumor, and secretly keeps an Auto-Doc around to treat it</a>.

</li><li> This is the prevailing philosophy of the city of Magnagora in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lusternia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lusternia">Lusternia</a></em>. As the bastion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">The Taint</a> (essentially a combo platter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower">nuclear power</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftianSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftianSuperpower">creepily visceral body horror</a>), they believe themselves to be genetically superior to all other civilizations. Their most prosperous race (the Viscanti) inbreeds extensively to maintain its "purity", and they have no moral qualms about attacking, enslaving, and eating so-called lesser beings. They also encourage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">backstabbing, assassination and double-dealing</a> in their aristocracy, reasoning that the survivors of any civil war will be stronger and cleverer than those that failed to defend against them.
</li><li> The Tevinter Imperium runs on this principle according to Fenris from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>. Only mages can become nobility there, and only the strongest mages become the movers and shakers in the Imperium. In practice, this means that <em>every</em> magister is a Blood Mage since blood magic is too powerful an advantage to pass up. Any mage that didn't use blood magic would quickly be enslaved by another mage with fewer qualms.
<ul><li> In the next game we find out it's a little more complicated than that. In the highest levels of power blood magic actually marks you as <em>weak</em>, a confession you couldn't make it on your own. They also have the usual political games of any legislative body, and individualistic backstabbers like Fenris' former master tend to suck at alliances and coalition building. Of the three magisters in the game, only one is a blood mage.
</li></ul></li><li> Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> is fond of this trope. According to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Javik</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, the Prothean civilization worked on this principle, calling it "The Cosmic Imperative", and it combines the natural and social forms. That is, they believed weaker species' societies would only get in the way of the strong and should be crushed. They were willing to uplift lesser races, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">only as long as they had something to offer as slaves to the Prothean Empire</a>; the "worthless" races were destroyed. For the Prothean client races, it's suggested that much of their cultural identity was wiped out as far as the official record since said person notes that Prothean wasn't just the name of his species or empire but applied to any citizen, Prothean or non, within that empire. Thus if your species joined the Empire, you would stop being, say... an earthling and instead be a Prothean.
<ul><li> It's even claimed that if another civilization was powerful enough to have defeated the Prothean Empire, they would have willingly subjugated themselves because obviously that civilization would have been superior. How true this is is very much open for debate, as it never happened until the Reapers came and wiped them out.
</li><li> The Reapers' effectiveness against the Protheans compared to the next cycle that Humans were part of is the logical conclusion of such social Darwinism (and is in-line with the true gist of Darwin's theory): the danger of homogeneity. Because the cycle that had Humans, Turians, Salarians, Asari, and countless other sentient starfaring species as neighbors in a galactic community instead of masters and clients like in the Prothean times allowed a heterogeneity of culture, science, philosophy, and strategy that might have been an advantage against the Reapers. A strong species or civilization doesn't have an optimization of traits for some arbitrary qualifier, but a diversity of traits for reality; so when a change happens, the largest array of potential adaptations to that change are available to ensure the species/civilization survives in some form. The extent of this advantage is unclear because the real difference between the current and previous Reaper invasion is the presence of Shepard, without whom the Citadel and thus the war would have been lost before anyone knew what was happening.
</li><li> The Reapers are also this to an extent in that they like strong races because strong races make strong Reapers. Lesser races are still useful... until they're not.
</li><li> Warlord Okeer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> also has elements of this. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">krogan</a> scientist, a member of a species that's been subjected to a genetic weapon that makes only one in every thousand births viable. He thinks <em>this is still too many</em>, as every krogan baby is then "coddled" and viewed as precious when they should be testing their mettle as warriors.

The modern world is way more populated than the one he used to rule and thus the worth of the individual human has fallen drastically. Thus he plans to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spill the contents of the incomplete Grail onto the world; by his logic, those who survive the ensuing apocalypse will be strong and "worthy" enough of his rulership</span>. This may be justified in the terms of the Nasuverse's backstory: the human race has gone <em>waaaaay</em> downhill since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeOfMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeOfMyth">the days of Uruk</a>. It's an established fact in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> that ancient Babylonians were something of a precursor race with nuclear missiles and spaceships and all kinds of crazy stuff. Gil's reasoning is that mankind's decline is due to the population explosion decreasing the "worth" of a single human life, and given all the crazy supernatural laws that the Nasuverse runs on, <em>he might actually be right about this</em>.

Acknowledging that humans are at their core a social species, his belief is that through the conflicts caused by individuals holding different beliefs, stronger bonds, and connections are created as ideas are challenged and developed, and thus humanity advances and avoids the twin dangers of "stupidity and stagnation."

Amongst other parts, the video points out that Darwin's descriptive terms for evolution in <em>On the Origin of Species</em> were used prescriptively by Spencer to create this trope, as well as by Galton to create the field of eugenics. He notes that Spencer's ideas actually predated Darwin's work, along with those of Thomas Malthus. Both claimed aid to the poor should be stopped as it would only cause overpopulation (Malthus added a theological side since he was a minister). Malthus claimed this population growth would outstrip food supplies (which has been disproven). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a> and other left-wing radicals who held much the opposite views also praised evolution though, feeling it vindicated their views.

However, he also notes that views of eugenicists varied widely, while it also still exists (contrary to popular belief-mainly used against prisoners or trans people). While he is a Marxist, Olly also admits some Marxists endorsed eugenics as well.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FriedrichNietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> in a nutshell. Keep in mind that Nietzsche, although the stereotypical Social Darwinist who called for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUbermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUbermensch">The Übermensch</a> to inherit the Earth, criticized Darwin's actual theory of natural selection. Darwin's actual theory was trial and error, determining who reproduces and who goes extinct via who reproduces more, not by any individual's power or skill. This to Nietzsche encouraged overpopulation and democracy, which he disdained. Nietzsche was also "The Struggler" type of Social Darwinist, in that his philosophy essentially boiled down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">suffering tragedy and the inherent nihilism of life</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiNihilist">but overcoming it by rejecting society and creating your own.</a>
</li><li> Believe it or not, Social Darwinist thinking was actually a <em>mainstream</em> view <em>everywhere</em> in Europe and the Americas <a class="urllink" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-us-history/period-6/apush-gilded-age/a/social-darwinism-in-the-gilded-age">in the late 1800s and early 1900s.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It was used to justify blatant imperialism, ruthless <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism, and to oppose any social programs and the workers' movement. Needless to say, it was <a class="urllink" href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-the-pseudoscience-of-social-darwinism-nearly-destro-1308329496">involved in thoughts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of "culling the unfit". Of all countries, even <em>Sweden</em> had its own eugenics program. The forced sterilization of women deemed "unfit" continued <a class="urllink" href="https://www.economist.com/node/155244">until 1974.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> famously used social Darwinism to justify various atrocities and as part of their propaganda. A quote attributed to Hitler was: "Success is the sole earthly judge of right and wrong." It even carried over to Hitler's government style, deliberately promoting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction">Jurisdiction Friction</a> in the belief that "the best" faction would ultimately implement policy on the ground, but it actually led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FascistButInefficient">serious efficiency problems</a> down the line. Of course, there is no guarantee that the most radical course of action (which usually won out, as his sycophant subordinates jumped over themselves trying to outdo each other and curry the dictator's favor) is by default the most effective one. He carried this to its logical conclusion when he lost: because Germany was defeated, his enemies - primarily the Slavic peoples, as well as Anglo-Americans - had proved themselves the superior race, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">and so he tried to destroy Germany</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">itself</a></em> in the last months of the war, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">as the Germanic peoples had proved themselves "unworthy."</a> Thankfully, saner heads prevailed and his orders weren't carried out.
</li><li> Sparta.
<ul><li> Eugenics was already practiced (before the advent of biological science) by leaving defective and sick babies to die. Think of your childhood consisting of pain (no changing clothes, fighting against your best friends, usually to death, you are encouraged to steal, but if you get caught you were punished...not for stealing, but for getting caught, and finally being dumped in the wilderness, etc). Adulthood was extremely military, and the extreme views of Spartan society have given them an almost mythical reputation now in history. Ultimately it undid them because they were limited in number to at most a few thousand of them and the loss of even a few hundred warriors was a major blow to them. So they quickly reached their maximum extent. "Oliganthropia" (i.e. "having few people") was the perennial issue facing the Spartans since only an elite few were the famed warriors (Spartiates) caused over time due to the aforementioned eugenicist infanticide, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> and constant war. Over the centuries, their numbers declined from about 8,000 to around 1,000-certainly no "survival of the fittest" then.
</li><li> The other reason Sparta collapsed was much simpler. Their society's very survival depended upon a reliable supply of slave labor. If there was a slave revolt (which happened <em>quite</em> frequently), Spartan soldiers would need to quickly abandon the battlefield and rush back home to quell it, or else their state would swiftly have collapsed.
</li><li> They were also technologically and socially stagnant. When the Thebans and later Maceonians adopted new battlefield tactics designed to counter the Spartans' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> (the <em>only</em> soldiers they bothered producing were heavy infantry), the Spartans couldn't deal with it and suffered a crippling military loss they never recovered from (the earlier battles with Athenians also showed some problems, but they had managed to recover in that case). After the eventual Roman conquest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a> became little more than a tourist attraction.
</li><li> The main problem was actually due to the Spartans being a living fossil. The polis was an early attempt to solve the tensions present in all Greek societies at the time (nobility versus commoners), by effectively making all citizens noblemen. However, there was very little flexibility for the case of new types of tension, and once money economy, despite all attempts, became important, the Spartan law that citizenship requires property translated into them bleeding citizens at a steady rate with hardly any connection to wars.
</li></ul></li><li> The Vitality Curve strategy in corporation HR, or "rank and yank", where 10% of the work force is sacked every year to get rid of the worst-performing employees (similar to what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GlengarryGlenRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GlengarryGlenRoss">Mitch &amp; Murray</a> tried to do). In reality, after a couple of years, you tend to run out of genuinely incompetent staff and are left with what essentially becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyEliteCannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyEliteCannonFodder">Surprisingly Elite Cannon Fodder</a>, and continuing this policy leads to unnecessary corporate politicking and significant problems with workplace morale and performance instead of improvements in the workforce. Former Enron COO (later CEO) Jeff Skilling was a huge believer in this system and implemented it at Enron. This ended up creating a culture where presenting an appearance of success became far more important than actually serving the best interests of the company. Skilling would also infamously declare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardDawkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardDawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>' <em>The Selfish Gene</em> to be his favorite book and the foundation of his management style (which caused a horrified Dawkins to publicly state that not only did Dawkins not endorse such behavior but that Skilling had completely missed the point of the book).
</li><li> There are a few hundred editions of old medical, anthropological, and sociological treatises and textbooks (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">debunked, naturally, since the 1930s or so</a>) that held that Europeans constituted some sort of 'Master Race' and that this was all 'proved' by their economic development (Industrial Revolution and all that) and success in declaring protectorates over areas like Sub-Saharan Africa where there were few-to-no ethnic Europeans. <em>Which</em> European 'race' was <em>the</em> Master Race, on the other hand, was up for spirited debate (for instance most Germans backed the "Nordic" race, "Italians backed the "Alpine" race unsurprisingly, etc.).
</li><li> Eric Harris, one of the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine</a> shooters, believed wholeheartedly in this trope, going so far as to write the words "Natural Selection" on a t-shirt he wore the day of the massacre.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japan</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of Social Darwinism. Japan, even before the Westernization campaigns started by Emperor Meiji, was always an honor-based society wherein achievement for one's family was everything. Even before Darwin, in the Japanese mindset, failure was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heresy">heresy</a>, punishable by suicide. The introduction of Western philosophy during Meiji rule, including that of Social Darwinism, provided additional justification. At first, Japan tried to exercise its achievement need towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial conquest</a>, which of course failed, leading to almost the entire military killing themselves. After World War II, they tried in other fields, such as science, technology, and economics, investing massively into their industrial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">keiretsu</a>. The reason for Japan being a deconstruction is that, despite their status as a First World country, their obsession with work, achievement, and intelligence had led to <em>catastrophic population decline</em>, from people killing themselves via overwork (also known as <em>karoshi</em>) to everyone no longer marrying and having children because they must dedicate themselves to work and achievement. In the modern day, Japan has a negative birth rate, in contrast to the Darwinian ideal of high achievers having more babies. Basically, the Japanese are not having children because they view themselves as <em>not worthy enough</em>.
</li><li> It must be born in mind that, while views such as the above have been defended based on Darwinism, so has virtually every idea. Just five years after Darwin published <em>On the Origin of Species</em> for instance, his own co-discoverer Alfred Russell Wallace argued evolution led to the more <em>altruistic</em> people surviving in the long run, as groups which had such traits were fitter than those without them. Modern evolutionary biologists have said the same. Wallace felt that humanity would eventually achieve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia">utopia</a> where everyone was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheFutureHumansWillBeOneRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheFutureHumansWillBeOneRace">one race</a> and no need existed for government or laws. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Anarchism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Anarchism">Anarchists</a> argued the same thing— in fact, among the earliest uses for "Social Darwinism" was by an anarchist essay asserting the idea, in stark contrast with how the term is now used. Liberal reformers, socialists, and others naturally got in on the game too, claiming evolution supported their ideas (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Marx</a> praised <em>Origin</em>, for one). It was only much later that the phrase had become associated with a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">might makes right</a>" philosophy and similar ideas. There is still a great diversity in terms of what people will claim the implications for evolution on society are, and it's frequently nothing like this trope.
</li><li> This can, unfortunately, still be seen in our modern political discourse, though the less said about it the better. In some cases, it's ironically pushed by people who <em>reject</em> evolution and view Darwin as evil, despite the very opposite being claimed by them (for instance the US religious right opposes evolution, yet has advocated the kind of laissez-faire capitalism often associated with Social Darwinism as well).
</li><li> As this very page shows, there is a lot of diversity in what's called "Social Darwinism"-with six major varieties, how coherent can it be? This has been a criticism of the term in real life as well. Many scholars no longer feel that it's ever been a single, coherent philosophy. The modern idea that it was is traceable to the American historian Richard Hofstadter in his 1944 book <em>Social Darwinism in American Thought, 1860-1915</em>. However, even he had to distinguish between "individualist" and "collectivist" Social Darwinism. Most historians in the time since however feel that Hofstadter pretty much invented the idea himself since none of the people he labeled "Social Darwinists" called themselves that, nor did they share enough views to really identify a clear common philosophy (even with competing strains). At best, it could be described as just "the application of Darwinism to society" which is really vague and doesn't say much. Like the above examples show, there are many possible ways this could be done (or claimed at least) not just those which we usually think of when the term has been used. Keep in mind that Social Darwinism has always been pseudoscience so it makes sense that its actual philosophy would be very inconsistent.
</li><li> The infamous neo-Nazi leader Ben Klassen essentially advocated the genocide of all non-white "mud races" so their lands could be used as <em>lebensraum</em> for "Nature's Finest", who he considered to be white people. He also founded a pseudo-religious organization called the Church of the Creator dedicated to his crackpot ideas.
</li><li> An important reality that further debunks this line of thinking is the fact that everyone isn't on an even playing field. For example, a nineteenth-century capitalist who may have believed in this idea isn't more successful because he is naturally smarter or stronger then the workers he exploits, he is most likely (there are of course some historical exceptions) wealthier and more powerful then they are because he was born to a wealthy and powerful family, a circumstance that afforded him education and opportunities that were unavailable to your average person, giving him a massive advantage that he didn't earn and that has nothing to do with his genes. In fact, some socialists used Darwinism to argue against capitalism on exactly that basis-it rewarded people not from fitness, but being lucky enough to be born in the upper class. The people there were also frequently occupied with things that could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich">hardly be</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">termed "useful"</a>. Further, they often argued working-class people were inherently more fit since they had produced everything, in contrast with capitalists simply reaping the profits, and were thus parasites in their view.
