After hearing this, Guts eventually gets fed up with Griffith looking down on him and up and leaves the Hawks, ironically having to defeat Griffith after he was acting very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">yandere-ish</a> toward him. The sad part in this was that Guts was going to come back someday in the hopes that he and Griffith would become true friends. That would never to be.
</li><li> Oh Casca. She went through so much for the sake of the Hawks (having the responsibilities as the second-in-command, being the only woman in an all-male environment, putting up with sexism and threats of sexual violence routinely, etc.) and asked for very little in return. She only really wanted some emotional recognition from the two men that she held dearest to her: Guts and Griffith. But they seemed to be too preoccupied with their own dreams and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">"feelings" toward one another</a> than with her, and she eventually allowed her feelings to be known.

<ul><li> Goku is seen as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer">Hope Bringer</a> among his family and friends. Outside that circle, however, no one knows or cares about him. This is mostly because Goku purposely keeps himself under the radar, preferring to live a peaceful and calm life when fighting is not involved. However, Goku has helped a number of people and he was actually known as the person who beat King Piccolo and his son, saving the world (King Furry tried to give Goku a medal for defeating King Piccolo, but an oblivious Goku left before he could). He is also a winner of the World Martial Arts Tournament and runner-up two years in a row with matches that are consider legendary. Also, thanks to Babidi's magic, the entire world saw him fight Buu at Super Saiyan 3 and cheered him on. Yet, when Goku asked for help to form the Spirit Bomb to kill Buu, only a few people cared. Only the people who knew Goku throughout his life or met him personally offered anything. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> averts this, however, with Mr. Satan giving him the reward money he got as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">world savior</a> as his way of thanking him as well as keeping him quiet about things. While widely considered to be non-canon and to have no bearing on <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> finally does away with this and has the world acknowledge Goku as a hero, with there being a statue of him still standing at the site of the World Tournament 100 years after he was last seen.
</li><li> Despite being a god and overseeing of the entire northern galaxy, King Kai gets little respect from Goku and the other lower Kais. Goku treats King Kai like an old buddy. He eats all his food and often uses his planet for training without any regard towards him. To the other lower Kais, he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> because he's dead.

Subverted with the guild girls who actually give out the quests; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">they are well aware of how dangerous goblins are</a> since they see unprepared young parties go out to fight them and never come back. Therefore, they love Goblin Slayer since he's the only one doing anything about it, and snub the higher-level adventurers. The commonfolk who usually have to deal with the goblins are fond of him, too. However, Goblin Slayer himself doesn't care what anybody thinks of him as long as he gets to kill goblins.

Most of this is because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Newtype</a> and the Federation leadership doesn't trust them as far as they can throw them.

Asuna is a particularly annoying example, downplaying his accomplishments constantly while giving her classmates credit for lesser achievements. (Even acting at multiple points as if she were a stronger combatant, despite her power being awakened by him in the first place.) He finally gets the respect he deserves (from the nations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand">Magicus Mundus</a>, at least) after he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stopped Fate from erasing everyone</span>. And although a lot of his students still call him Negi-bozu, it seems to have become a friendly nickname rather than a deliberate show of disrespect.

Even Ashura underestimated him, so much so that at one moment, he/she says that he is not a problem at all. This is someone saves Koji's life so many time during the series, and is ridiculously helpful during Koji's fight against the mechabeast.

Tetsuya and the Getter team laughed, followed by the former admitting that their plan worked thanks to him. Boss smiled, stating it was about time someone acknowledged his talent.

It's granted that they ARE pirates, and most of the time the people don't even know it was them in the first place, and if they do it's usually because of their wanted posters. Chopper, in particular, when he gets his first wanted poster, is appalled to find that the Marines have classed him as the Straw Hats' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">pet</a>, and given him a bounty of <em>50</em>. (Even currently, it's only 100, and that's just because the bounties of the whole crew went up.) To compare, the second-lowest bounty in the crew at the time was <em>16,000,000</em>. Though when they get to Fishman Island <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Fishman Princes are looking for them, not to arrest them, to deliver a message from their mutual friend Jinbe and invite them back to the Royal Castle</span>. This all changes after the Impel Down Arc, where Luffy and his crew are either respected or <em>feared</em>, thanks to the incident in Sabaody Archipelago, the mass-breakout in Impel Down - the World Government's "unbreakable" prison, and Luffy taking part in the War in Marineford just a day after. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Two years later</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">entire legends spread around them</a> implying their ruthlessness, and Luffy being barely human.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo">Oreimo</a></em>, Kyousuke goes through great lengths to help Kirino's secret hobby become accepted by their father and her best friend Ayase. He also helps her to meet Saori and Kuroneko, which she forms a strong bond with and would never have met on her own. And even though he didn't really want to, he plays the gal games and eroge that Kirino dumps on him. Despite this and more, she still treats him like dirt for the most part.

You would think that a guy who won against 36 Gym Leaders in 5 regions and got up into at least the top 10 in the league challenges that followed, <em>beat</em> the Orange League champion, defeated the Battle Frontier, has befriended and caught numerous Pokemon over his years of traveling, won numerous conventional battles and even those he lost against ended up respecting his talent, has helped out countless people who were in trouble, and on at least a dozen occasions saved the world from the wrath of legendary Pokemon would get a little recognition now and again. It seems extremely implausible that he hasn't at least gotten a few reporters asking for an interview or entered a town or two that has heard about him. It doesn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe">how good Ash, along with how strong his Pikachu is, depends entirely on what the plot requires.</a> He might vary from coming off as an average trainer, simply because if he was kept consistent after each season there would be no tension. The only humans who ever really respected him were Gary after the two reconciled, his mother, and Prof. Oak. Pokémon themselves, however, respect him immensely, with many Legendaries regarding him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">Chosen One</a> at various points (particularly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000">the second film</a> and <em>Best Wishes</em>).

<ul><li> Minako/Sailor Venus. She's the Sailor Senshi active for the most time, stops bank robbers in her free time and single-handedly freed London from Dark Kingdom monsters (where the other Sailor Senshi were nearly killed many times, once being saved by Venus who had just returned from London). Comes second season and we find out that Sailor Venus has apparently been overshadowed by Sailor Moon and forgotten. At least in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> she's still famous... It didn't help that her Sailor V persona was presumed dead after one mission back in England.
<ul><li> Subtler, but she gets the same treatment in the Dream Arc of the manga... From her own teammates, who are so in awe of the Outers they apparently forgot her role in training them in the first arc, rescuing them from the Black Moon in the second, and generally putting a performance as good or better than the Outers in the third, something she eventually call them out on-before going on what under the circumstances is a suicide mission just to prove she still has it. What makes this <em>really</em> tragic is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">the others actually admire and respect her far more than she realizes</a>, to the point they don't realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">how broken she actually is</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">under her smile</a> until she suddenly starts shouting at them, and what Minako mistook for awe at the Outers was the result of them assuming that, after they had all been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a> at the start of the arc, she had recovered her powers before them (she was still depowered) and were trying to tell her that the Outers, being better than them, could help her save the day much better than they could.
</li></ul></li><li> Usagi throughout the entire first season and parts of the second. As Sailor Moon she's mocked and put down constantly by Luna and Sailor Mars.

She also have the least experience out of all the Sailor Soldiers since she is a reborn princess and not a warrior, so her being scared while fighting makes a lot of sense. Things actually get <em>worse</em> for her after they learn she's the Moon Princess and is often compared to her past self. It does gets better in later seasons, but by then, Sailor Uranus and Neptune are the ones constantly putting her down and calling her naive, despite being right more often than them. And she gets almost no respect from her future child, Chibiusa, who she saved on countless occasions (though Chibiusa <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">does get better later on</a>). At least the public loves her.

The media tend to focus on Nodoka who, despite her accomplishments in the middle school tournament the previous year, isn't as good as Saki, and there are those who would claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs">Nodoka's breasts are the only reason she gets attention</a>. In the first round of the quarterfinals of the tournament, one reporter gets chewed out by his colleague for even considering giving an interview to Yuuki, and he's told that Nagano is a weak prefecture.

<ul><li> Jonouchi has had several amazing victories over cheaters, put up a tremendous fight against the duelists he lost against, and helped save the world several times. Yet, everyone treats him like a joke or has no idea who he is. He even defeated Marik before anyone else did (taking a direct hit from Ra, something even <em>he</em> doesn't know how he survived), he technically lost the duel because he succumbed to exhaustion at the last second from the shadow game, but he was literally one move away from ending the arc on his own. (That may have been the one time Kaiba said anything about him may have come close to a compliment.) He does get a <em>little</em> respect, just not much that he knows about, with Pegasus himself in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> saying in a flashback scene that he considered Jonouchi the third-best duelist he had encountered. (Pegasus invented the game, so a guy can't help but trust his opinion here.)
</li><li> Kuriboh. <em>Seriously</em>. From Kaiba onwards, it's hard to find a rival, antagonist, or villain who is willing to describe the little guy with an adjective better than "worthless", despite the fact that, time and time again, it and its many variations have protected its owners from monsters with godlike powers, saving them and the world as a whole from certain doom each time. (The worst part about this is, some of these folks use monsters that are, if you compare the numbers, even weaker than a Kuriboh, showing incredible hypocrisy in their words.)

</li><li> The heroic El Hombre got hit with this in both his civilian and hero identities. As community organizer Esteban Hidalgo, he never felt accepted by the Latino community no matter how much money and time he spent improving the neighborhood. As El Hombre, he was disappointed to learn that he was the least popular member of Honor Guard — and disgusted with himself to realize that he actually <em>cared</em> about that.

His joy is short-lived when everyone assumes that the robber must have been caught anyway, simply because the heroes always win. This makes him realize that his victory isn't worth anything if no one knows about his deed.

However, he had the love and adoration of (bare minimum) 98% of mankind, it's just that the tiny amount of people who criticized and didn't appreciate him over the years slowly drove him nuts out of sheer pettiness.

During the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>, Maria Hill, presumably acting with Tony Stark's approval, actually authorized plans to use deadly force on Victor Mancha and send the alien members of the group to a brutal prison.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>. He often shows remarkable skills, regularly saves the day or is an important part in it...

<ul><li> It's made even worse when you take into account the fact that for every adventure that his Uncle Scrooge undertakes Donald is right there with him doing just as much heavylifting, if not more, and furthermore tends to have just as many of his own amazing adventures apart from his uncle. Then also note that for all the times he's called lazy it's noted time and again that Donald has had multiple jobs and is constantly shown to be looking for a new one. Admittedly, it is something of a flaw that he can't hold down a job, but the fact remains that he still always attempts to find another one. Not for himself, but for the three children at home that he's responsible for. This can't be seen as anything less than admirable (something the Raider, a <em>villain</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">points out</a> in the "Might and Power" of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">Paperinik New Adventures</a></em> relaunch.

</li><li> Amazingly enough, Paperinik himself gets hit with it from time to time. It usually takes the form of a new superhero showing up and the people of Duckburg worshipping him and forgetting Paperinik because the new guy is cooler (never mind that the new hero is invariably revealed as a screw-up or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">a supervillain</a> trying to make Paperinik retire in disgust at Duckburg's people), but in one rather annoying occasion it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">because he had become too good and the people of Duckburg were envious</a>, and in another being mocked by most of the city for a single error. This one resulted in Paperinik actually considering retiring out of spite, and it's shown that in an alternate timeline he did just that when Scrooge, demoralized after Emil Eagle accidentally destroyed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOneDime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOneDime">#1 Dime</a>, decided to retire and give him his money and financial empire and wouldn't go back being a superhero, no matter the rising crime, because <em>now</em> he was finally getting respect, with only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his nephews getting endangered in such a way he needed Paperinik's gadgets to save them</span> getting him back on the job.

By their claim, after they wiped their past crimes from history and redeemed themselves, the other Gods continued to call them the 'God of Lies', and treated them with little trust in the most mundane of matters. Eventually he got so sick of it he decided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">Then Let Me Be Evil</a> and jumped over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> with impunity. In order to escape this, the present day Loki, who was already beginning to feel this way towards them because of how he was being treated, ended up recognising this and, rather than either die free or embrace their destiny, instead chose to evolve into a new incarnation, becoming the God of <em>Stories</em>, who, pointedly, no longer <em>cares</em> what others think of them.

Having this done to him for thirty years starts to wear on him, to the point where he's willing to take on a dare and game hop to win that respect.
</li><li> A significant part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersUniversity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersUniversity">Monsters University</a>,</em> where Mike works hard to search for appreciation for his Scaring intellect despite lacking ability.

Sure, Mrs. Brisby is arguably too modest to bring this up herself and would probably decline a statue built in her honor, but the fact that nobody else in the sequel even so much as points out that Mrs. Brisby saved everyone and is AT LEAST as deserving of praise as Mr. Brisby makes the movie seem far more sexist than it should have. Oh, and the opening of the movie only refers to her as a widow.

However, the pilot isn't too upset, because, "[Batman] <em>always</em> stops [Joker]." much to Joker's annoyance. This turns out to be a plot point; Joker's furious that Batman doesn't see him as his greatest nemesis, but as "Some guy I fight."

In reality, Antonio Salieri was famous in his own time as a highly-regarded composer whose contributions to music are still recognized today. In addition to introducing opera to the Viennese court and setting the stage for the development of German opera, Salieri was responsible for teaching (among others) Beethoven, Schubert, and Liszt. Even Mozart himself acknowledged Salieri's talent.

</li><li> The Jedi entirely, who throughout the ages have saved the galaxy countless times, maintain peace, and take down evil empires by the dozens.

Harry knows he tends to end up just barely surviving and is usually beaten to a pulp for his trouble, but the his list accomplishments still speak for themselves, especially for those who weren't there personally. Many younger members of the council seem idolize Harry a great deal both for his accomplishments and his presence as a strong anti-establishment voice in the organization, and even hardliners like the Merlin and Morgan have a good deal of respect for Dresden's abilities despite their idealogical differences.

Despite everything they did and their loyal service throughout their time in the alpha quadrant, Starfleet still doesn't trust them (or so Chakotay suggests) simply because they didn't participate in the Dominion War. Instead, they're given ridiculously easy missions like escort duty, and viewed with suspicion by the admiralty.

<ul><li> Out of literally hundreds of named characters, here is a list of those who respect Tyrion Lannister: Jon Snow, Bronn, Jaime Lannister, Garlan Tyrell, Varys, Maester Aemon... and that's it. This is a very intelligent man who is directly responsible for protecting King's Landing from Stannis, schemed his way out of captivity (multiple times), survived two battles despite being a dwarf, and is basically one of the most intelligent, decent people in the whole damn series.

During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Robert's Rebellion</a>, he slipped past the siege of Storm's End and relieved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Stannis Baratheon</a> and his bannermen. Stannis rewarded Davos with a lordship, but still punished him for his previous life as a smuggler by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinGore">chopping off the last joint of all the fingers on his left hand</a>. Davos finds this rather reasonable, and has served Stannis loyally ever since, keeping the his fingerbones in a bag around his neck. Also, he was mocked for the blockade running by people who said he saved people with onions. Rather than take offense, he put an onion on his coat of arms.
</li><li> Stannis perceives Robert giving him Dragonstone as a slight, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that it was meant as an honor (particularly since Dragonstone was seen as the heir's lands), and Robert could have been well in his right to keep that and the Stormlands for his children. Although there are countless other examples where Stannis is genuinely screwed over and disrespected - namely by Renly betraying him and trying to steal his rightful crown, instead of doing his duty and supporting his elder brother, as Stannis did for Robert. And this after Stannis protected Renly as a boy through the siege at Storm's End... Renly promptly took sides with the same Tyrells who were starving them to death.
</li><li> Jaime Lannister. He saved King's Landing from being burnt to the ground by Aerys Targeryen, but everyone felt that breaking his oath to protect Aerys was more important (not that he helped it, since he never told anyone about the "being burnt to the ground" thing). Ever since, he's been dubbed the Kingslayer and is treated with mildly concealed contempt by everyone.

<ul><li> This is essentially Stannis Baratheon's fate and tragedy:
<ul><li> Stannis, commander of the terrible siege of Storm's End and conqueror of Dragonstone, resents Robert for giving their ancestral home and <em>sub-kingdom</em> to their kid brother Renly, who was too young to take part in the fighting. Stannis did his duty, but Robert's call embittered him. Renly, whose life Stannis saved as a young boy, ends up repaying his gratitude by rebelling against him because he has "a personality of a lobster".
</li><li> He even gets this posthumously, despite fighting the Boltons and dying to liberate Winterfell, Sansa dismisses him as a loser who got what was coming to him. The wildlings resent him for executing their leader, Mance Rayder, though Stannis wanted to integrate them into the Seven Kingdoms and make them part of his kingdom. The Northern lords who Stannis appealed to repeatedly snubbed him and left the North to the Boltons and end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a> by Jon and Sansa after they too are snubbed by most of these lords when Jon and Sansa seek to take back their home, Winterfell, from the Boltons. Jon, aside from housing Stannis and his troops for a time at Castle Black, doesn't show much gratitude to Stannis for saving the Night's Watch from Mance.
</li><li> Almost everything Stannis did, bring the Wildlings into the Seven Kingdoms, rally the Seven Kingdoms to better protect and defend the North, encourage Samwell Tarly's studies was more or less proven correct in its wisdom. Jon Snow, as King in the North, struggles to get Daenerys to prepare for the Long Night, a cause which Stannis more or less immediately believed in, becoming the first and only Southern Kingdom to answer Maester Aemon's summons. Samwell Tarly belatedly chides himself for not believing in Stannis when he mentioned the dragonglass on Dragonstone, and more or less the cause to rally and prepare the divided Seven Kingdoms to prepare for the Long Night could have gone smoothly had people backed and supported Stannis from the very beginning.

</li><li> Sansa after the Battle of the Bastards, where, as Jon acknowledges later, she was the one who saved the day, leaving her the legitimate heir to Winterfell, she is completely ignored by the Northern lords at the council, and Jon is praised as the avenger of the Red Wedding and then crowned King in the North.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> No matter how many times Buffy saved Sunnydale High from not just vampires, but bug people, evil robots, invisible people, fish monsters, nightmares come alive, ghosts, reanimated corpses, werewolves, and ancient evil abominations, most of the school populace treated her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser">Cool Loser</a> at best. However, this was subverted toward the end of the third season at the prom, where the entire graduating class gave their thanks to Buffy for saving them multiple times. And this was right after saving them from some hellhounds, too.
</li><li> Seems to be a major factor in Faith's decision to turn evil. Despite being a Slayer just like Buffy, Faith often felt like she was the backup and that she didn't matter as much as the other slayer. This, coupled with her low self-esteem and the fact she was blamed for a lot of mistakes (which in retrospect where just as much Buffy's mistakes as they were her own) caused her to snap and join the Mayor's side. In contrast, the Mayor often treated her with respect, gave her a nice apartment and shiny new toys, and often praised her abilities as being better than Buffy's. Despite the fact that the Scoobies probably didn't intentionally snub her, their relationship wasn't nearly as strong with her as it was with Buffy, which does make it understandable why she would feel this way.

<ul><li> Batiatus, despite being very cunning and having some of the best gladiators around, is still looked down upon by people of higher standing because he's not a blue blood and his work involves cooperation with unsavory characters. At one point he goes to great lengths to win over Magistrate Calavius, but when he finally asks Calavius to support his run for political office the Magistrate politely but patronizingly advises him to stick with the job appropriate to his standing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thirsting for revenge, he kills two birds with one stone by murdering Calavius and then framing his archrival Salonius for the crime.</span> Eventually, when Glaber also refuses to sponsor his political ambitions, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Batiatus blackmails him using the fact that Illythia committed murder in Batiatus's house.</span>
</li><li> Ashur faithfully serves Batiatus' ludus outside the arena, particularly through cloak-and-dagger intrigue, but is treated with contempt by the gladiators because he's a weak fighter and the gladiators only respect skill in honorable combat. Ashur's response to the gladiators is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">Then Let Me Be Evil</a>, throwing fellow gladiators under the bus in order to rise through Batiatus's favor.

Crixus is struck down with a life-threatening wound, but before losing consciousness he uses his helmet to reflect the sun into Theokles's eyes, saving Spartacus's hide at the critical moment and enabling him to kill Theokles. From this point onward their roles are reversed, as the public cheers Spartacus's subsequent rise to the top while forgetting about Crixus during the long months he spends healing his wounds. By the time he's able to return to the ludus, Crixus has lost a lot of strength and Spartacus is able to humiliate him and rub it in his face, showing ingratitude for Crixus's unacknowledged role in his ascent. This is especially painful for Crixus, who has always devoted his life to the ludus and upheld the gladiators' code of honor which Spartacus so frequently rebels against. It's not until Crixus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saves Spartacus from an attempted murder and makes a comeback in the arena</span> that people start respecting him again.

Like with the Barksdale investigation, Herc and Carver again are relied upon to do the leg work for the detail, and while they are instrumental in planting trackers on many of the smuggling ring's vehicles, they're the ones stuck with menial jobs like installing an air conditioner in the home of a judge approving the detail's wiretaps. The final straw for Herc and Carver is when they're left out in the rain waiting for Nick Sobotka to return home, despite his having already turned himself in. Daniels attempts to convince them to stay, pointing out that surveillance is part of the job, but Herc and Carver aren't having it. Seeing that Major Colvin is looking for a DEU Sergeant posting in the Western District, Carver jumps at it, feeling that Colvin will at the very least recognize his rank.

<ul><li> 3 Doors Down 's famous career-making single "Kryptonite" features a narrator who uses the character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> as an allegory for how he feels like someone in his life or perhaps the people in his life in general make him feel this way by taking everything he does for granted. The narrator points out that he works hard to do things that the person/people he is addressing want him to do, essentially becoming their Superman despite their lack of acknowledgement. He notes that he really doesn't mind the work, but it's the lack of appreciation that leaves him extremely frustrated. Still, he will always stand by the song's subject with all of his might. He also wonders if when he's doing well and being strong whether the person(s) will still be there for him, as Brad Arnold says:
<div class="indent">"It's not just asking, If I fall down, will you be there for me? Because it's easy to be there for someone when they're down. But it's not always easy to be there for somebody when they're doing good. And that's the question it's asking. It's like, If I go crazy, will you still call me Superman? It's asking, If I'm down, will you still be there for me? But at the same time, If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand? That's kind of asking, If I'm doing good, will you be there for me? Will you not be jealous of me? That's the basic question that song's asking, and maybe throughout the years of singing that song, I might have come up with more meanings for it than it actually might have originally had."

<ul><li> Hercules was originally sentenced to ten labors, but the king ruled out two of them and sentenced him to two more. Most of the Labors were designed in the first place to kill him, humiliate him, or just make his life miserable, and the guy would use any excuse he could find to prolong the thing.

</li><li> A fairly common trope. A king would try to kill a hero, either out of personal vendetta, fear of a prophecy, or as a favor to another king.

He usually didn't.
</li><li> So many troubles in Greek myth got their start with somebody not paying proper respect to somebody else (a deity, somebody they knew, even a chance-met stranger) that it could almost be read as a collection of cautionary tales <em>against</em> this trope. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em> in particular started because Odysseus didn't perform the necessary sacrifices to Poseidon for a safe voyage (granted, tormenting the guy for twenty years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">was a bit much</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> God invokes this trope with Himself in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfMalachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfMalachi">Book of Malachi</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><em>A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My fear? says the Lord of Hosts to you, O priests, who despise My name.</em> (Malachi 1:6, Modern English Version)
</div></li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> gets hit with this one: "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household." (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels">Matthew 13:57</a>) He also tells His followers not to do good deeds for praise, Earthly rewards, or recognition, but rather for the sake of doing good, and not to expect even so much as a "thank you."
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>, this plays a role in what ultimately what turns Loki against the Aesir. Loki, commonly seen now as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of Norse myths because he's the cause of Ragnarok, but initially Loki was their <em>ally</em>, who often aided them in many quests and was directly responsible for them owning any of their iconic objects. However, because the Aesir were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">Jerkass Gods</a>, they blamed Loki for any problem they faced and forced him to fix it, which eventually pushed Loki's pranks into getting more extreme until it killed Baldr (arguable if even that was the case; initially <em>how</em> Baldr died was unstated, and many aspects of the story attributed to Loki are later interpretations; originally, all Loki did was taunt Frigg about her son's death), leading to one particularly cruel punishment... which initially, was <em>only</em> for having bested them in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnarkToSnarkCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnarkToSnarkCombat">Snark-to-Snark Combat</a>. As a result, when he escapes, he got so sick of their shit he united their enemies together and laid siege to Asgard, kicking off Ragnarok.

<ul><li> The Imperial Guard make up the vast bulk of the Imperium's war machine and are responsible for most of its defenses and conquests; it's said that if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">the Space Marines</a> are the tip of the spear of the Imperium, then the Imperial Guard are the rest of the spear head, the spear shaft, and <em>the guy holding the spear</em>. But both in- and out-of-universe they are forever forgotten and pushed aside by the Space Marines.
</li><li> The Fall of Medusa V global campaign of 2006 provides a meta example. The results of various worldwide tournaments were submitted to determine the fate of the planet Medusa V. The Space Marines and Imperial Guard lost a good majority of their battles; the former due to Space Marines being the usual go-to army for novice players, and the latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">because they were consistently bottom-tier</a>. However, the Space Marines were (and still are) far and away the most popular army of the game, and seeing a Space Marine defeat as a serious setback to the brand's image, Games Workshop declared that even though the Space Marines and Imperial Guard lost the majority of their battles, they were still the canon winners of the campaign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">on moral grounds</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23eis');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23eis" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23eis');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They claim that the Space Marines won the space battles, and while the planet was lost to heresy, the combined Imperials managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">evacuate most of the civilian population before leaving</a></span>. Understandably, the players of the other factions were less than pleased.
</li><li> In the backstory, Perturabo suffered heavily from this, due to him and his legion being typecast as siege experts. They would get assigned either brutal meat-grinder sieges or garrison duty, with the latter featuring such madness as ten Iron Warriors guarding a planet with a population of millions - with the completion of a planetary campaign rarely heralding anything other than assignment to another meat-grinder. This was so prevalent that prior to the Drop Site Massacre, traitor marines constructing fortifications for Horus' forces were heard asking why the Iron Warriors weren't doing the work. This is particularly grim given that the Emperor's Children, another Space Marine Legion, were given special honours (such as being permitted to wear the Emperor's aquila on their breastplates, something no other Legion was allowed to do) because <em>Fulgrim gave an impressive speech once</em>.

He has spent a large part of his adult life trying to prop up his alcoholic brother Tom, and has never been so much as thanked. Late in the play, he tries putting himself forward as a mayoral candidate instead of George as a way to get the respect he feels he deserves, but no-one is interested, and when he objects to the way he is treated by everyone, he is dismissed as a whiner.

Why? Because, in the course of saving the universe from "pukoid" monsters, he was forced to destroy a StarCon ship, commandeer the StarCon flagship, and get together with a StarCon ambassador (who's destined to be his wife anyway). The only reason he's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock">Thrown Out the Airlock</a> is because he's a <em>very</em> good janitor.

It takes a measure of suspension of disbelief to swallow that so many gangsters are willing to pick a fight with him considering his reputation.

<ul><li> Nowhere is it more obvious than in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>. A DJ will constantly tell tales of your exploits, along with giving you a nickname or title based on your level and karma. Now, if you have good karma, it makes perfect sense for people to bother you with whatever problem they have: They know you've helped others, why wouldn't you help them? The joke comes when you have bad karma, no reason is given why people will come to you for help, or why the guards don't simply SHOOT YOU on sight, knowing all too well that whatever business you have in town, it's not going to be good. And of course, 90% of the people will treat you like a bag of shit, no matter if you are the best thing that has happened to them or a dangerous, homicidal nutso who could snap from the slightest insult and bash the insulter's head in without a bit of remorse (at least with the Brotherhood of Steel, this is perfectly in character). <em>Finally</em>, with the <em>Broken Steel</em> DLC, after the final story quest, you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">become an honored member of the BoS after the activation of Project Purity and, a few hours later, they celebrate you as a hero after blowing up the Adams Air Force base, where the remaining forces of the Enclave were stationed.</span> There's also the fact that the ending narration will basically call you a coward if you have Fawkes or Charon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> turn on the water purifier at the end of the game</span>, even though that's pretty much the smartest thing to do since they're <em>immune</em> to radiation.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> downplays this (the major factions are willing to go as far as pardoning all your crimes against them just for the <em>opportunity</em> to offer you a job), this is played to the hilt for minor factions and independent NPCs until you do their quests, with the exception of the Powder Gangers (a gang of ex-cons turned raiders), who will alternatively send a messenger offering a ceasefire between you and their gang if you kill enough of them.
</li><li> Once again played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>. You might be named <em>General</em> of the Minutemen, but that won't stop your alleged second-in-command from telling you to go kill a nest of ghouls <em>every five minutes</em>. The Brotherhood of Steel and Institute aren't any better. At least in the case of the Railroad it's justified in that you end up as one of their few remaining senior operatives, so they <em>have</em> to keep leaning on you for support. And then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Marcy Long</a>, a civilian who does nothing but bitch at you about how terrible everything is no matter how hard you've worked turning Sanctuary into the best settlement in the entire Commonwealth.
</li></ul></li><li> Very much present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite">Black &amp; White</a></em>, where, despite being a god, you must perform fairly menial tasks like finding someone's sheep or throwing rocks — which stands to reason, as an agrarian society probably <em>would</em> mutter a quick prayer for aid over even the tiniest of things.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazingAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazingAngels">Blazing Angels</a> 1</em> and two, over time, your service record indicates hundreds of aircraft destroyed, thousands of vehicles blown up, and dozens of ships sent to Davy Jones Locker, and stopping entire enemy offensives single-handedly, and in the endgame, your final objective, destroying an elite German jet squadron, has them taunting you. You've destroyed a twentieth of the Axis air force, a Panzer army, and a quarter of the Japanese Navy, and they STILL INSULT YOU? Granted, in the sequel, the game makes up the excuse that you are in a top secret elite squadron who has experimental equipment, and you get all of the nation's top awards, but that doesn't cover up the fact that you destroyed enough enemy units to make up the campaign record of an air force.
</li><li> There's a rather annoying, if minor, example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>. On the prologue, you had to battle Seifer as a tutorial. Even though he's supposedly the town's bully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">and is also supposed to be pretty good in combat</a> you'll probably kick his ass once you're given the chance to (you don't get to battle him on the semi Tournament Arc so that you can see him at his <em>best</em>). He also has the habit of mocking you every time you talk to him. After the end of the prologue, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you discover that the whole Twilight Town was just a virtual simulation made for keeping Roxas away from Organization XIII</span> and you take control of Sora. You may think that Seifer may get a chance to really show his worth after knowing that little fact. However, it only gets worse from there. As with Roxas' story, he also tries to mock you every time he can, but this time it doesn't help the fact that the Struggle host thinks he's the hot shit on the matter, preventing you from fighting him unless you defeat Heiner and Setzer 20 TIMES IN A ROW. After finally doing all of this, you'll think that he'll actually be a competent boss fight to compensate for all the shit he put you through, but no. He's actually weaker than the time you fought him as Roxas. Even then the Struggle host still treats you like a retard by saying that you're finally ready to fight him and Seifer won't even change his NPC dialog.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em>, by the time you reach the third section of Liberty Island, you've assassinated the heads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a>, you've completely obliterated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriadsAndTheTongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriadsAndTheTongs">the Triads</a>, and you've severely damaged the drug smuggling operation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCartel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCartel">the Colombian drug cartel</a>.

In the Tower of the Sea God next to the first town, a boy is trapped on a high ledge and his friend cannot get him down. Even though you save the kid with the Lash Psynergy, both boys coldly thank you and are more concerned about eating something instead of being grateful you didn't leave the kid to starve to death.

Yes, Shepard can do a lot of menial, unethical and even sometimes illegal tasks for little reward, but most of the time they just <em>ask</em>, with the player able to tell them to go away at any point, or Shepard approaches <em>them</em> offering their assistance. The only people who actually order Shepard around are either Shepard's superior (e.g. Hackett in the first game), Shepard's close friends (e.g. Anderson) or a famous powerful badass on Shepard's level (e.g. Aria, who still obviously respects Shepard).

In other words, they do not give you the respect you deserve, but they do, at least, tend to react to you as a friend rather than as scum.
</li><li> A big offender is being the head of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Imperial Legion</a>. Imperial soldiers, who now technically report to you, will still treat you like you're a new recruit. You do at least get to get away with being out of uniform if you outrank them.
</li><li> Likewise for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">Great House</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">Telvanni</a>, though at least it's Justified as completely in-character for them, seeing as how they're a group of magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a> traits.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>:
<ul><li> You can be the freakin' Archmage and everyone in town will still treat you like J. Random Peasant. And even if you helped the emperor's heir save the world or something, you still have to start as an Apprentice in the Mage's Guild or an Amateur in the Fighter's Guild with others treating you like crap. Later averted, though; when you complete the main story, people will shower you with praise when they see you. And if you are the Arch-Mage, the mages at the Arcane University show proper respect.
</li><li> Played with in <em>Knights of the Nine</em>, the expanded content mission, where you require the approval of a prophet before going on a crusade for the gods. Boast of doing good deeds and he'll just mock you and refuse to help you; you have to either be humble, or confess to (i.e. boast about) evil you've done to gain his help.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Doubly subverted</a> in the <em>Shivering Isles</em> expansion pack. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taking the mantle of the Madgod</span>, most of the realm's populace, including the haughty guards, will express their respect/reverence to you, and you cannot be arrested for crime (though you still have to pay the fine or be booted out of the city until you do). Unfortunately, you are still forbidden from entering the Saint/Seducer sanctuaries, Zealots will remain hostile toward you, and do not expect anyone in Cyrodiil to believe you.
</li><li> After closing the Oblivion Gate outside a city and completing a minor side quest for the countess (which she delegates to you because "you seem like the trustworthy type"), you approach her to buy a house in a city, only to be told, "I don't trust you enough to talk about that." And a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich">nobleman</a> in Cheydinhal throws weekly parties for the city's up-and-comers, which never includes you, because "If you were somebody, I'd know. But I don't, so you aren't." That some of his guests are low-level members of guilds you might command, plus the Count whose son you rescue from Oblivion while saving his city, makes this a bit jarring.
</li><li> A flaw in the game's AI can cause this to happen unintentionally. As mentioned above, new dialogues involving what a wonderful savior you are appear after beat the main quest. You can even hear bandits literally singing your praises to each other. However, it won't stop them from trying to kill you the moment they see you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> The biggest offender is quite possibly Vilkas of the Companions. If you first attempt to join the Companions after successfully defeating Alduin (legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse">Beast of the Apocalypse</a>), becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">The Archmage</a>, Listener of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">Dark Brotherhood</a>, Master Thief of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild">Thieves' Guild</a>, Thane of every city, pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">single-handedly winning</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a>, and completing countless other side quests, you'll walk into Jorrvaskr with the intention of becoming a Companion, only to be refused by him, with him telling the Harbinger, "I've never even heard of this outsider".
</li><li> The Companions can lead to a lot of humorous instances of this trope. Like the second-newest member (after you) boasts about killing a bear yesterday, asking what <em>you</em> killed lately. Unfortunately, there is no way to respond with "two dragons, a draugr deathlord, and an entire bandit encampment." And some of the more senior members will still openly tell you that they think you're a wimp, even if you're now the <em>Harbinger</em>.
</li><li> This can be quite jarring if you're a Legate in the Imperial Legion, just happen to encounter a few Imperial soldiers escorting a prisoner (Stormcloak) along the road, and will tell you to get the hell away from them and not interfere with "Imperial business." Bonus points for, following that line, they warn you to get the hell away from them before they draw their swords and attack you.
</li><li> Dirge, a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild">Thieves' Guild</a>, definitely takes the cake. He's the guild's muscle and spends the entirety of the game hanging around in their hideout. Practically every time you pass him by (and he's conveniently placed right in your path, too) he'll mutter that even if you're one of them, you better not try anything or you'll have to deal with him. He'll say this even when you're the guild grandmaster who's the greatest thief in the land and has done more for the guild than all of its other members for the last fifteen years. Respect, nothing; how about not hassling your <em>boss</em>?
</li><li> The randomized guard dialogue can get schizophrenic about this — various achievements <em>do</em> add suitably respectful comments. The problem is that it doesn't <em>remove</em> the comments that were for achievements that were overridden later, so a guard can speak insultingly about you being the newbie Companion and <em>immediately</em> afterward praise you as the Companions' Harbinger.
</li><li> In the <em>Dragonborn</em> DLC, Master Neloth (of the aforementioned House Telvanni) returns as a major player in the DLC storyline. Being the world-saving Dragonborn doesn't get you an iota of respect from him. Archmage of the College of Winterhold? Still condescending, although he's marginally interested that you were the one who found <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Eye of Magnus</span>. One way the Dragonborn <em>can</em> impress him is to have read the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigBookOfEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigBookOfEverything">Oghma Infinium</a> before meeting him, due to having done something that Neloth himself tried to do for years without success.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The case for majority of protagonists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>; despite their great actions, nobody seems to care. Hilariously noticeable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonANewBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonANewBeginning">Harvest Moon: A New Beginning</a></em>, where you arrive in Echo Village and kickstart the village that has been stagnant for likely decades, get more people to move in by <em>building their houses for free</em> despite the time and money you spend on materials, cause their economy to boom by buying from shops and shipping produce, fulfill increasingly difficult goals to aide the town's restoration <em>and</em> while doing all of this, you also run a pretty successful farm on the side! But woe betide you if you <em>dare</em> to lose a festival and those townspeople who should be grateful that you gave them a roof over their head will berate you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV">Quest for Glory IV</a></em> the character is magically teleported halfway across the planet to a small, isolated village that's highly distrustful of strangers and has no way of knowing all the amazing stuff you've done (like, oh, saving the entire world from total destruction twice over). Only three characters in the entire game respect your abilities, two of whom are returning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Baba Yaga and Ad Avis</span>) and the other being this game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, who is the master of the latter. The people do greatly warm up to you once you do some notable good deeds. It gets downright heartwarming with comments like "I never believed true heroes existed until now."
</li><li> Rather strange case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>. Auron is supposed to be 'The best guardian there ever was' and 'The Legendary Guardian', but guess how many characters except the party acknowledge his pure Badassery and reputation? <em>Two!</em> Canon says he is one of the men guardians look upon in respect, but does he get any of said respect or has he influence to any of the events? Little or completely none. Damn, being famous in Spira must suck! Granted, most people presumed him to be dead, and Auron is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">not the type to take advantage of fame</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> has players build up their reputation in cities to staggering amounts, and be lauded as a hero... and go to an NPC in said town to discover that they have no damn clue who you are. Could you stir up any trouble... like everyone who didn't do this quest in the first place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>, your exploits in the previous game are well-known throughout the entire world, and you even get a cool title to go with it. But that doesn't mean you can expect any actual respect for bringing about a global renaissance. In one particularly egregious case, you can get run out of your own birthplace for being on friendly terms with a rival faction.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>, no matter how much crap Yuri Lowell goes through, people will always treat him as a dangerous outlaw and attribute his guild's good deeds to the Imperial Knights. Amusingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a>, as Yuri is perfectly happy with not being celebrated, but it really frustrates his knight friend Flynn who gets all the credit for Yuri's heroics.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia">Tales of Eternia</a></em>, no one in Inferia gives the heroes trying to stop the Grand Fall any credit (trying to execute them several times instead!) until they absolutely must acknowledge them (begrudgingly, because there's absolutely nothing else that can be done but to trust them) because the very idea of the Grand Fall is heretical. People in Celestia are much more helpful and grateful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a>,</em> the protagonist is the SAME Link from the first game. You can understand that people might ask him to save a kidnapped child or help the citizenry; after all, that's what he is supposed to do. But to refuse to let him cross a bridge, or to ask him to fetch some <strong>water</strong>? Not only did this guy save the country from the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>, but he is the envoy of the <em>ruler</em> of said country.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">Majora's Mask</a></em>, if you bring the Couple's Mask to the Happy Mask Salesman, he acknowledges that while he didn't see it, you probably did a lot of frustration-inducing stuff to get it, and even says he wishes he was looking for that mask so your efforts would be for a little more than (as far as he knew) nothing. For the rest of the game, however, you spend countless hours helping people out, slaying monsters, and reliving the same three days over and over via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is put down, but no one even acknowledges that you saved the world. Even the Happy Mask Salesman doesn't really acknowledge that you stopped the moon from crashing and is only happy that you managed to recover the titular mask.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em> can get pretty bad with this sometimes. Granted, virtually none of Skyloft's denizens know Link is risking life and limb to save the entire world each time he heads off on his Loftwing, but quite possibly the <em>only</em> people in the entire game that show Link anything approaching proper respect for a good portion of the play time are Fi, who acknowledges you as her master from the get-go, and Zelda's father. Pretty much everyone else gives Link no end of crap; Faron the dragon doesn't care that you killed a scorpion the size of a school bus and crossed swords with a demon lord, she still questions what the goddess was thinking choosing you, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrapper</a> contrives to be a condescending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to you at any available opportunity, even though you're the reason he's operational at all. Faron is particularly bad; it's not enough that you have the Scale that's supposed to be obtainable only by the chosen hero of the Goddess, you have to prove yourself by <strong>fetching magic water</strong> for her before she'll let you into the temple containing one of the Sacred Flames. And later on, you have to learn part of a song from her; despite having gotten her scale, proving yourself worthy of entering the temple, AND getting the Flame from said temple, you have to prove yourself AGAIN before she's convinced that you're the real deal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em> has many of the usual "demand inane things from the legendary hero who awoke from a 100-year slumber to take down the living embodiment of evil" situations, but probably the most ridiculous example is Gerudo Town. Even after saving them from a rampaging ancient super-robot and returning it to their control, as well as completing all the sidequests in the village to convince their queen to let you borrow her Thunder Helm, the guards will still kick you out if you walk into town without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag">special outfit that makes them think you're a woman</a>. Men aren't allowed in Gerudo Town, you see; but given that the queen knows you're a man and that you've personally solved all their problems, you'd think they could make an exception.
</li></ul></li><li> Played a little <em>too</em> straight in the Wii game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChroniclesMyLifeAsAKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChroniclesMyLifeAsAKing">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King</a></em>. Once you've set your minions (ahem, "adventurers") their tasks, the only thing you can do all day is <em>run around the city, talking to the citizens</em> or building buildings to allow even MORE citizens in. Talking to them allows you to stay up later in the day (extends the game clock), so that your minions can actually complete their tasks. To add insult to injury, once your city gets to a certain point, some of your citizens will begin offering fetch quests. Doing these quests involves issuing a "bequest" - tasking your minions to find something in the town - which <em>costs you money</em>. Only reward is a morale gain - which lets you stay up late at night.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> most people only view you as a wolf, a lovely white wolf that brings good luck, but a wolf all the same. Up until halfway through the game you won't get much if any respect for the deeds you've done by most of characters in the game. And there still is a rather long side quest where you have to prove to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a> that you're god. Ultimately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the game subverts this during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>: with Issun's help, every character in the game realizes that you're really a deity and prays for your success and to thank you for all you've done. And since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">respect equals power</a>, their prayers give you the power to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.</span>
</li><li> The main character of <em>Rhodan: Myth of the Illochim</em> is a 3,000-year-old immortal hero and the head of government for Terra (Earth) and its colonies. He spends the entire first level of the game trying to escape his own home after being confined there by his best friend (his own security minister) for unexplained reasons. At a later point in the game he's arrested on suspicion of murder and thrown straight into a filthy cell, with no opportunity to try and explain what happened - even though he was found unconscious after being attacked at the crime scene.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is especially prevalent in the second expansion, where by level 80 your character has probably slain multiple dragons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>, demon lords, and more monsters than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies">should logically exist</a>, but will still be treated like dirt by NPCs, rarely acknowledging your exploits, and if they do, its just to say "I don't care about them, go kill some animals and bring me their meat. I'm hungry". Admittedly if you do enough notable things NPCs will start to sing your praises, and once you've helped somebody their dialogue will generally be friendly to you, but that won't stop everybody else demanding you fetch them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">20 Bear Asses</a>.
</li><li> Not as bad in the <em>Cataclysm</em> zones from the third expansion. Characters will generally recognise you as a great hero and faction leaders frequently show up and make it clear that they know who you are and what you're capable of. They still want you to collect bear asses, but they have more flattering ways of justifying it. The rewritten early quests also tend to try to make you feel less anonymous.
</li><li> John J. Keeshan in Burning Steppes will treat you like an ordinary soldier unless you finished the Redridge zone. Then he'll greet you as an old friend.
</li><li> This is invoked again heavily in 'Mists of Pandaria', where the native Pandaren are often invited to join the Horde or Alliance - sometimes boasting of their exploits in the process, only for the Pandaren to immediately rebuke them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">often reasoning that the factions messed with their once peaceful lives by bringing their ensuring warfare into the Pandaren's homelands</a>. Meaning, you often end up either cleaning the mess your faction has made and/or you go around doing menial chores once again. And that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">big, black dragon from the last expansion</a> that you narrowly defeated when it tried to destroy the world? Never heard of it.
<ul><li> A fairly amusing case happens with one Shrine of Seven Stars draenei NPC who's in an argument with a pandaren. If you try to convince him of what the pandaren is arguing, he will say "What do you know? You act like you're the savior of Azeroth!" even if you have the "Savior Of Azeroth" title (from defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">Madness</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Deathwing</a> on Heroic).
</li></ul></li><li> During <em>Escalation</em>, players are given a quest to help an old seer retrace the steps of Emperor Shao Hao, who appreciates that despite being a powerful warrior, you are willing to help an old man climb a mountain. When it's done, the seer commends you for your humility, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">then reveals that he is the ghost of Emperor Shao Pao, and tells you how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a> was his one great vice.</span>
</li><li> <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> puts your character in charge of a military garrison for your faction; this is specifically <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">because</a></em> of your past deeds. You still end up doing some rather menial tasks for quests, but these are generally to establish relations with the locals who don't know you as well, or else because you've gained a reputation for "getting things done". An amusing sidenote: Your job as a commander comes with the duty of dishing out missions for your followers, among whom you'll find a mix of new characters, famed badasses and their AU counterparts. While some missions are tuned for geared followers and definitely count as respectful, there's nothing stopping you from sending the restless ghost of Admiral Taylor to collect Twenty Bear Asses or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour">clean the latrine</a>. Putting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">battle-eager</a> characters like Lantresor on permanent mining duty also counts.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>, random City Watch <em>will</em> still be all "I'm busy. Find another people to chat up." Wonderful thing to say to a <em>Knight and member of Nine</em>, you bastard. It's worse if you sided with the City Watch instead of the Shadow Thieves in Act I since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Captain Brelaina promotes you to the rank of Lieutenant to replace the late Lieutenant Kyton (who was the ranking City Watch Officer in the Docks District).</span>

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> series generally averts this, though there are some instances where it's played straight:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatXSkiesOfDeception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatXSkiesOfDeception">Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception</a></em> plays it mostly straight. Though your own side worships the ground you fly over, the enemy still seems to see you as a punk kid, just a very lucky punk kid. "Aaah, there he is. There's Nemesis. Stay away from him, he's allll mine." *shot down in 10 seconds* Although you become renowned throughout the entire enemy military, as either The Southern Cross or Nemesis, Gryphus 1 just gets no actual respect from them, not even after shooting down the Invincible Superweapon.
</li><li> This is an inversion from the case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</a></em>, where the player character quickly becomes renowned by the enemy for their skill, even being nicknamed the "Demons of Razgris" after destroying both of the enemy's giant burst missile-launching submarines. The actual soldiers you interact with and defend from enemy attack likewise show the reverence you'd expect for the player character's skill; at one point, a group of tired and dismotivated soldiers that have failed twice to take over an enemy fortress are quickly motivated into a third, ultimately successful attempt simply because one of them mentions that you'll be flying support for them. The higher-ups, however, hold next to no respect for you, especially after another squadron frames yours for an attack on civilian structures in enemy territory; immediately after the above fortress mission <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the player and his squad are labeled as traitors solely on the word of that other squadron, who turn out to be Belkan infiltrators attempting to prolong the war</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a> series also provides the grand champion of subverting this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar">Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War</a>, wherein the protagonist, Cipher, quickly goes from nobody to nightmare, receiving the title of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Demon Lord of the Round Table</a>" and being accredited as the reason several fights are won. By late game, merely identifying Galm Team in the IFF is enough to turn around an entire battle and lifting morale from the ground all the way to the top. In contrast with the above example, your superiors in this game consider you an indispensable asset in the war and a briefing tells you as much flat out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirForceDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AirForceDelta">Air Force Delta</a> Strike</em> plays this straight. Lilia treats the pilots with the same condescending tone all the way to the last mission.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em>. Despite being the trusted Golden Girl of the paramilitary outfit, the lackeys and scientists still treat Joanna like garbage in the <em>training</em> areas. Of course, once you get to the level where they are hostages, they are happy to see you, and at least once you've beaten that level they'll stop insulting you whenever they see you. Apart from that guy in the basement, anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>. "Oh, what's that? You just saved the entire city from a devastating plague? Wow, you're a hero! Now go deliver my mail. And defeat a few cultists. Just think, in five more levels we'll let you wear a <em>cape</em>!" Though at least the citizenry start to sing your praises as they pass by.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable I</a></em> is built around averting this trope, with people praising you if you're good and cowering if you're evil. Then you meet Briar Rose, an experienced heroine who mocks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> early in the game. It's a scripted event, so even though it's possible to go through a large chunk of the game's world thanks to its open-endedness and gather much experience and fame along the way, she'll still call you out for being a greenhorn. There's also the fact that people <em>will</em>, no matter what, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">call you a chicken chaser</a> (after the Hero's initial title) and laugh at you until you buy another title. Thunder, another hero in Bowerstone, shows even more contempt towards you, although some of that is due to kicking his little sister's ass during hero training beforehand. His sister, Whisper, is even worse; sure, when you first arrive at the Hero's Guild a bit of arrogance on her part is understandable (though ironically, that's when she's at her nicest), but she will then spend the rest of the game mocking you and telling you just how much better than you she is, regardless of how many times you beat her in a fight, completely outmatch her in a quest where you directly compete against her, or otherwise demonstrate that she is literally nowhere near in your league. She will eventually admit that its only because she's jealous of you for being so much better than her.
</li><li> Justified and then averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines"> Vampire: The Masquerade  Bloodlines</a></em>. At the start of the game, you play a fledgling vampire who's just been introduced to undead society and is sitting firmly on the bottom rung. A fair number of your quests involve trying to curry favor with various political leaders and sects, and some of the older vampires actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">have freaky powers</a> that force you to obey them. The aversion comes later in the game—as you get stronger, carving through hoards of enemy vampires and even vampire hunters, the elders of the city start treating you as someone they <em>want</em> on their side, or else as someone they want to dust before you become a threat. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> (sort of) at one point where the player has the option to tell some uncooperative NPCs "I've got to get a publicist. You two obviously aren't aware of my reputation."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, most of what you do goes unnoticed because... well, you did it centuries ago. That's the drawback of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>. Thing is, in the individual time periods where you did the incredible thing (particularly 65 Million BC and 600 AD), certain townspeople <em>do</em> recognize you and praise your accomplishments.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma">Terranigma</a></em> has got to be one of the most extreme examples of this trope. Thanks for reviving the world, defeating all the villains and monsters who were threatening it, and sealing away the very spirit of darkness, Ark! Now go ahead and die, we're done with you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyWorldMyWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyWorldMyWay">My World, My Way</a></em> features the princess of the land moonlighting as a hero. She averts this because everyone immediately recognizes her as a hero (because the king's agent is paying them to, against her knowledge), but they still play it straight and give her meaningless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithAHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithAHerring">With A Herring</a> jobs, because "That's what heroes do!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> particularly well in Oasis Town, where the heroine directly asks what quest this town is going to give her, and the response is to 1. Collect 5 cough grass to make cold medicine, 2. gather 5 mountain grapes in a forest you have to plant, 3. kill 10 venombugs eating the mayor's garden, 4. Go pick 10 birthday flowers, 5. Light bonfires to attract firepigs, which are a nuisance, so kill 10 of them after you bring them here, and 6. collect 10 Magic Fellworts. This is just the stuff the mayor spat out at you before the princess interrupted him screaming that she's not his maid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">zOMG!</a></em> can invoke this. Once your level reaches a certain point, the NPCs who give you the repeatable quests say "I should stop wasting your time here, you probably have better things to do. I'll handle the rest myself." But then you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">suppress your level</a> and they'll get right back to bossing you around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>:
<ul><li> You can increase your respect (which, in game play terms amounts to how many fellow gang members you can take to assist you in a mission) by working out, dressing nice, doing missions and driving out the gangs from the city. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">certain</a> mission, you are suddenly dumped without warning into the countryside and the gangs retake the entire damn city, including your home street.</span>
</li><li> Played straight with CJ's brother Sweet. No matter what he does, CJ is nothing more than the family black sheep to him even though he's actually more "put together" than Sweet. What's worse is that Sweet tends to lord the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">Brian (CJ's other brother) died on CJ's watch</a> and knows he feels extremely guilty about it. Their sister Kendal even stays away from that topic but at one point outright tells CJ she knows it's not his fault. Even when CJ is pretty much leading a successful life with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> (Woozie, Truth, Kendal, Cesar), Sweet still calls him a "buster".
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade">Jak II: Renegade</a></em> when Daxter asks Torn why they get all the crummy missions:
<div class="indent"><strong>Torn</strong>: Because <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis">I. Don't. Like. You!</a></strong>
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord">Overlord</a></em> games, especially the 2nd one, most people don't show you the respect an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> deserves. In the first game you can try to earn their respect or slaughter them. In the second game you don't even pretend to be nice; you can either brainwash them or again slaughter them.
</li><li> In the Eye of the North expansion to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, 'faction' mechanics toyed with in previous installments reach the point where some items are only possible to acquire through earning a reputation-based title with that faction, with characters lacking that title being rudely informed that the items in question aren't available to just anyone. Never mind that for three of these factions, it is perfectly possible to have single-handedly rescued the organisation from their greatest enemies or to have destroyed the entity that serves as their greatest nemesis without having achieved sufficient reputation to "earn" these services.
</li><li> In all of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a></em> sequels, no one is inclined to believe Guybrush's claims that he is the Mighty Pirate who defeated LeChuck (four times!). Most of the time, he can't even convince people he's over twenty-one. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge">Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge</a></em> this is particulary ironic, as he tells everyone about his exploits enough that people who know him are sick of hearing about them. He's also penned a trilogy of books about his killing of LeChuck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrawnToLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrawnToLife">Drawn to Life</a></em>. Holy cow the villagers are selfish for so much stuff. In the beginning of the game, the town is in ruins and covered in shadows, and everything that ever existed is disappearing due to damage to the book of creation. After the hero brings back the sun, food, weather, time, and other necessities, the hero is told to get things like beach toys to make the beach more lively.
</li><li> Both played straight and averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>. During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">first game</a>, much of what you do is (presumably) actively kept secret by the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">Iron Throne</a></span>, as it would do their plans no good for your actions to come to light, so it's understandable that people haven't often heard of you. Averted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, who does give you 'respect' by sending ever stronger assassins, and by circles who have access to first-hand information. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">second game</a>, you're in a different country, so your actions in the first game are obviously not as widely known, although the quests you actually <em>do</em> in Athkatla don't have much effect on people's responses to you. Even after becoming known as the killer of a whole nest of vampires, you will still be asked to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">find a missing gong</a>. Hilariously lampshaded in the original; at one point, you will get the option to say this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Main Character:</strong> OK, I've just about had my fill of riddle asking, quest assigning, insult throwing, pun hurling, hostage taking, iron mongering, smart arsed fools, freaks, and felons that continually test my will, mettle, strength, intelligence, and most of all, patience! If you've got a straight answer anywhere in that bent little head of yours, I want to hear it pretty damn quick or I'm going to take a large blunt object roughly the size of Elminster and his hat, and stuff it lengthwise into a crevice of your being so seldom seen that even the denizens of the Nine Hells themselves wouldn't touch it with a twenty-foot rusty halberd! Have I made myself perfectly clear?!
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a>: Lord Of Destruction</em>, the expansion pack for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a> II</em>, this is how you are treated by the Barbarians (and especially by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">the corrupt</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Elder Nihlithak</a></span>) in the fifth and final Act of the game. You have just defeated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Lord of Terror himself, Diablo</span>, not to mention previously defeating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his brother Mephisto</span>, and what do you get? Qual-Kehk says, "You have the look of a warrior. An extra soldier would be useful, <em>but don't expect anyone to mourn if you get yourself killed</em>." Nihlithak is a lot nastier. "After so many have died, who are you to think you can accomplish what our warriors could not?" And, "Ending the siege [will] not earn immediate respect, outsider. Respect only comes with sacrifice — something I'm sure you know nothing of." The worst from Nihlithak? "What are you still doing here? I thought you were going off to die. Go...Be quick about it."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, your character is verbally trodden upon regularly by computer characters. Many of the quests involve menial tasks with lots of time-consuming running around, to the point that the game develepors (Jagex) treat it as an in-joke. In some of the quests, your character will say things along the lines of "Let me guess, you want me to run around all over Runescape to get some easily-obtainable item?" And some of the computer characters inspire true hatred with their constant refusal to recognise your contributions/good work/single-handed saving of everyone.
</li><li> Reimu Hakurei of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> has saved Gensokyo from everything from minor annoyances to potentially apocalyptic destruction multiple times, yet the humans ignore her (at best), the youkai mooch off of her (at best) and she has no worshippers whatsoever at the Hakurei shrine. Indeed, most residents genuinely <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold">don't know</a></em> that Reimu has stopped most of the regular incidents, and those that do are either too stupid to recognise they should give her respect or too powerful too even bother. This is most apparent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouSuzunaanForbiddenScrollery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouSuzunaanForbiddenScrollery">Forbidden Scrollery</a></em>, where despite being Gensokyo's top youkai hunter none of the humans know who she is and have no confidence in her solving the current youkai problem (expect for Kosuzu who is a blatant Reimu fangirl, with Reimu having no idea how to react to someone genuinely praising her).
</li><li> During the ending sequence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Prince Charmles does not allow the protagonist to attend his royal wedding</span>, despite having saved the world, being close friends with the bride, being captain of his father-in-law to be's royal guard <em>and</em> having personally helped the prince in an earlier part of the story, on account of the hero and his friends being "commoners." Weirdly this is averted most of the time, as people acknowledge that you and your friends have helped them in the past. This behavior also bites him in the ass, as no matter which ending you get <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Medea runs off and marries the main character. It's worse in the ending for completing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> dungeon, where not only does he lose his bride, but also the throne to the person who he just banned from his wedding</span>. Guess the lesson is 'treat people with respect when they help you'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Somehow, the fact that the player eventually becomes the League Champion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">the hero</a> who liberated the region from a criminal syndicate and saved the world does not impress many of the game's NPCs, who treat you pretty much the same as any other eleven-year-old Trainer. Made worse by how <em>your own mother</em> has absolutely nothing to say, ever, about you beating the best Trainers in the entire region (though that's not to imply she's not proud of you). <em>Some</em> people will recognise you, but for the most part you're still often treated like the average trainer. Starting with Gen 5 there is more of an effort to make you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">Famed in Story</a> but there are still numerous points where the protagonist is treated like anyone else. Gen 8 got much better about it, with the Pokémon center lady and the Pokè mart person addressing your character as the champion and you can overhear it from some NPCs, but its still not fully averted.
</li><li> None of the in-game trainers even bat an eye when you send out Pokémon thought to be long extinct or urban legend, legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a> Pokémon that are the only one of their kind in existence, or even Pokémon that are <em>believed to be God</em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigAdventure">Little Big Adventure</a> II</em>, you have a museum dedicated to you and your heroic deeds from the original game... which you are forced to <em>pay for entering</em>, because the ticket vendor is an idiot who doesn't recognize you (he <em>does</em> note that you "look like the guy in the picture" <em>after</em> you don the Ancestral Tunic — and that's it). If you talk to the museum owner, Twinsen will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">complain</a> about that.

It's typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> Adol getting no respect, with him usually getting stranded in the middle of nowhere and being saved by people from a small village that may not have gotten any news for decades.

<ul><li> The Exile, despite being a Jedi and a war veteran, a surprisingly large amount of people you encounter think you're puny and incompetent next to them, such as when you spar with the handmaidens or the Mandalorians. Admittedly, you do get to gradually build up their respect with your accomplishments, but there are still a few who look down their noses at you.
</li><li> Jedi in general. While a Jedi Knight certainly isn't invincible, and they've been getting thrashed by the Sith for years, only an idiot wouldn't respect their power (we are talking about a group of people who can lift heavy object with their minds, heal wounds instantly, possess lightning quick reflexes and swords that can cut through almost anything), yet most people you encounter in the game will think of Jedi as absolute pushovers. You encounter a pair of women on Dantooine who look like nothing more than simple farmers, who seem to seriously consider taking on a Jedi to collect on the bounty.

For instance, when playing as a Sith Inquisitor (who starts off as a recently-freed slave), you get treated like crap by pretty much everyone except your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> future master until about the time you finish the Prologue. Throughout Act I, you receive more and more recognition (especially from the Imperial Intelligence, who know everything about everyone) and most quest givers approach you primarily because of your reputation as an unstoppable, lightning-flinging death machine. By Act II, you are already firmly entrenched in the Imperial noble caste, with all due benefits.

<ul><li> In a meta-example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaV">Ultima V</a></em>. Called to Brittania in response to a major crisis, the Avatar defeats the Shadowlords, subverts Blackthorne's regime, journeys deep into the depths of the underworld to free Lord British, and paves the way for his return to the throne. His reward? He returns home to earth to find that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">his house has been robbed while he was out.</a> Being the Avatar apparently makes you the universe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewToy">Chew Toy</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">Ultima VI</a></em> you are the Avatar, most likely Britannia's most legendary hero ever, and some people who recognize you do sing your praises. And your first order of business is to reclaim the shrines and purify them, for which you'll need the eight runes. The runes which you spent the fourth game tracking down everywhere, and which should now be locked up as national treasures. Except people apparently pass them around everywhere, and has lost or hidden or dropped some of them. The Rune of Sacrifice in particular is held by the guild leader of Minoc, and he'll give it to you... when you become a member. Which you can only become by performing "Stones" on a set of pipes. Which you need to have someone make for you. Who will need you to provide the wood. And so on. Yes, you're a legendary hero who is busy trying to stop an invasion and save the world for the <em>sixth</em> time now, but this guy still expects you to jump through hoops for no reason beyond propriety.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaUnderworld">Ultima Underworld</a></em> you are suspected of kidnapping a baron's daughter. Though you claim you are the Avatar the baron doesn't recognize or believe you with the only explanation being that several years had passed since you were last in Britannia. Again, you are <em>the Avatar</em>, the man who not only saved the world <em>six times</em> by this point but is also the <em>Messiah of the only organized religion in the world</em>. You'd think that <em>everyone</em> in the entire planet would know what the Avatar <em>looks like.</em> The baron then sends you to the Abyss on a mission to rescue his daughter. He notes that if you are really the Avatar, this is your thing, and not only should you be able to get her back, you should feel obligated to do it. If you're lying, you'll get what you deserve.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em>, the title character spends the entire game in the same city (and the nearby dungeon). When the Bonne's show up and start destroying the city, the Mayor asks Mega Man to go out and stop them. He does so, and instead of medals or parades, they ask him to donate money to rebuild the city. After you collect money for them, they ask for more. The entire city would be a smoking ruin several times over without Mega Man's intervention, and he never gets so much as a "thank you."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkReign">Dark Reign</a> 2</em>, in the JDA mission you have spent the last 10 missions fighting the Sprawlers, and evacuating civilians. Then you are ordered to stay behind to destroy the artifacts, which will destroy Earth itself, while the JDA go on to become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Imperium</a>.

In <em>13th Skull</em>, you travel to Louisiana to investigate a disappearance, and run into a slew of characters who have chunks of information you need to solve the case. In spite of your badge and authority, almost <em>none</em> of them will tell you much of anything until you've performed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a> for them. (The lone exception requires you to beat him at checkers before he'll help you, but after that he's perfectly friendly and useful.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGameOfTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGameOfTheAges">The Game of the Ages</a></em>, you'd think your status would change after lifting the town's curse. Not particularly.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpellcastingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSpellcastingSeries">The Spellcasting Series</a></em>, as hero Ernie Eaglebeak saves the world on a yearly basis and gets nothing but a trophy for his troubles. With his name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">misspelled on it.</a>
</li><li> While the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> subverted this by causing you to become increasingly respected as you advanced through the plot and ranks, the sequel plays this particularly straight. Both Michael and others belittle you even when you've proven yourself capable of mowing down whole enemy Families.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em>:
<ul><li> Overlapping with being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpopularPopularCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpopularPopularCharacter">Unpopular Popular Character</a>, Laharl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">Disgaea: Hour of Darkness</a></em> is treated as a joke in every cameo appearance he makes. Granted, he heavily suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a> and Flanderization, but, he always appears as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, i.e, threats faced during the main game that are played seriously are nowhere near as strong as he is, but he's always treated as a joke. The exception is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Disgaea 2</a></em>, where he serves as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> that's generally impossible unless playing on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, but despite easily defeating the game's entire cast when he first appears, he's still treated as a a joke in the game's sidequests. This continues even into <em>Disgaea Dimension 2</em>, a direct sequel to the original game, where half the Netherworld seems to be unaware of his status as Overlord, and the group trying to instate their own Overlord doesn't consider him to be a threat.
</li><li> Standard fare for demons and particularly overlords who, for all their power and ability, are incredibly childish, petty and stupid. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em>, practically everyone made fun of Zetta even <em>before</em> he's crippled by being bound to the Sacred Tome, and it gets worse after that. This is the guy who claimed the title of Most Powerful Overlord In The Entire Cosmos, and whose foot soldiers can, with a bit of creative leveling and tactics, beat the snot out of other <em>overlords</em> and draft them into service.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em>:
<ul><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood">Brotherhood</a></em> just after Ezio returns to Monteriggioni he meets a young woman who asks him to carry her things up to the mansion for her. During the walk she is very flirtatious and talks at length about Ezio's faults, not realizing that the handsome young man carrying her things <em>is</em> Ezio. This is especially odd because A) Ezio is essentially the Lord of Monteriggioni, and B) the young woman is best friends with Ezio's sister Claudia. It might be explained by the fact that during the events of the previous game (which ended minutes before the start of this one), Ezio apparently spent months or even years at a stretch in Florence, Venice, or Rome, not in Monteriggioni. If there wasn't a family portrait on the wall somewhere, it's entirely possible that the woman in question has never seen Ezio's face before - though many other NPCs in the town appear to recognize him on sight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em> James Barrett calls Connor a boy and initially asks him to get out of the way of the fighting. And when talking about going after Pitcairn, Sam Adams doubts Connor's ability, saying that a thousand troops stand in the way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">You should have cut down hundreds by now...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Played various ways in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> series. For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, your uncle (the police chief) is very suspicious of your seeming involvement with the murders and kidnappings, whereas your friends frequently praise you for your work in saving the victims. You get very little respect outside that, but for a good reason; <em>no-one else knows that you're saving people's lives</em>. Your protagonist also tends to get praise for helping others in social links, and their gratitude turns into energy for Personas.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OFF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OFF">OFF</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix">Japhet</a>, guardian, creator and sovereign of zone 2, only wanted his citizens to acknowledge him and be thankful for making them and their abodes. They, in response, proceeded to forget who he even was. The result? One <em>very pissed off</em> phoenix trying to raze the entire area with an army of ghosts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em> you actually get an example of this from <em>yourself</em>. Your journal speaks in awe of Herr von Claussen, a Rheinlander ace who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">scored over 500 kills</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneGetsLeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneGetsLeftBehind">never lost a wingman</a>. By the point that entry is written, a typical player's kill count is in the mid-400s, and thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAllyImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAllyImmortality">Gameplay Ally Immortality</a> <em>you've</em> never lost a wingman either!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire">L.A. Noire</a></em>, it doesn't matter how much goodwill Cole Phelps builds up over the first few sections of the game. As soon as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's caught visiting Elsa Lichtmann</span> at the end of his time on Ad-Vice, he gets suspended and is forced to completely rebuild his reputation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has many people sending you on quests doing menial and tedious tasks, such as fetching wine for someone or slaying some monsters, even though your character tells them that he/she defeated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ifrit</span> already and needs to find the group of people that defeated a god so that you can learn how to beat it yourself. You eventually find out the trope is subverted when all the people you been doing the boring side quests for are actually the group that defeated the god you're trying to defeat yourself and they tell you that they were testing you to make sure you were just not another adventurer trying to make a name for himself. The trope is played with and explored further in the Dark Knight quests in <em>Heavensward</em> where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you get to see how ungrateful the people of Eorzea can be when you do menial tasks for them. As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime">Heroic Mime</a>, you naturally can't express how you really feel. With Fray, your job trainer, s/he eventually vents out their anger and annoyance at everyone who seemingly takes advantage of you and offers nothing in return. However, you find out that Fray is actually a part of your psyche that represents all of your negative emotions that were building up since the end of the 2.5 story, so it was actually <em>you</em> expressing your disgust towards everyone.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> ties <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel">Character Level</a> to your player character's military rank in Starfleet, the Klingon Defense Force, or the Romulan Republican Force. This is tolerable up to level 39 (Captain or equivalent and below), but after that, not only are you an admiral running around in a ship, but by the time you hit the level cap at 60 (Fleet Admiral), you actually <em>outrank</em> every mission giver in the entire game giver except Fleet Admiral Quinn, Chancellor J'mpok, and Admiral Kererek, and have probably seen more combat in the last year than some of them have in their entire careers. And yet O-7s and below still love to order you around like you're a totally green ensign and in some cases force you to personally complete tasks more suited to junior enlisted personnel. (One major exception is Captain Harry Kim in the <em>Delta Rising</em> expansion, who makes a point of treating the PC with the respect due his superior officer.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">back and forth</a> with this. Each of the major characters has someone in their life that treats them this way, be they spoiled brat kids that don't understand the realities of dad's life, chronically inept best friends that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">keep making deals with people who have actively tried to get them killed</a>, or a mother that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">still treats them like a worthless, snot-nosed toddler</a>. That's to say nothing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Steve Haines</a> who actually <em>knows</em> how much of a psychotic killer each of the three playable characters are, but also knows full well that he's got each of them by the balls and can blackmail them to do whatever he wants. He suffers from this himself, though, as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">completely snaps</a> if he feels he's not being paid enough respect. Despite all of this, anyone who ISN'T an explicit asshole just using you for their grungiest of work shows you the amount of respect you rightfully deserve, and some of the biggest violators actually get over themselves by the end of the game, notably Micheal's family (mostly.)
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastDream">Last Dream</a></em>. Through most of the game, the various quest-givers and NPC's either disregard the main characters or treat them with contempt, even after they've done things like rescue the King of Doria or defeat the Kraken using the normal method (using <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Medusa's head to turn it to stone</span>). However, doing certain sidequests or taking alternate paths result in NPC's throughout the game world treating you with awe or respect. Notably, during the Hunter's Guild quests, the guild leader(s) become so impressed with your skills that they dispatch you to start fighting <em>urban legends</em>, and if you beat all four of them, the Guild Correspondents and guild leader admit that you are the greatest warrior to ever live.

However, your team will be all praise for the ADC, Toplaner and Midlaner (again, the roles might have different names in other MOBAS) while you sit behind your screen getting no praise at all. In recent times, at least in League, it got better and many people watching others play (on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitch">Twitch</a></em> for example) pay their respects to well-played supports/junglers, but it was a hard way there.
</li><li> Luigi in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> games tends to be hit with this on numerous occasions.

Lack of respect for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Royce Bracket</a>'s avant-garde, static architectural designs in a society based around change is what causes him to seek out the Transistor, ultimately leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo">Grey Goo</a> when he loses control of it.

More so in the first game than in the second, but NPCs in both games will ask you to take a break from saving the world for a bit in order to help them do stuff. Somewhat averted overall in that very few NPCs actually demand the player's help, instead requesting it if they're not busy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> in PoTZ  while everyone in-game is more or less aware of what the player's busy with, they'll sometimes recommend taking a moment to relax (in the form of either playing games in the arcade or solving puzzles that have been put together for them). Only one NPC in the game actually asks the player for help that's unrelated to the main quest.

If you imported your character, you can have a nine-foot list of achievements including ending the Blight, slaying multiple dragons and dragon-shaped entities, helping to recover the Chantry's single most sacred artifact, resolving two different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">succession crises</a>, saving more or less the entire population of Ferelden, being the effective Arl of Aramanthine, and (depending on your choice of character origin) <em>being the Prince-Consort or Queen of Ferelden</em>. While many people will at least pay lip service to your being possibly the worst person to piss off in the entirety of Thedas, you still get quests like random nobody smugglers asking you to scare the local innkeeper into opening his end of the secret passage again. Pleasantly enough, you can at least tell the smuggler in question to go and stick it up his jumper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElseHeartBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElseHeartBreak">Else Heart Break</a></em> suffers from this due to the complexity of its underlying system. If you already know some programming (or if you are just curious and learn about it yourself in sandbox play) you can become <em>ridiculously</em> powerful and bypass many obstacles, but the Lodge will never acknowledge this and will send you on simple missions and even make plot points of hazards you have already disabled. No matter how well you do, it's always implied that the Lodge are better hackers than you, even though if that's the case they should literally be able to do anything they want utterly unopposed - because you can.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> games and books, the titular witchers are often treated with mistrust and fear by the populace, if not outright scorn and hatred, due to a combination of superstition, genuine fear of things that aren't human, religious fanaticism, and a reputation tarnished by an ugly history. That being said, witchers are also viewed as heroes by many where they've saved lives and villages by slaying monsters. Geralt of Rivia himself is a paradox of loathing and respect; in one town he'll be hailed as a hero and dine with a king for helping reverse a curse on his family, and in the next he'll be openly threatened by the guards and denounced by the priests for being an inhuman mutant.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em>, the leader of a rival civilization will give you very little respect. They will offer trades that grossly favor them, and even demand you simply give them things. This even if you've conquered every other civilization in the game, your empire occupies a swath of land five times as big as theirs, your army is ten times as large, and your technology is decades ahead of theirs.
</li><li> Gaige in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em> built a bionic arm and quickly-digistructable robot for a <em>high school science fair</em>, and came third because the school <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>'s family bribed the judges.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>: Usually averted, as the title character is stated to be a world-renown hero, and his fame is usually acknowledged by people upon first meeting him. However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>, he's still forced to do a number of random tasks for the Soleanna citizens in order advance in his quest to save Elise, the nation's ruler, from Dr. Eggman. It gets particularly bad when the royal guards' captain refuses to let him continue unless he plays and wins a mind game. Upon solving it, he reveals that he specifically did it in order to stop civilians (i.e. Sonic) from getting involved in the matter. Never mind that Sonic had a far better track record at dealing with Eggman and saving the world than authorities, or that, again, he was a world famous hero.
</li><li> The Ring Genie from Revolve8: Episodic Dueling is a prime example of this, constantly overshadowed by his more famous older brother, the Genie of the Lamp. This is especially exemplified in his own storyline where he not only saved an entire village from being flooded (which his brother was given credit for), but he also helped Aladdin escape from the cave and helped him free the Lamp Genie from the clutches of an evil wizard, yet hardly anyone knows who he is (let alone that Aladdin has two genies).
</li><li> This kind of treatment gets parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoxxyQuestTheGatheringStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoxxyQuestTheGatheringStorm">BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm</a></em>. When we first meet Shift, hes living in a filthy, cluttered warren down in the sewers. Later, in the epilogue, after hes joined the party and helped save the world from certain annihilation at the hands of STORM hes still living there, and he's still on the run from the law.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>:
<ul><li> In any of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">the first three games</a>, Phoenix is respected by almost NOBODY except his friends/assistants (and even then they may make fun of him), even though he's solved cases that were unsolved for years, and gotten EVERY SINGLE ONE of his clients a Not Guilty (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except Matt Engarde, but he really was guilty so it was all good</span>) in his entire short career. The prosecution (understandable), witnesses (also understandable, especially if they did it), the police, and even the judge respects every prosecutor in court (even the ones that whip him and insult him), and they never cease to tell Phoenix that the only reason he wins is because of luck or his old mentor helping him. This eventually reaches a head in the fourth game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where this is one of the reasons Kristoph set Phoenix up to lose his badge; he thought Phoenix was beneath him and used the forged evidence to frame him</span>. Ultimately averted for Phoenix in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Dual Destinies</a></em>, where he has been elevated to living legend in the legal world.
</li><li> This seems to have been passed onto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice</a> as well since almost everyone seems to put him down for being a loud rookie with two "horns"/spikes on his hair.
</li><li> Edgeworth himself, who has been praised by many people in game, got roughly the same treatment when he played for the Defense (he even wondered if there was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickMePrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickMePrank">"Kick Me" sign</a> on his side of the court). And in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">his own spin-offs</a> all the witnesses and potential suspects go out of their way to be unhelpful as possible and Edgeworth's sidekick, Kay, seems to try and be annoying as possible to Edgeworth in public. It's even worse in the sequel, when, despite DISMANTLING A CRIME SYNDICATE that had been evading police for 10 years over the course of TWO DAYS a mere two weeks earlier, Edgeworth spends the entire game dealing with the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, which seems determined to get his badge revoked so that he can be replaced with a 17-year-old who resident idiot Larry Butz considers stupid. Somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> though because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">said 17-year-old is the son of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Chair of the PIC and former Chief Prosecutor</a>, who hates Edgeworth's guts and is directly responsible for the whole PIC mess.</span>
<ul><li> Also in the second Edgeworth game, we have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"President Di-Jun Huang", who is not the real Huang, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble">Body Double</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">had the real one assassinated over 10 years prior and took his place</a>. His reason for doing this was that he was sick of putting himself in danger all the time and getting no recognition for it</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Ironically, despite dealing with a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt">Witch</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Court</a>, Phoenix actually does a lot better in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsAceAttorney">Professor Layton vs. Ace Attorney</a></em> after winning his first witch trial (he was severely mocked in the first). At the beginning of the second one, the Judge and the prosecutor acknowledge his skill out loud, as he'd, well, gotten basically the only Not Guilty verdict in the history of Witch Court. They don't go easy on him, but they admit that he knows what he's doing, which is more than he ever got in real court.

He's shocked that they remember something like that, given how long it took him to achieve similar adoration from the NCR.

<ul><li> Zig-Zagged with Aang. On one side, a lot of people just think he's a naive kid and often throw criticism towards him for neglecting his duties, accidentally or not. On the <em>other</em> side, being the Avatar is still a respected position and even the most important people in the country will speak with him. The Fire Nation also have a great respect for him... so they send their best soldiers to kill him.
</li><li> This gets somewhat egregious in the followup comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderThePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderThePromise">The Promise</a></em>. Sokka and Toph are trying to calm a crowd of angry Earth Kingdom villagers who want the Fire Nation out. So what happens when Sokka speaks up for them to chill out? He gets nailed in the head with a rock and called a "Water Tribe savage". And to think, one year ago he was instrumental in keeping the entire Earth Kingdom from being incinerated, taking out an entire dirigible <em>fleet</em>.

This is initially due to her habit of bad first impressions, where she tended to do more harm than good, combined with being secluded from the world for her entire adolescence and the world's changing views on politics and opinion of needing an Avatar. Despite her best efforts however, most leaders continue to outright look down on Korra, dismiss her requests for aid, and sometimes outright work against her throughout the course of the series. Even during the final season, if Korra can't immediately solve a problem, she'll be ignored. This is most egregious in the episode "Beyond the Wilds" where a conference of world leaders included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Prince Wu</a> who was invited although he had literally nothing at all to contribute aside from his claim to the throne, but they left out Korra, the Avatar and the Keeper of Balance. Even her mentor Tenzin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">accidentally treats</a> her rather poorly. Apparently, Prince Wu was the only one who actually thought Korra should have been invited.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> is by no means "Mr. Popular" and is obviously cut off by everyone around him, his family included, mostly due to his vast intellect. He also mistakenly gets into trouble that are beyond his contol or he didn't do in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em>: Courage had constantly put his life on the line to rescue his co-owner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan">Eustace</a>, yet the latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">never treats him any better or appreciates his help</a>. It eventually got to the point where Eustace tried to have Courage <em>killed</em> by his past enemies despite everything the dog did for him.
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> deals with this constantly. Yes, he is an absolute egotist who's primary motivation as a superhero is to receive a great deal of fame and glory, but he's practically saved Saint Canard (and the world sometimes) from just about every threat imaginable. Yet, more often than not, he gets practically little, if any respect, whatsoever; just the occasional thank you from S.H.U.S.H. and perhaps the gratitude of a few innocent bystanders, but certainly not from Saint Canard itself. Sometimes, the city even gives him a hard time inspire of all he's done.
<ul><li> His rebooted counterpart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ducktales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ducktales2017">Ducktales 2017</a></em> seems to have this a little better, but perhaps not by much. His primary motivation here is mostly to serve as an inspiration for others, much in the same way the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">the original Darkwing Duck series</a> was for him, but he doesn't get off to the smoothest starts. When he takes up the identity full time, he's barely given notice when he helps to save the Earth from invading forces from the Moon (well, aside from Launchpad), and even this ends up exploited when Scrooge switches costumes with him to try and foil General Lunaris. And when he gets his own lair in Saint Canard? No crime whatsoever, thanks to Mayor Zan Owlson's efficient leadership. He's only given respect when he stops Gosalyn from breaking in to Taurus Bulba's lab, even getting the key to the city. Yet, he manages to save the city in the end, and who gets all the credit? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis">Gizmoduck</a>.

Take the episode "You Can't Do That On Television Peter" for example. After Peter suffers a near-fatal attack in the sharp claws of a puma during his act on television, Meg uses her doctor techniques to save Peter's life. After Peter wakes up from his consciousness in the hospital, he refuses to thank Meg for saving his life, and no one else gives her any adulation for it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> episode "Godfellahs'', even God himself (or at least a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicEntity">Cosmic Entity</a> whom Bender identifies as God) claims that mortals rarely appreciate him for what He does, and always want more. What God says probably sums up this Trope pretty well: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">"When you do something right, people won't think you've done anything at all."</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ron gets no respect from his peers or enemies, despite his key role in regularly going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheWorld">Save the World</a> with Kim. That being said, even she doesn't get much slack from people on the home front for all the times she's saved them all from doom.
</li><li> Ironically, Drakken gets this as well. Despite the fact he's probably come closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">succeeding</a> than any other villain, he has trouble getting people to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred">take him seriously</a> and is sometimes mistaken for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Professor Dementor</a>. This is lampshaded in a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a> episodes, in which other villains break his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">Hypercompetent Sidekick</a> Shego out of prison while leaving him to rot.

It's Comedy Relief (Porky) and his toy soldier that brings the beast down, so as the townsfolk laud him:
<div class="indent"><strong>Daffy:</strong> Hey, what's going on? Put down that Comedy Relief! <em>I'm</em> the hero of this picture! Give <em>me</em> the applause! Give <em>me</em> the cheers! Give me...(<em>running out of steam</em>) give me one dozen roses.

Even Stormer's <em>brother</em> was oblivious to the rivalry between the two bands when he tried out to be Jem's new drummer.
</li><li> A villainous example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestTheRealAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestTheRealAdventures">Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>, Lorenzo, is fairly competent and unflinchingly loyal; his only flaw is being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a>.

In one episode, after he saves Surd from cardiac arrest, Julia goes, "Jeremiah! Thank the stars that you're alive!" Lorenzo retorts, "The stars had nothing to do with it", but they ignore him.
</li><li> In the animated version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>, Link suffers from this in a different way than described in the video game section. In the cartoon, it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess">Zelda herself</a></em> who refuses to accord Link any respect. She's often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">nasty to him</a>; she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">compares him unfavorably</a> to another wandering hero; she almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">never thanks him for his protection</a>; and when things are quiet in the kingdom, she forces him to earn his keep by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">doing chores and maintenance around the castle</a>. To add insult to injury, her father the King genuinely likes Link, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor">can't seem to remember his name</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>: Cat Noir, Ladybug's partner, is routinely subject of that by villains, some civilians and by Ladybug herself.

It's much harder to write a plot about learning to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">Be Yourself</a> despite social pressure when social pressure would be nearly nonexistent should everyone consider you a hero.
<ul><li> Even outside of hero work, by the end of the series, members of the main cast gain great success in fashion, military and stunt work, teaching, etc. Still no outside of Ponyville seems to recognize them most of the time, while their hometown only ever holds them in high esteem within the context of their far more mundane day jobs, as they quickly came to see the regular dangers that the group saves the town from as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">Unusually Uninteresting Sights</a>. Even Twilight, protégé to the country's ruler and who was apart of the royal family through her brother before gaining a princess title in her own right, usually only gets her royal status noted when the plot explicitly requires it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> with Spike. The character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> who tends to do a lot of menial labor for his friends without any hesitation and often little thanks, and is subsequently overlooked by everyone else in Equestria. In the Crystal Empire however, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend">Living Legend</a> with the title of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent">The Great and Honorable Spike</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryToFitThatOnABusinessCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryToFitThatOnABusinessCard">the Brave and Glorious</a>", due to playing a key role in saving the region in a season three episode, and is always praised by the masses as soon as he steps foot in its capital city.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a> in the season five finale, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the season time travels and breaks up the Mane Six in response to them helping ruin her scheme during the premiere. This results in various timelines where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWorld">different villains have won and are ruling the world</a>. When she's confronted with one of these timelines (the destruction of Equestria was <em>not</em> something she wanted), she is unable to wrap around her head how breaking apart the bond of six random ponies could cause so much death and destruction. In other words, even the villains can forget how important they are, and she nearly ends up paying for that mistake. Granted, she did spent several years living in the desert...
</li><li> Averted and <em>deconstructed</em> in the season seven episode "Fame And Misfortune". The Mane Six decide to publish their Friendship Journal (kept from Season 4) and give it to the other Ponies in Equestria to read, hoping they would take their lessons and use them to better themselves. The Mane Six become instant overnight celebrities. They are famous far and wide, and everyone knows them. Unfortunately, the ponies miss the point of the journal entries and start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">harassing them</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">to no end</a>. After being put through the wringer several times over by their adoring "fans", it would be safe to assume the Mane Six wouldn't mind going back to being widely ignored.
</li></ul></li><li> Played absolutely straight in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>. The girls had a full week of baddie stompin', city savin', and other matters that involved super heroines. However, the citizens get more and more demanding, each task more menial than the next, until the girls took no more and went on strike. Said tasks included carrying groceries, opening jars of pickles, and <em>cleaning cat litter.</em> Ironically, a monster attacked at that moment of the strike. The girls had to coach the town in defending themselves...and was responsible for pre-party cleanup afterwards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em>. Sure, Mordecai and Rigby are the embodiment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>, but they still clean up their own messes, save the park, and on some occasions, Benson's life. He usually repays them by threatening to fire them if they don't get back to work. This is because Benson suffers this to a larger extent from his boss, Pops' dad and the owner of the park.
</li><li> This and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a> comes up frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a>.</em> The people of Crystal Cove berate the gang in unmasking monsters, because they believe the monsters make good tourist attractions, even if the monsters endanger their lives.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, the core family was at least tangentially responsible for every major event in Springfield, and while other characters might remember them for some specific thing in a previous episode, that's all that they're known for. They might even be remembered in another episode by the same character for something completely different. That being said, they are the cause of just as many problems as they are of good deeds, if not more, so the townsfolk may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by not giving them the time of day. Always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, there are some specific cases where one character calls out another for not remembering a Simpsons family member:
<ul><li> The second time Bart meets up with Krusty the Clown, Krusty dismisses Bart as a nobody and brushes him off until Bart has to remind him that he saved Krusty from an attempted murder by Sideshow Bob. Even then, Krusty only reluctantly agrees to listen to Bart. This had become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>, that Krusty never remembers Bart, and a character trait of his, that Krusty doesn't remember or care who helps him.
</li><li> There was one instance where Mr. Burns asks Smithers about Homer Simpson's identity, and Smithers points out that everything important that has happened to Mr. Burns in the last several years was tied to Homer in some way. This does not change Mr. Burns's outlook on Homer in the slightest, though it does disappoint Smithers slightly. Smithers seems to be an aversion though: He is genuinely aware of what Homer has done and remembers it, trusting Homer enough to substitute as Mr. Burns's assistant in "Homer the Smithers" when Smithers goes on vacation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>: No matter how often Sonic saves them from Eggman, the inhabitants of Bygone Island always seem prepared to believe the worst in him and turn on him at the drop of a hat over anything, no matter how large or small. In "Just a Guy," it reaches a point where Sonic goes off on a rant over it and goes into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">10-Minute Retirement</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Sonic</strong>: You know what I think is "compassionate?" Saving the village from Eggman! Like, every week! But do I get any props for that? No! Everyone just goes around gasping at me whenever I call a guy a "guy," or people "people!"

They believed it was for their cause to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeLucasAlteredVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeLucasAlteredVersion">George Lucas Altered Versions</a> of movies (having survived the premiere of a version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> with unnecessary changes), but it turns out they were being thanked for their other, less important cause of pardoning a proven child murderer (which they had reluctantly adopted to keep members of their club around). The boys leave with the mindset that what doesn't matter now would matter later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> Deconstructed in "The Beast Within", where it's clearly shown during the fight against Adonis that Beast Boy has deep anger issues because of the lack of appreciation from the other Titans, and during the fight all of his repressed anger goes out and he totally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomps</a> Adonis, much to the shock of the other Titans.
</li><li> Played for laughs at the start of season 5. Cyborg rescues Elasti-Girl, only for her to refer to him as "whoever you are". Cyborg is quick to show annoyance, noting that he's saved the world several times already.
</li><li> The Doom Patrol, Beast Boy's former team, seem to view the Titans as bratty rebel teenagers who don't know what kind of trouble they're getting in to. They really don't seem to know that the Titans fought villains just as dangerous as their arch enemies, the Brotherhood of Evil, including one maniacal demon that was <em>very</em> close to taking over the world.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em>: Despite proving again and again that he's the only one who has what it takes to be a good leader, Leo notes that his brothers only seem to follow his lead when they feel like doing so. In "New Girl in Town," it reaches the point where Leo gets sick and tired of constantly being second-guessed and not getting any appreciation for his efforts that he decides to let Raph be leader for a change.
</li><li> Played with in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LennyBruce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LennyBruce">Lenny Bruce</a>'s <em>Thank You Mask Man</em> (both the cartoon and the stand-up comedy routine it was based on). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheLoneRanger">title character</a> initially disdains expressions of respect and reward, but once a little boy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">thanks him</a> he decides he likes it and demands more respect from the townspeople.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Harold</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>. He has helped his teams in numerous occasions and even saved a part of the campers from near-certain death. And yet, he hardly gets any respect, especially from Duncan, and to a lesser extent, from almost anyone else. Oh, and he is most likely the cause of a lot of the lack of respect towards him, but that's another story.
</li><li> Optimus Prime in his incarnation on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, despite managing to survive several encounters with Megatron and the Decepticons and preventing them from getting their hands on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin">All Spark</a> with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchofMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchofMisfits">Ragtag Bunchof Misfits</a>, rarely has his great deeds acknowledged by his superiors on Cybertron due to his position as an Elite Guard washout and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">assigned to the unglamorous position of the leader of a Space Bridge repair crew</a>. It is only at final episode that he and his crew get the kind of respect they deserved.
</li><li> Raimundo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em> is constantly on the receiving end of his peers' (and occasionally his mentors') disrespect, despite the numerous times he's proved himself/been completely right. At first, it's deconstructed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when it goes far enough that it drives Raimundo into making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a></span>. Then it gets reconstructed later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Raimundo uses that attitude to convincingly <em>pretend</em> to pull the same thing again as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> for the good guys</span>. And finally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it gets fully subverted at the series finale, when Raimundo's accomplishments get recognition, culminating in him being appointed leader of the Xiaolin Dragons, over the more traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">hero</a> Omi.</span>

<ul><li> In Russia, this has been the case for veterans of the Great Patriotic War (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> as experienced by the Soviet Union), which are rapidly forgotten for now and get only formal respect. <em>Frontovichka</em> ("front-line girls") especially were Soviet Union women who participated in WWII, who came home to public scorn and were erased from history; the name <em>frontovichka</em> became a terrible insult (on the level of "whore"). Many women who fought had been granted medals, but were forced to hide their accomplishments to protect themselves afterwards. Russians and other former Soviet states as a whole feel that the rest of the world neglects or undermines their contributions and hardships during the war, despite numbering the highest in civilian and military casualties and contributing more to the downfall of the Nazis than any other single nation.
</li><li> Nikola Tesla. Mostly due to actions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Thomas Edison</a>, his reputation was ruined, and he never got the Nobel Prize for Physics he deserved even though his research was the basis of much of 20th century electricity-driven technology. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Until a popularity surge many decades after his death</a>, he was barely mentioned in history books.
</li><li> James Clerk Maxwell was a British 19th century physicist who laid down the foundation for Einsteinian Relativity and basic quantum mechanics by demonstrating that light is formed of electromagnetic waves, but few people have ever heard of him. Some scientists believe that if he hadn't died of cancer at age 48, he might have beaten Einstein to the theory of Special Relativity by around 4 decades. In fact, Maxwell's Four Equations are a solution to Einstein's Special Relativity's equations, so in effect Einstein proved Maxwell correct (as far as his equations went, but disproved him in terms of requiring an ether).
</li><li> Benedict Arnold was one of the best U.S. generals during the American Revolution and in particular his victory at Saratoga (in which he displayed both great skill and extraordinary bravery) was <em>the</em> turning point in the war, one of several occasions his insights and leadership turned the tide of battles <em>after</em> he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanStillFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanStillFight">suffered crippling wounds</a>. While Arnold probably didn't help his case by being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">generally unpleasant to his fellow officers and openly claiming to be the best general on either side of the war</a> (the possibility that he might have been <em>right</em> doing nothing to quell his ego), he was constantly passed over for commendations and promotions in favor of politically motivated selections, and generally treated like shit by his (often less competent) superiors. From a historical perspective, his becoming a turncloak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal">is quite understandable</a>. Ironically, after his defection Arnold was rewarded by the British with a commission of brigadier general, a reduction from his Continental Army position of major general. He was treated with contempt by his superior, Sir Henry Clinton, and mistrusted by his subordinates because they considered him a traitor—both to Great Britain <em>and</em> to the colonists. In other words, he received a lesser version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewardedAsATraitorDeserves">Rewarded as a Traitor Deserves</a>...
</li><li> During the golden era of heavyweight boxing, the now late boxing legend Joe Frazier had to struggle and earn the heavyweight championship the hard way. However, he was always in the shadow of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> whom many people believed was still the true champion. Frazier, at first, still liked Ali and even gave him some money during his boxing exile and helped him get his boxing license back, so the two can finally fight. How was he thanked for this? Ali went on a bashing campaign, calling Frazier some of the worst names he'd ever call an opponent. To make matters worst, the boxing fans and even the media, mostly took Ali's side and joined in ridiculing Frazier. After the two fought for the first time and Frazier won, the crowed still chanted for Ali. When Frazier fought and lost his title badly to George Foreman, the most played back clip of the fight, was the one where Howard Cosell said "Down Goes Frazier!." It's still a well known statement today. Over time, however, people began to feel sorry for Frazier and even got on Ali for his cruel ways back then, forcing him to apologize. Today, Frazier is considered just as great as Ali, but for different reasons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodneyDangerfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodneyDangerfield">Rodney Dangerfield</a> made this his main schtick. Ironically, his "I don't get no respect" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpopularPopularCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpopularPopularCharacter">is precisely what has made him so popular and renowned by the public</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> apparently suffered some of this (being <em>just</em> the drummer), to the point where he walked out on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> during their infamous White Album sessions. They got on without him by getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> to fill in, but ultimately sent him a telegram telling him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">how much they needed him.</a> George even decorated his drum kit with flowers when he came back, and before the band performed their final concert on the rooftop, Paul left him a card saying "You're the best drummer in the world."
</li><li> Similar to the above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl">Dave Grohl</a> cites this as the reason he learned guitar. Back when he was on a world tour with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>, they were all given nametags in Germany. Grohl noticed that his tag said something different than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> and Krist Novoselic's. When he asked their guide, he explained that theirs said "Musician." Grohl then asked what his said, and has told "Drummer."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RafaelNadal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RafaelNadal">Rafael Nadal</a> has more French Open titles than anyone in the history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">tennis</a>, but is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">The Un-Favourite</a> when he plays the French Open, with many people, the French crowds included, deriding him for being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a> there.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, his countryman David Ferrer has become more well-known for the alleged lack of respect he gets from tennis pundits and fans than anything about his actual gameplay. The Indian Wells tournament organizers even <em>forgot to put his opening round match on the schedule</em> once — and this was when he was the fifth-best player in the world!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NovakDjokovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NovakDjokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> suffers from this trope to an extent too. Despite his massive achievements and long stints at No. 1, his history/status as the player who's beaten longtime legends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer">Roger Federer</a> and Rafael Nadal the most times means that he's often not the crowd favorite in his major matches. When he beat Federer in the 2015 US Open final, many reports on that match observed that the crowd was so pro-Federer that they were loudly cheering for Djokovic's mistakes despite Djokovic being the No. 1-ranked player who was in the midst of having one of the best-ever tennis seasons at that time.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieGleason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieGleason">Jackie Gleason</a> had <em>lots</em> of fans, but he was snubbed every year at the Emmy Awards. Supposedly, his friend and co-star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArtCarney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArtCarney">Art Carney</a> (who won six Emmys in his career) was upset that Gleason had never won the award, and locked up all of his statuettes whenever Gleason visited his house.
</li><li> Jobs that are in the public sector (retail, police, teachers, etc.) rarely get thanks for the hard work they do for the people they serve. Many war veterans that returned home alive and well can also get the same treatment from their fellow countrymen.
</li><li> The discovery that the Earth orbits the sun has been attributed to Copernicus for many centuries, at least among laymen. In truth, the idea was conceived <em>and partially proven</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink">almost two thousand years earlier</a> by Aristarchus of Samos, whose texts were studied by Copernicus. Have you ever heard of him?
</li><li> Although <em>some</em> factions of the Norwegian resistance movement got their due after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, several others did not. Thus, the communist resistance, who had fought the German occupation with a fervor like any others, ended up under surveillance, and their leaders even got arrested (after 1950). The Norwegian "war sailors" got it even worse. The Navy men had suffered heavy losses in the convoy business, constantly being shelled by German submarines and planes, securing a life line to the British Isles. The Norwegian flotilla was almost solely responsible for the shipment of crude oil and petrol to the UK, without which the R.A.F. never would have gotten off ground (with disastrous results). This unit also, under great peril, managed to secure a route for resistance and refugees across the North Sea. Due to some shade agreements with the shipping elite in Norway, the sailors got nothing out of it, no economic compensation whatsoever, and they even had to <em>pay</em> for treatment (many of them lived as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Shell Shocked Veterans</a> the rest of their lives. If any particular group in this country ever invoked this trope time and again, it was the war sailors.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, many ethnic minority units endured horrendous discrimination in spite of their contributions to the war effort. The Senegalese Tirailleurs were often denied the benefits of their white counterparts in the French Army even though they are more likely to be executed by the Nazis; this discrimination led to ugly incidents of French Army soldiers executing Senegalese Tirailleurs who protested about being denied their promised pensions. Likewise, while the US Army's 442nd Infantry Regiment, which is comprised entirely of Japanese-Americans, became one of the most decorated units in the US Army, yet its member were routinely accused of being spies for Imperial Japan and their families were locked up in internment camps.
<ul><li> One particularly famous American example of this was the Tuskegee Airmen, all-black units (both flyers and support troops) trained as combat pilots despite the racist attitudes of the US during the 1940s. The 332nd Fighter Group became both for their combat prowess (they were, ironically, some of the best trained fighter pilots in the Army, due to being shuffled around from one training unit to another before they were finally allowed to go into combat) and for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoseArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoseArt">flashy red-tailed paint jobs</a> the 99th Fighter Squadron used so bomber crews would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">always know who was protecting them.</a> They eventually developed a reputation as unparalleled escort pilots, with wartime propaganda claiming that the black pilots never lost a bomber on an escort mission (this turned out not to be true, but the reputation stuck.) A similar bomber unit was formed, the 477th Bombardment Group, but the war ended before they saw combat.
</li></ul></li><li> Several women's auxiliaries were formed to support the war efforts of different nations during WWII as well. In the US, these units usually served in various roles stateside to free up fighting men for the front lines. Women's Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs, often flew ferrying flights, flying unarmed fighter planes from the US to combat theaters, or piloted transport planes carrying troops and supplies. It wasn't until the 1970s that these women's auxiliaries were granted status as military veterans and allowed to collect veterans' benefits.
