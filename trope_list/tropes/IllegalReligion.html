</div></div><p>Religion is one of the chiefest aspects of a culture, one that is quite deeply-rooted among many. To take away that religion is viewed by many as destructive of the culture in general, and probably the biggest way that people try to do this is to outlaw the religion, banning the worship of the religion's deity or deities and the practices of the religion in general.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The reasons for doing this vary:
</p><ul><li> One culture has taken over another, and in order to facilitate assimilation into the prevailing culture and stamp out rebellion, religion is among the many cultural aspects the other culture may outlaw, usually to force the populace into following the other culture's religion. Sometimes this works in reverse, with the ban on religion being a way to try to halt the encroachment of another culture on the other's way of life.
</li><li> Another religion has taken hold in the land and sees the other religion as competition, often leading to the other religion being declared evil and fit only to be wiped out.
</li><li> The government or ruler doing the banning has a serious hatred for the religion in question and/or sees the religion as a threat to their power. Usually, said government wants the religion gone in favor of its state religion, or in more modern times, complete devotion to the state.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Sometimes, in fantasy settings where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">Gods Need Prayer Badly</a>, this may be an attempt to weaken or outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheGod">kill a god</a> by denying him or her the worship he or she needs.
</li><li> The religion requires or encourages behavior that is unacceptable to the ruling culture. In this case, the rulers may tolerate abstract <em>belief</em> in the religion as long as the objectionable elements are not <em>practiced</em>.
</li><li> Prevalent in more modern or futuristic settings, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmperorScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmperorScientist">Emperor Scientist</a> or similar wants their society to embrace scientific progress and sees religion as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions">trappings of the unenlightened past or what's holding them back</a>. They often view the religious as incapable of scientific thought despite any evidence to the contrary.
</li></ul><p>This usually results in the banned religion being driven underground, as people are naturally resistant to attempts to stop them from practicing their own religion and believing in or worshipping their own gods. As a result, this may be a source of tension between the people and the powers that be that, if left unchecked (or aggravated by other factors), may very well lead to rebellion.

When the District 2 Victors celebrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas">Wintermas</a>, Boudicca offers a thanksgiving prayer to the Capitol and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Snow</a>, and all colloquial references to God are instead replaced with "Snow," including in cursing.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">     Film  </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> During the reign of the Galactic Empire in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> universe, the Jedi were hunted down and driven to near-extinction by Imperial forces, their religion dwindling from universally recognized to often ridiculed as old superstition. Emperor Palpatine and his right hand Darth Vader were members of the evil Sith order, the ancient enemies of the Jedi. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">Rogue One</a></em> shows the Church of the Force also was banned and its holy sites destroyed, because the Empire was afraid of any belief in this. The new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> books also say they banned religion in general (though obviously it was hard to enforce), with atheism promoted instead (including here not just disbelief in gods but also the Force).
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a> film series, Christianity is considered illegal to practice, as One Nation Earth actively hunts down all who do.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromLA">Escape from L.A.</a></em>, the new extreme right wing President who takes over the United States outlaws all religions other than Christianity as well as atheism. It is punishable by death through deportation to the hellish, crime-ridden Los Angeles Penitentiary Island. Taslima, one of the inhabitants, tells Snake that she was an American Muslim before she was shipped off to L.A.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em>: Islam has apparently been outlawed by the Norsefire regime, since Gordon is shot just for possessing a Qu'ran (even when he's not Muslim). Presumably all Muslims have been killed or imprisoned by them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CSATheConfederateStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CSATheConfederateStatesOfAmerica">C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America</a></em> the Christian Reform Act bans any religion not based on Christianity. It's noted that there was much debate before deciding that Catholicism was safe under the act, and that the Jews were nearly thrown out, but Jefferson Davis's dying wish (and reminder that it was a Jew who saved the Confederacy) allowed for a small settlement of Jews on Long Island.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Silence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Silence">Silence</a></em> takes place in feudal Japan where Christianity is outlawed by the Shogunate, and it has to be practiced in secret by those who believe in it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's revealed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> knows about the crypto-Christians as he admits to the main protagonist, but isn't really interested in persecuting them since they are a minority and aren't really represent a threat to the state so long as they are out of sight and abjure their faith in public</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldThroughTheFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldThroughTheFire">Gold Through the Fire</a></em>: Christianity gets portrayed this way in the Soviet Union. However, it wasn't actually outlawed, although persecution and restriction did happen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LovingAnnabelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LovingAnnabelle">Loving Annabelle</a></em>: Annabelle is not permitted to have Buddhist prayer beads, presumably as it's in a Catholic school. It isn't that she's Buddhist herself (they're a memento from her girlfriend), but the effect is the same. She's punished for refusing this with wearing a huge crucifix, but gives in later.

The Tians allow Altans in captured territory to continue to worship their own deities, to avoid the problems that would result from underground worship. (The fact that the Tian and Altan pantheons are almost identical doesn't hurt, either.)
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings">David Eddings</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad">Belgariad</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Malloreon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Malloreon">Malloreon</a></em> series, the Bear Cult, based on a misguided worship of the Alorn's god Belar, has to be periodically suppressed for its fanaticism.
<ul><li> In turn the Bear Cults <em>wants</em> to do this the other Kingdoms of the West, forcing them to worship Belar as opposed to their own gods (or all of them in the case of the very ecumenical Sendars).
</li><li> While the outlawing of the Bear Cult is the banning of a specific form of an accepted religion, a straighter example is the banning of the worship of Torak in all the Alorn Kingdoms. Similarly in Mallorea traditional Karand religion is banned, mostly because it involves the worshipping and summoning of <em>demons</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> universe, Coram Agh Tera, the Cult of the Lionhead Spider, is a forbidden religion in many of the civilized nations due to its practice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a>, and while the persecution is not as intense as it has been in the past, very few places will allow Coram Agh Tera cultists to preach openly. The government of Temeria is particularly keen to suppress the cult within their borders, and membership of the Lionhead Spider cult is a crime akin to murder.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>, both Omnia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em> and Borogravia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em> banned any religion other than the state one (Omnianism and Nugganism, respectively). Borogravia's neighbour and arch-rival Zlobenia banned the Nugganatic religion, which was probably for the best.
</li><li> Downplayed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier">Star Carrier</a> series</em>, where the Terran Confederation's "White Covenant" law means that, while religion isn't banned outright, many of its common practices are. In particular, proselytizing, many missionary activities, and conversion by threat or force are considered violations of basic human rights. This came about after Islamic terrorists nuked several major cities and set off World War III, and understandably doesn't sit well with a lot of religious groups (the Muslims especially, since it bans a core tenet of the faith, to bring the word of Allah to the infidel).

<ul><li> In the backstory, the Emperor outlawed all religion during the formative years of the Imperium (except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">Cult Mechanicus</a>, because the Mechanicum was necessary and their religion was probably deemed "acceptable"). He promoted state-enforced atheism, publicly because religion was a superstition and a hindrance, privately because he hoped to quash Chaos Cults an attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeedsPrayersBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodNeedsPrayersBadly">starve the Chaos Gods to death</a>. Unfortunately, it didn't work due to a research failure on his part: the Chaos gods are fueled not by prayer, but by emotion. A galaxy at war was great for the Chaos Gods in the short term, but they knew they had to do something and banded together to break the Imperium.
</li><li> As a corollary to the above, the Emperor sent his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrulySingleParent">"sons"</a> to unite the galaxy into Imperium. One of them, Lorgar of the Word Bearers, chose to evangelize the cult of the Emperor in spite of his father's decree against religion. After a time, the Emperor publicly and painfully censured Lorgar, who turned to his homeworld's old religion which followed Chaos, and it was enough of a foot in the door for Chaos, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">but that's another story</a>.

Other religions are still ruthlessly suppressed.
</li><li> There are actually countless variations on the cult of the Emperor, as establishing a single version on the million worlds of the Imperium is impossible. Instead, whether or or not a particular cult is heretical or not is basically up to the local governor/Ecclesiarchy, and the Inquisition intervenes if they think they're getting too lax. This has the unfortunate side effect of allowing genestealer cults to flourish under certain circumstances, as unlike Chaos cults, who are dead-set on toppling the Emperor and whose acts are rather obvious, the genestealers are allowed to keep worshiping a bastardized version of the Emperor as a father figure, which then leads to the Tyranid fleets attacking.

<ul><li> There are, however, occasional bans on specific cults and their practices for even non-Chaos gods, although they are predominantly imposed by the Empire's secular authorities: good examples would be cults of Khaine, a particularly dangerous war god to the High Elves, god of murder and assassination to everyone else; cults of Nagash, the Lord of Undeath (even before his ascension to actual godhood, there were a few); and those who worship Ranald, god of luck, in his aspect as the patron of gamblers, swindlers and thieves tend to find their actions curtailed. Those that worship Ranald in his aspect as Handrich, god of merchants and commerce, don't have that problem.
</li><li> In neighbouring Bretonnia, the official position is that only the state religion, venerating the Lady of the Lake, is an actual religion, everything else is peasant superstition to be wiped out when the local lord deigns to notice. However, the majority of peasants worship Shallya, goddess of mercy and healing without interference from their overlords, anyone from outside the kingdom is permitted to worship any non-Chaotic gods as they wish (on the grounds that "foreigners don't know any better"), and the coastal towns and cities worship Manann, god of the seas as a pragmatic defence against storms and tidal waves.

Still, many of those who follow the most malevolent and dangerous of the Princes, like Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and, to a lesser extent Namira, Vaermina, Boethiah, and Hircine (due to how their worship generally involves bringing death and suffering to others), are branded as dangerous cultists (or worse). Only a few of the Daedric Princes are considered inoffensive enough throughout most of Tamriel to be tolerated, such as Azura, Nocturnal, and Meridia.
</li><li> As mentioned, the various Cyrodillic Empires tend to dislike the idea of outlawing religions for theological reasons, as a lingering reaction to the extremism of the Marukhati period  which does not mean it does not outlaw religions, it just does so for political reasons, like connections to anti-Imperial movements (many Meridian cults), being involved with conspiracies to usurp the throne (there was a crackdown on Mehrunes Dagon cults after the Simulacrum), or attacking the legitimacy of the Septim Dynasty (Arcturianism).

<ul><li> The Ancient Greek and Roman world were tolerant of religion so long as it did not contravene the Gods of the State, i.e. official religion.
<ul><li> One of the charges against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socrates</a> at his trial was that he practiced private beliefs against the state religion. This led them to accuse him of impiety, corrupting the youth and subverting the state.
</li><li> The Romans faced one of the greatest struggles during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishRevolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishRevolts">Jewish Revolts</a> not because they saw Judaism as illegal per se, but because their occupation was violating, perhaps unwittingly, Jewish customs and traditions, namely Pompey marching into the Temple's inner sanctum, the "Holy of Holies", that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">Puppet King</a> Herod was unpopular and this sparked a major religious uprising that continued until the Fall of Masada. Judaism would continue to trouble the Romans with further rebellions until Hadrian crushed and scattered the Jews into diaspora and even renamed Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina, forbidding the re-establishment of the Temple. Jews who adjusted to Roman customs, and accepted Roman rule were not proscribed but the main tenets of their religion and its ties to Jerusalem were definitely forbidden.
</li><li> Christianity endured periods of persecution (albeit sometimes exaggerated<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0de3f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0de3f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0de3f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Being fed to lions, plus many gruesome martyrdom stories have no historical evidence for them-much was written once Christianity triumphed.</span>), indifference, and finally active patronage on account to its growth during the "crisis of the third century". Christianity initially faced objections because they refused to acknowledge the Caesar as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a>, and the fact that its hero Jesus was crucified, which to Roman sensibilities marked him as a criminal and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Outlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Outlaw">Outlaw</a> beyond the pale. The Roman elite such as Lucian of Samosata saw Christianity as similar to other Roman and foreign cults which had cropped up across the empire at the time and viewed it with bemused contempt. Eventually, its appeal among Roman lower classes spread and finally it attained official support from the Emperor Constantine, who was claimed to have been led to victory by the Abrahamic God after seeing Christian symbols in a vision. He legalized it, though it wasn't until some fifty years later under Flavius Theodosius Augustus it became the state religion.
</li><li> When Christianity started gaining ground, the old pagan religions suffered declining faithful, proscription, and dereliction of their property. Temples of Jupiter and Mars were used as roadside privies, and subject to vandalism and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage">Monumental Damage</a>. Christians also burnt many books and teachings from the era they now called "pagan". The Emperor Julian the Apostate, raised as a Christian but seeking and identifying with Hellenism, sought to end Christian persecution of pagans and Jews, while limiting its spread. He made efforts to halt the tide, but he died in battle after a brief reign and all his attempts at religious co-existence ended with him. Pagans were actively persecuted, temples and statues were destroyed (except for those preserved by the state and some responsible bishops and priests), and fell into disrepair.
</li></ul></li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoorishSpain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MoorishSpain">Moorish Spain</a> is often noted by scholars for its religious tolerance, this changed when the Almohad Caliphate rose to power, outlawed Christianity and Judaism, and forced its minorities to convert to Islam or face death  something completely unprecedented in the region's history. The Almohads were considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">fundamentalists</a> even by their own contemporaries, with their founder being previously exiled from every city he preached in because he accused others of being "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">insufficiently Islamic</a>". As such, even those who converted were still discriminated against because their rulers felt they weren't sincere enough in their faith (unsurprisingly, since they did it under pressure). It was only after the Almohads declined in power that they abandoned these puritanical doctrines and policies.
</li><li> The Roman Catholic Church actively prohibited heresies and declared crusades against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a> of pagan communities. Although sometimes this policy was pursued independently - for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, who crushed pagans in Saxony  the Church generally condoned or refused to acknowledge this violence. This includes the Wendish Crusade and the notoriously bloody Albigensian Crusade which crushed Catharism, a revival of Manichaeanism that spread from Hungary to Southern France.
<ul><li> Contrary to general belief, the Roman Catholic Church never pursued an official coordinated policy to proscribe and persecute Judaism. Some Popes were quite tolerant and even liberal (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PopeAlexanderVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PopeAlexanderVI">Pope Alexander VI</a>), others were openly antisemitic and limited Jews to ghettoes. Low-level bishops and priests could be openly antisemitic and encourage pogroms during the Black Death and in other eras, while other bishops in Germany and Hungary sheltered and protected Jews during the People's Crusade (the starting point of populist antisemitism in European history). However, kings and queens appealing to the sentiments of their subjects and seeking to expand the control of the local Catholic Church would promote policies of expulsion. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefuLnotes/EdwardTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefuLnotes/EdwardTheFirst">Edward I</a> banned Jews from England, Philip the Fair proscribed their property and expelled them, and other nations followed similar policies.
</li><li> In the history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain">Spain</a>, the Reconquista and the early years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition">The Spanish Inquisition</a> featured mass persecution of Jews and Muslims across Spain, many of whom were forced to convert. Even after conversion, they were labeled New Christians and treated as second-class citizens to distinguish them from Old Christians. There were also accusations that some Jews and Muslims forced into conversion were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HidingBehindReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HidingBehindReligion">Hiding Behind Religion</a> and practicing their old beliefs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion">Beneath Suspicion</a> of Christian piety. Some of these accusations were actually true and would be recognized and celebrated today as an act of resistance on the part of oppressed people preserving their culture from tyranny, but at the time it was a serious slur and led many New Christians to backdate and fake their lineage to fit in. Those who refused to convert became refugees, and many of them, ironically enough, found a home in Rome, welcomed by Pope Alexander VI (who <em>was</em> Spanish), who gave them rights to live without any pressure of conversion.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1bdh0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1bdh0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1bdh0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Pope Alexander VI, being a Borgia and otherwise quite corrupt, would face trouble from his successors who invoked his philanthropy to Jews as a rebuke.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> When Protestantism arrived, the reigning Catholic Church saw it as another heresy rather than a separate religion. However Protestantism attracted the support of kings and lords in Germany, Holland, Sweden and later England. This would lead to the Reformation and later the Wars of Religion.
<ul><li> Protestantism <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">in turn persecuted other minority faiths</a>, <em>and other Protestant sects</em>. Martin Luther was fiercely antisemitic and wrote many pamphlets that were revived by the Nazis, and he also allied with state authorities against Protestant sects that were more egalitarian than he was (namely Thomas Muntzer) and suppressed them.
</li><li> In England, the Anglican Church sponsored by the King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a> would persecute English Catholics and shut down monasteries. Later Protestant English monarchs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OliverCromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> would persecute Irish Catholics and create division by encouraging settlements of Protestant nobility among a largely Catholic peasantry, leading to divisions (initially religious, later national, now ethnic) that persist to the present day. Catholicism was never declared illegal officially, but Catholics in England and Ireland were treated as second-class citizens (albeit better than Jews and other minorities) with restricted civil rights until the 19th Century.
</li><li> The Anglican Church persecuted Protestant dissenters such as Baptists, Quakers and other sects, many of whom settled in America to escape the Church of England. Because dissenting Protestants were such a big part of American society and politics, they disliked an official organized church authority (at the time that is), and this led to consensus for the First Amendment, a policy that forbids any official government position or endorsement of religion, that separates Church and State and also upholds religious liberties. Initially this applied only to the federal government (some states then still had official churches, and prosecuted preachers from minority sects at times for preaching without a licence). By the 1830s, however, these were abolished. Blasphemy laws did not last much longer in the US. Sadly though, some Native American religions and rituals would be banned later. Even now there is much dispute over the right extent of religious freedom, with Congress and courts wrangling over it regularly.
</li><li> Scotland dissolved and banned Catholicism in 1560, though bans on mass were often not enforced. Catholic holdouts still existed in the Highlands region, and provided support for Catholic monarchs later in the Jacobite Risings. Priests were subject to arrest.
</li><li> Of note is Queen Mary I's reign, in which she tried to restore Catholicism in England, and enforce it with the burning of Protestants. The sheer amount of victims (over 300 of them in a five year reign, including tradesmen, women, children, and a <em>pregnant</em> woman), coupled with her marrying Phillip of Spain (which brought fears of the above mentioned Inquisition coming to England), turned the people against her and against Catholicism, and when her half-sister Elizabeth took the throne, one of the first things she did was re-establish the Protestant church. The fears of a Catholic England so scarred the people that they overthrew the next Catholic monarch to come, and to this day Catholics are barred from the line of succession.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> resulted in the first instance of secular persecution of Christianity.
<ul><li> On account of the Catholic Church being the largest landowner in France at a time of economic and political crisis, many French politicians, writers and thinkers instituted comprehensive policies to seize and distribute the land to peasants, middle-class aspirants, and liberal nobles. They also instituted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, demanding that French priests swear loyalty to the French government and abjure their vows to the Pope. A few priests took the Constitutional Oath, like the famous anti-racist and abolitionist Henri Gregoire, but many of France's devout opposed this change and most priests refused to take the vows, playing a major role in unleashing the counter-revolution as the Revolutionary hardliners became enraged at their continued and active defiance, guillotining many of those that refused.
</li><li> It must be noted that the Revolutionaries gave equal rights to all minority religions (Protestants, Jews) and supported the Constitutional Clergy and mainly targeted pre-Revolutionary Catholics. During the Terror, they released a policy of Dechristianization, which led to vandalism (albeit considerably exaggerated) of many churches and cemeteries. The cemeteries had graffiti proclaiming "Death is an eternal sleep", priests and nuns were guillotined, and monasteries were vandalized. The Notre Dame Cathdral saw its altar attacked and replaced with a "Statue of Liberty" (the Roman Goddess Liberty<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2d3dv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2d3dv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2d3dv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which led to its presence in Revolutionary iconography finally resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/StatueOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/StatueOfLiberty">Lady Liberty</a></span>). Some Revolutionaries such as Robespierre opposed Dechristianization and ended it, while Henri Gregoire, the Constitutional clergyman, advocated defending Church property and opposed vandalism.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a> famously remarked that religion is "the opium of the masses".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3kmnu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3kmnu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3kmnu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In context of the text and the time this was not necessarily negative — Marx saw opium as a painkiller as it was seen in that time, and basically relieving suffering. Marx in other articles criticized revolutionaries for advocating that religion is the main source of social problems and hinders progress rather than economic inequality. He pointed out that America was an advanced nation and religious. He felt that religion would decline if socialists relieved the problems that make people turn to religion.</span> Communist revolutionaries invoked this remark and officially promoted atheism among their cadres, education systems and general propaganda, while also persecuting religion and believers to varying degrees.
<ul><li> In Russia, as in France, the ruling Orthodox Church was a powerful presence in administration and society and owned much property. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> suppressed the Orthodox Church, promoted atheism in society and education, and forbade religious education in schools. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> increased the persecution of all religions (even minorities) and the Orthodox Church at first before reviving it during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> under government control to help the war effort.
</li><li> Other left-wing groups took anti-Catholic activities more seriously. Mexico saw the Cristero War during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties">The Roaring '20s</a> where priests were banned and driven underground and religious iconography was often seen as a mark of treachery. Communist Albania went so far as to ban religious practice entirely. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong">Mao Zedong</a> suppressed traditional worship and practices and persecuted Tibetan Buddhism, but later successors driven by the fascination of tourists to Tibet have promoted lamaseries and moderated their stance while making images, texts and addresses of the Dalai Lama taboo. On a lesser note, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar">Spanish Civil War</a> left-wing fighters attacked and killed clergy, burning churches or converting them for secular uses, with much the same grievances as above.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> was notoriously antisemitic and scientific racialist. It outlawed Judaism as a religion and even persecuted ethnic and cultural Jews, or Jews who had converted to Christianity (for sincere and or social careerist reasons).
<ul><li> Hitler and the Nazis were not entirely friends of Christianity either. Hitler was publicly a Christian but the Nazi policy of state control by party meant that they clamped down on religious instructions and interfered in doctrines of the Church. Some Catholics and Protestants supported the Nazis but those who didn't could face jail time and execution or deportation to concentration camps. Jehovah's Witnesses were persecuted as a group over their refusal to swear loyalty oaths or serve in the military (both forbidden by Witness beliefs) with some being executed and many imprisoned in concentration camps. "YHVH" was even ordered erased wherever it was displayed in churches, as this was the "Jewish" name of God. In one instance, local Nazi officials ordered even crosses removed from churches, but this was a step too far as you might except. After protests, the edict was withdrawn. The Nazis also had plans to turn Jesus into an Aryan figure if they couldn't simply abolish Christianity and replace it with their own religion. For the moment, the Nazis backed a so-called "Positive Christianity" and "German Christian" movement which aligned with their ideology. Their supporters managed to take control of the Lutheran Church in Germany. The Confessing Church, made up of dissident Protestants that refused to join, was driven underground, with members subjected to the treatment stated above. Hitler initially signed a concordat with the Catholic Church on coming to power, but frequently broke its terms and by the late 1930s Catholics were actively being persecuted (even if they were not openly dissident). The Catholic bishops protest at the Aktion T4 program (exterminating disabled and mentally ill patients) which managed to stop it temporarily, especially angered Hitler, and he swore to "settle with them" after the war ended. Hitler's private beliefs are still not entirely clear, though he did denounce Christianity and of course Judaism. Even in private though he also denounced atheism, saying it was inhuman and claimed to believe in God (though perhaps of a deist or pantheist variety).
</li><li> The Nazis outlawed atheist and freethought groups as well as Freemasonry in Germany in 1933. In one instance, the headquarters of the German Freethinkers League wound up being used by the churches of Berlin as a bureau to convert people and give religious advice. In a lesser example, the SS loyalty oath denounced atheists, while banning them from joining. Freemasons were also deported and executed in concentration camps alongside Jews and Gypsies. In practice though regarding the SS, those terms had socialist connotations in Nazi Germany. Any non-socialist who was not Catholic or Protestant (and Muslim in certain cases), <a class="urllink" href="http://apjjf.org/-Hans-Joachim-Bieber/4902/article.pdf">including some who might have been atheists<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> simply identified as "God believer", (Gottgläubig) who in fact made up a <a class="urllink" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SHl7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=religion+nazi+ss+protestant+catholic">disproportionately large percentage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the SS (25% by 1938) compared to the German population at large, where all but <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany">1-6% belonged<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to Protestant or Catholic Churches officially. German SS units <a class="urllink" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QYKuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=chaplains+waffen+ss&amp;hl=pt-BR">were not even assigned chaplains<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in contrast to regular German Army practices. Open atheism was associated with Bolshevism and communism generally, the ideology that was the Nazis' chief enemy. All open atheists were therefore persecuted by association with this.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny">Independent State of Croatia</a> (which was just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">Axis puppet regime despite the name</a>), Eastern Orthodoxy was outlawed alongside Judaism because it was the Serbs' favored religion, while the State only recognized Roman Catholicism and Sunni Islam as "brother religions that kept the blood of Croats true". As such, Serbs faced persecution from both Catholic and Muslim fascists via ethnic cleansing, deportation and forced conversions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> banned Christianity in 1587, ordering all Christian missionaries to leave Japan.
<ul><li> He saw the religion as a threat to his dream of unifying Japan, and politically, this was done to reduce the influence of the Christian daimyo of Kyushu. A decade later in 1597, Hideyoshi had twenty-six Christians, known today as the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-six_Martyrs_of_Japan">Twenty-Six Martyrs of Japan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, crucified as an example to native Japanese seeking to convert to the religion. The banning of Christianity went even further after the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimabara_Rebellion">Shimabara Rebellion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and (even after Christianity was again made legal in 1871 with the reopening of the country) there are still some "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakure_Kirishitan">hidden Christians<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" (<em>kakure Kirishitan</em>) who descend from the survivors of the persecution.
</li><li> This is in contrast to his predecessor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a>, who kept the Christians around (mainly because he wanted their guns) but had all but declared war on certain Buddhist sects (who, unlike the Christians, were a political threat to him). This ended up being his undoing.
</li><li> Later historians note that the Japanese policy was a result of the advice given to them by Protestant Dutch traders. They pointed out that the Catholic Church had promoted colonialist oppression in South America among native peoples and destroyed the Mayan and Aztec ruling class. The Japanese shogunate, fearful of Christian expansion and persecution, felt he had to take a preemptive strike and force Christians to apostasize. Notably, while Catholic Christianity was banned from Japan during its period of isolation, Dutch traders and Protestant merchantmen were welcome at the port of Nagasaki (originally a Catholic majority port and seat), so long as they toed the fumie<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4xbpf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4xbpf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4xbpf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A small wooden icon of Jesus which the authorities used to force Catholics to apostasize. The Protestants, being less ritualistic, did not see the fumie as a Christian icon and did not feel they were abjuring their faith.</span> and stayed within limits. This continued until the end of isolation.
</li><li> Hideyoshi also had problems with certain Buddhists. The Ikko-Ikki (militant Buddhist) monks were mortal enemies (and a major thorn in the side) of his ally Nobunaga (who went so far as to destroy their Nagashima fortress, killing everyone inside and burning Ishiyama Hongan-ji to the ground but sparing many of the defenders' lives) and therefore certainly a major stumbling block on the road to a unified Japan. Ironic that Hideyoshi and Tokugawa would clamp down on Christianity when Nobunaga's own brother Nagamasu was Catholic. In another irony, the Ikko-Ikki then joined with Hideyoshi in 1580.
</li></ul></li><li> Missouri Executive Order 44 of 1838 stated that all Mormons in Missouri "must be exterminated or driven from the state," essentially outlawing Mormonism within. Several massacres of Mormons took place, with the rest fleeing. It wasn't officially rescinded until 1976. The federal government later also came into conflict with the LDS Church, mostly over polygamy, from open combat in the Utah War to later legal prosecutions. It culminated with the church itself being dissolved and its property seized. At last, prompted by this, Mormon doctrine was revised to forbid polygamy (although unofficially the practice continued for some time, and splinter sects rejected the change entirely).
</li><li> In the <em>Tanakh</em> (Old Testament to Christian readers), worship of anything other than the one and only God was illegal and punishable by death according to many laws and decrees by the prophets and is listed as the First Commandment ("Thou shalt have no other gods before me."). But for much of Israel's history, many rulers not only allowed worship of other things, but actively facilitated it. They were okay with magi (Persian Zoroastrian priests) even in periods where they otherwise had officially banned all other forms of worship too, since Cyrus The Great was viewed as God's servant foretold by Isaiah after he freed the Israelites enslaved by the Babylonians, allowing them to return home. Today, Israel officially allows any religion to be practiced, but accounts from self-identified "pagans" claim they would be cut to pieces if they ever publicly admitted to worshiping someone like Anat or Thor.
</li><li> In around the 5th century CE, the Sassanid Persian Empire was intolerant of any religion other than Zoroastrianism, enforcing a ban on them and attempting to force its Christian Armenian subjects to convert. The ensuing rebellion, led by Vartan Mamikonian, ended in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> for the Persians and eventually led to Persia becoming more lenient due to their needing Armenia's cooperation in dealing with the invading Huns. Modern Armenians credit Vartan's revolt with saving Armenia's religious identity.
</li><li> Zoroastrianism and paganism itself were banned in the Armenian Kingdom in the 4th century, until the kingdom got taken over and partitioned by Persia and Rome. Conversion to Christianity still didn't happen overnight, but the temples to the various Armenian gods were destroyed soon after the king converted. This was the common path conversion to Christianity took in many kingdoms.
</li><li> While Singapore is a secular society and tolerates other religions, the Jehovah's Witnesses are banned within the city state (mainly because Singapore has a mandatory military draft, and Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to serve in any military or swear loyalty to any person or thing other than God). Similarly, the Unification Church is banned in Singapore because the government sees the church as a cult.
</li><li> Many countries with a Muslim majority forbid conversion to another religion from Islam, or blasphemy. Prosecution of atheists, Christians, and minority religious adherents for alleged violations of these laws occurs in many parts of the Muslim world, along with extra-legal attacks. Some of these countries also persecute people who follow the "wrong" kind of Islam. The most extreme is Saudi Arabia, which forbids anything but Wahhabist Sunni Islam in the kingdom. Christians are persecuted in the country, with churches, missionaries, and Bibles all illegal. Atheism is also forbidden and declared a form of terrorism.
</li><li> Islam is illegal in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/738462/Slovakia-law-Islam-ban-registered-religion-Eu-migrant-quota-Muslim-sentiment">Slovakia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Contrary to popular belief, religion in general <em>isn't</em> outlawed in current-day China. However, it is against the law for a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to follow a religion, presumably meaning you can't have a government job if you're religious. Moreover, some sects (like the Falun Gong, independent Christians, and Tibetan Buddhists loyal to the Dalai Lama) are banned/persecuted. Religion generally was suppressed in the early period under Mao, especially during the Cultural Revolution.
