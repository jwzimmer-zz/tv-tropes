<ul><li> In typical <em>40K</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">fashion</a>, this story has gone <strong>far</strong> beyond a Last Stand, with many Krieg insisting Terranis still "holds" after more than a century surrounded by Warp storms <em>and</em> being engulfed by a Tyranid splinter fleet, and the planet has taken on a religious reverence not just to them, to the extent that it's regarded as part of the afterlife.
<div class="indent"><em>Contact was lost before the invasion began, and nearly everyone assumes that the place was lost when the xenos hit it. I mean, one planet against an entire splinter fleet. I asked the next Krieg soldier I saw about this, why they believed that a planet that was by all reasoning most likely a dead rock, was their place of salvation and reward. The Krieger soldier just saluted and said the first words I've ever heard a Krieger speak: "Terranis holds."</em>
</div></li><li> Upped to insanity in a later fanfiction, where it turns out that Terranis did hold out until warpstorms ended, but due to the fact that the legend about it was demoralizing other regiments it was intentionally put into the warp by an inquisitor, so that it would only stay as a sort-of paradise to Kriegers. It seems that the world is dead and overrun with demons? No. Why? Because orks were so terrified by the legend that Kriegers reincarnate until they earn the honour of joining others in Terranis, that this actually starts happening. And because of this Terranis is locked in an eternal last stand in the warp, constantly reinforced by new Kriegers who earned their right to go there.
<div class="indent"><em>Terranis will hold. Always.</em>

The story generally discredits the concept, noting that most of the time the choice to fight in a Last Stand rather than accept surrender is only a needless waste of lives.
<ul><li> In a footnote, Cloud Kicker notes that this has historically resulted in a great deal of ponies dying needlessly over matters of pride, and that as a survivor of a near last stand herself she sees little appeal in the concept. A short while later in the story proper, Shadow concedes that its easy to speak of dying gloriously when youre not the one whos actually going to have to die.
</li><li> In the end, after the Siege of Canterlot is broken, Steel Striker and his army choose to fight and die at the Maresidian Fields, caught between two royalist armies, knowing that the cause they fought for is already lost and preferring a honorable death to a humiliating peace through surrender. Steel even briefly wonders if there will be any stories about the last stand of the last ponies not to answer to immortal rulers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They don't get the chance.

</li><li> In the last true battle of the war, the remnants of the rebels engage the loyalist army in a last huge, hopeless charge once the latter reaches Cloudsdale, rather than face the humiliation of defeat. The last surviving rebel leader, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rightly Doo</span>, chooses to dress as a common soldier and die alongside his army rather than submit to the ignominy of captivity. This is later decried as a useless sacrifice of hundreds lives for the sake of maintaining national and personal pride, as the loyalists would have readily accepted a surrender.

Some result in the deaths of protagonists. The novel <em>Dabog</em> is particularly notable as it involves a group of volunteers jacking into the titular planet's missile defense network instead of boarding evacuation ships in order to buy time for said ships to run the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Earth Alliance</a> blockade, knowing that their eventual fate is to be nuked by the angry admiral whose attempts to take the planet failed. Given that the colonists are the ones who eventually win the drawn out war, the memory of Dabog (which even centuries later remains uninhabitable) and those who fell defending it is still strong. In the novel <em>Black Moon</em>, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsCold">frozen</a> defenders of Dabog is revived and arrives to a battle between two Confederate fleets.

After centuries of fleeing in modified asteroids, the Lethanta have settled on a world they called Nem Ma'ak Bratuna ("the last stand" in their language). At the same time as the <em>Enteprirse</em>, the Kreen arrive in a large sublight fleet having been following their enemies and building up their forces for a final strike. However, the Lethanta have prepared a doomsday device that will cause a nova-level event wiping out everything in the system (they have previously sent a group of their people away in those same asteroids).

<ul><li> Indeed, even the aliens acknowledge this: one major difference between Yeerks and humans is that Yeerks will give up if they know they're going to lose, while humans won't. Some, like the Yeerk that controlled Jake or Visser Three, think this is basically pointless, but Visser One was smart enough to realize this would make conquering humans a harder task to accomplish.
</li><li> Stated almost flat-out by one of Visser One's hosts:

This also sparks an epiphany as to which of his dual identities is the true him; because Admiral Naismith strove for victory, but Lord Vorkosigan could not surrender, so in the end Lord Vorkosigan was the persona he chose.

He elects to stay behind and hold off the Russians for as long as it takes for the boy soldiers, inclusing Sajer, to get to safety. Sajer recollects getting to safety and realising the fighting behind them goes on for a long time until - the shooting abruptly ends.

<ul><li> The fan-beloved Brunnen-G Fight Song was traditionally sung by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Brunen-G</a> on just such occasions: a hopeless battle which is being fought anyway because it's better to go out fighting than to give in to despair.

The cast's future selves attack them (knowing they would also die) because they refuse to live as the current cast do, because they have become corrupt and seduced by power. They kill three of the characters, leaving only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rimmer, the most cowardly and weasely one of the lot. He immediately sets off to destroy the time drive that allowed them to time travel and become corrupt in the first place, before Starbug is blown up in a last ditch move. Series 7 claims that it was the act of Starbug blowing up that meant the future selves couldn't attack them as they'd not exist. However, some people believe Rimmer was successful, so he can be a hero.</span>

</li><li> Subverted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusVengeance">Spartacus: Vengeance</a></em>: After fighting their way through a forest Spartacus, Mira, Naevia, and Nasir finally make it to Mount Vesuvius, only to hear an army approach them from behind. Nasir is too wounded to fight and Naevia is too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">traumatized</a>, so Spartacus tells Mira to take them and run. She refuses to abandon him, and the two prepare to make their final stand, only for the approaching forces to be revealed to be their own.
<ul><li> Later played straight in the finale of <em>War of the Damned</em>, with Spartacus and the remaining warriors making a final stand against the Roman army, even though they know they have little chance of winning, to give the non-combatants in their ranks a chance to escape over the mountains.

</li></ul></li><li> Both the classic and revived series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> often features variations on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege">The Siege</a> plot, leading to numerous examples of these moments occurring when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> characters end up performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. The Doctor and his companions can also attempt to perform these on occasion, although they (usually) tend to be averted.
<ul><li> During "The Parting of the Ways", Jack and the rest of Satellite 5 attempt a futile last stand to buy the Ninth Doctor time to complete a weapon that will wipe out the Daleks. Jack only survives after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Bad Wolf!Rose</a> brings him back to life.
</li><li> "The Name of the Doctor" reveals that the Doctor would ultimately die performing one at Trenzalore against countless armies. This nearly comes to pass in "The Time of the Doctor" when the Eleventh Doctor maintains the Siege of Trenzalore for <em>centuries</em> until he starts dying from extreme old age, revealing that he's lost the ability to regenerate because this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfContinues">his final body</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This fate is only narrowly averted by the Time Lords, who grant him a new regeneration cycle for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rewrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rewrite">saving</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Gallifrey</a> in "The Day of the Doctor"</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Near the end of Day Four of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em>: "Children of Earth", we're led to believe that this will happen. Then the trope is horribly, horribly subverted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>'s backstory has The Battle of the Line, the last stand of humanity against the Minbari in the hope of getting as many refugees off Earth and into neutral territory as possible before the Minbari <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">glassed the planet</a>. Humanity suffered 90% casualties while inflicting minimal losses and were about to break when the Minbari, mysteriously, withdrew and sued for peace. Why they did it is a recurring mystery for the series' first season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceAboveAndBeyond">Space: Above and Beyond</a></em> was all about this trope: humanity banding together against the evil "chigs". In the pilot, the Secretary-General of the United Nations makes a very Churchillian speech about "the coming storm", then quotes Churchill directly (the Battle of Britain "Never has so much been owed by so many to so few" speech) after the Wildcards' first major victory.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StargateAtlantisS01E07PoisoningTheWell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StargateAtlantisS01E07PoisoningTheWell">Poisoning the Well</a>," subverts this when the SG team helps the Hoffans develop a treatment to make them unpalatable to the Wraith. When it is discovered that not only does also kill Wraith who attempt to feed, but also kills 50% of those treated, the SG team are horrified to find that the Hoffans consider that acceptable even if the Wraith would likely strike against them as a threat. When the SG team leave in disgust, they mention it is reminiscent of the Churchillian spirit of victory at any price, but they are forced to disagree.

<ul><li> The Japanese fleet in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VictoryInThePacific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VictoryInThePacific">Victory In The Pacific</a> is usually reduced to making one of these at the end of the game, due to their lack of reinforcements.
</li><li> One of the standard scenarios in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>. 3rd edition actually had maps and paper counters for a scenario called "Fornerond's Last Stand," in which a High Elf force had been ambushed by greenskins.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerTheEndTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerTheEndTimes">Warhammer: The End Times</a></em> is this for basically all the good factions and characters on a global scale as Chaos and the Skaven join forces to destroy the world. It's so blatant that whole factions like Bretonnia are wiped out <em>offscreen</em>. Which leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar">Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>'s setting gives everyone ample opportunities to die heroically, both on and off the tabletop. A 4th Edition scenario, typically the last mission in a campaign, revolved around one side's Last Stand; the defenders won if they had any surviving models at the end of the game, meaning they held out long enough to let their comrades escape, or that they killed enough of the enemy to have their names forever etched into their opponent's minds.
<ul><li> One famous example from the fluff is the Battle of Macragge, in which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ultramarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ultramarines">Ultramarines</a>' homeworld found itself facing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Tyranids</a> of Hive Fleet Behemoth. The Ultramarines' 1st Company, comprised of the best warriors in the chapter, made their stand in a polar fortress. When reinforcements finally arrived, they had to clear the Tyranid corpses with flamethrowers, and eventually found the bodies of their battle-brothers in the heart of the fortress, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses">back-to-back</a> and surrounded by walls of alien dead.
<ul><li> The latest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marines</a> codex mentions that many chapters' histories feature such heroic last stands, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">many of which were probably unnecessary</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The rest of the truly famous examples all seem to revolve around Sisters of Battle for some reason - The Bloodtide, Sanctuary 101, Hive Tempestus, Shield of Baal...
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationShips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationShips">Craftworld</a> Iyanden were prepared to make one against Hive Fleet Kraken, but were saved by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">timely arrival</a> of the exiled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Prince Yriel</a>. It was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>, however - four-fifths of the Craftworld's population was dead, Prince Yriel doomed himself by taking up the cursed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath">Spear of Twilight</a>, and Iyanden was forced to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">spirit stones</a> of the dead to field armies of Wraithguard to supplement their forces. To quote Yriel, "We may have won the battle, but our ancestors have lost their souls."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Imperial Guard</a> are particularly good at this. General Sturmm of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em> fame summed up a Guardsman's duty as "We die standing."
</li><li> The Necrons actively avoid this, preferring to teleport away without a trace rather than lose a battle. In earlier editions this was even the army's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> - once it had been reduced to a certain percentage of its starting models, the rest would phase out, giving the opponent the victory.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Tau</a> don't believe in Last Stands - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">unlike most of the other races</a>, Tau military dogma is highly mobile and considers the amount of territory controlled in a conflict to be meaningless compared to the armies that fight on it. Soldiers lost holding a position are therefore throwing their lives away for no reason, and a Tau commander who would commit himself to a Last Stand is incompetent rather than courageous.
</li><li> In the ominously-named "Fall of Cadia", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire Cadian 8th Regiment, along with their commander, Lord-Castellan Ursakar Creed. The planet broke before the Guard did.</span>
</li><li> Basically the entire setting represents a massive, galaxy spanning last stand by the forces of good (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">relatively speaking</a>) against the forces of evil, that has been going on for the last ten thousand years.

It has a lot of interesting effects, as it represents, effectively, the <em>entire planet's</em> Last Stand against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">The Legions of Hell</a>.
<ul><li> Reappears in the Dark Ascension set as the Fateful Hour mechanic, granting certain spells and creatures special bonuses if the user's life total is at 5 or lower. Many of the cards with the mechanic have flavor to this effect.

It boosts your HP for 15 seconds, but when it wears off, you lose all of the HP it gave you, meaning if you're not healed, you're at 1 HP and the next hit is fatal.

</li><li> The Calling is a longstanding tradition for Senior Grey Wardens, where they embark into the Deep Roads, with the intention of taking down as many Darkspawn as they can before they are finally slain.

What really makes it fit the trope is another Captain skill, "In Harm's Way" that redirects incoming damage from the rest of the party <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">onto the Captain</a>.

<ul><li> <em>Lord of the Rings Online</em> has a few missions where the player temporarily takes control of a character in an encounter from the books. Several of these are Heroic Last Stands where the win condition is not to actually defeat the enemies, or even to survive, but simply to do as well as the character canonically did (for example, holding off the enemies long enough to allow another character to escape or finish a task). Examples include the Chamber of Mazarbul in Moria and the Falls of Rauros.

Their logic goes that you can only gain honor in battle by winning, and if you're losing your best option is to cut and run in an attempt to come back another day. If you commit yourself to a last stand not only do you prevent yourself from erasing the stain on your honor later, you're also making the opponent gain less honor from his victory by lessening it at the cost of your own life.

The German siege of Zaragoza starts in March 28, 1941. They send their best Wehrmacht and SS troops into the city, and they are fighting soldiers, militias and civilians that don't want to leave the city (a "ragtag force of Spanish and British regular troops, militiamen, and simple civilians", literally). The German estimation is that it'll take 10 days to take the city. It takes them that much (April 7th) to surround the city completely, pitting 50,000 Allied soldiers and militias against 200,000 German soldiers. It takes them <em>45 days</em> (May 12th) just to take the northern half of the city. Zaragoza doesn't surrender until <em>June 3rd</em>. The result? A good chunk of the German army invading Spain has been held up in Zaragoza for more than two months, the Germans have lost a boatload of tanks and they got 100,000 casualties. The Allies have just 50,000 casualties, mostly Spanish, plus some planes that were trying to drop supplies to keep the siege going.

<ul><li> Special mention goes to #1, Thomas A. Baker, for he was the embodiment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanStillFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanStillFight">I Can Still Fight!</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObiWanMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObiWanMoment">Obi-Wan Moment</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShallNotPass">You Shall Not Pass!</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a>, and <strong>especially</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooCoolToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooCoolToLive">Too Cool to Live</a>. His battalion was severely overpowered by the Japanese, so they began to retreat. Baker was mortally wounded and his guns destroyed, and his comrades began to carry him with the group; however, he refused, and instead wanted to hold off the advancing enemy with whatever shred of life he had left. The group agreed, and gave him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns">Colt M1911 pistol</a> and propped his dying body against a tree trunk. When the Americans regrouped and captured the spot later on, they found Baker's body, with eight bullets fired, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">eight Japanese soldiers lying dead in front of him</a>. He was given a Medal of Honor for his heroic efforts on the brink of death.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20434_5-people-who-took-revenge-to-whole-new-level.html">more recent article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s number 4 slot, Benjamin L. Saloman surpassed even that. While stationed as a field surgeon in Saipan<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3iq64');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3iq64" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3iq64');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Coincidentally the same island that Baker died taking</span>, the impromptu hospital was invaded by Japanese troops, killing some of the wounded he'd just saved. After killing the 4 who'd entered the tent, he provided covering fire for the wounded to evacuate - when they returned later, they found him dead with <em>70 bullets</em> in his body, and 100 Japanese soldiers dead in front of him. Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">this also earned him a post-humous Medal of Honor</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1941-1942 Philippine campaign, specifically the battles of Bataan and Corregidor. Although the Filipino-American defenders gave up in the end (which in turn led to the infamous Bataan Death March), the tenacious defense of Bataan and Corregidor slowed the Japanese advance towards the South Pacific and into Australia, which was further slowed at the Battle of Kokoda Track and finally stopped at the Battle of the Coral Sea.
</li><li> Battle of Thermopylae. Note that Spartan law forbade them to retreat.
<div class="indent"><em>"Go tell the Spartans, passer-by, that here, by Spartan law, we lie."</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>Simonides</strong>, epitaph for the Spartan dead at the Battle of Thermopylae
</div></div><ul><li> The Spartans were bound by their law and honor to stay and fight, but the contingent from Thespiae, who lacked the strict, lifelong military training of the Spartans and had no particular reason to stay, also decided to stand and fight with them as they covered the rest of the Greek army's retreat.
</li></ul></li><li> The Theban Sacred Band (a homosexual warrior fraternity) at the Battle of Chaeronea did <em>even better</em> then the Spartans and Thespiae at Thermopylae. Not "just" guarding a mountain pass they stood in the open field and thumbed their collective noses at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> himself. Unlike the Spartans however, their cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">died</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatASenselessWasteOfHumanLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatASenselessWasteOfHumanLife">with them.</a>
</li><li> Averted with the siege of Masada, where the Judean Zealots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">killed each other rather than surrender.</a> When the Romans finally stormed the fortress, they found every single person dead, including many of them who hadn't wanted to die, <em>including the women and children</em>.
<ul><li> There were seven survivors, all women and children, who had managed to hide. The Romans pardoned them.
</li><li> Masada is also a pilgrimage place for the Israeli soldiers, and their oath states "Masada will not fall again".
</li><li> Sadly, not as heroic as they may seem. As they killed each other rather than themselves, it's very likely that the women and children didn't have a choice in the matter.

</li></ul></li><li> In the months following the end of the Civil War, the US government resumed its focus on westward expansion, ordering the Army to establish forts along the Bozeman Trail. Fearing encroachment, Sioux Chief Red Cloud formed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">tenuous alliance</a> with the Arapaho and Northern Cheyenne to resist this move, kicking off Red Cloud's War. On December 21st, 1866 a large war party led by Oglala war chief Man Afraid of His Horses (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">who was actually a serious badass</a>) and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungFutureFamousPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungFutureFamousPeople">young protege Crazy Horse</a> attacked a woodcutting party to draw out the defenders of Fort Phil Kearny. Captain William Fetterman took the bait and led 81 cavalry and mounted infantry (most of whom were brand-new recruits with only the most rudimentary training; some hadnt even fired their weapons yet) to respond. One of the only experienced Soldiers was Private Adolf Metzger, a German immigrant and Civil War combat veteran who was assigned as bugler. A notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a>, Fetterman ignored orders not to cross Lodge Trail Ridge and led his force out of range of the forts artillery, and straight into an ambush by over 1,000 warriors. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> was over in less than twenty minutes, and a patrol from the fort that evening found all 81 men dead (in exchange for about a dozen Indian casualties). 80 of them had been stripped naked, scalped, gruesomely mutilated, and left face-down, but Adolf Metzgers body was untouched apart from the wounds that killed killed him, and was not only still in his uniform, but left face-up and covered in a buffalo skin, with his bent and blood-covered bugle placed on his chest. According to Lakota accounts of the battle, the untrained US soldiers quickly panicked and lost all unit cohesion. Fetterman failed to direct his men to any effect, and is said by some to have killed himself. Metzger tried in vain to rally the new recruits into something resembling a cohesive defense, but was soon the last white man left alive. He fired his pistol until it ran dry, and then fought several warriors in close combat, swinging his bugle as a bludgeon, killing at least one of his attackers with it before being fatally wounded himself. Man Afraid of His Horses witnessed Metzger's bravery and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">ordered that he be honored in death</a>, exempting his body from mutilation and, according to Lakota custom, sending him to the afterlife as a hero. When the Oglala warriors celebrated their victory the following night, Crazy Horse himself sang a death song in honor of Private Metzger.
</li><li> The famous quote from Napoleon's Imperial Guard ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">the Old Guard dies but does not surrender</a>") at their last stand at the Battle of Waterloo. However, the quote is a complete fabrication - the quote actually given was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">"Merde!"</a> - and the survivors surrendered anyway.
<ul><li> More like they did not surrender as a body, but not long afterwards joined the general rout and were captured individually. What was said, is a matter of dispute. Count Cambronne, who is supposed to have uttered both versions, steadfastly denied he said the first one, which is hardly surprising given that he did not die but did surrender to colonel Hew Halkett of the 3rd Hanoverian (militia) brigade. But he did not confirm or deny the one-word alternative either.

However, the wall is sealed up behind them, allowing no return, and the defenders are invariably annihilated.
</li><li> A semi-aversion: the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorke%27s_Drift">battle of Rorke's drift,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where 150 <em>British</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4es3t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4es3t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4es3t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The 2nd/24th didn't become the South Wales Borderers until two years later, and in 1879 mainly recruited from rural England and Ireland regardless of what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zulu">Zulu</a> may say.</span> soldiers held off a force of 4,000 Zulus through proper use of fortifications and sheer tenacity. The soldiers inflicted enough casualties on the Zulu warriors to convince them that taking the outpost was unnecessarily costly, and most of the defenders escaped with their lives.
<ul><li> Speaking of the Anglo-Zulu War, a Zulu account from the British defeat at Isandlwana tells the story of a big Irish soldier of the 24th who alone stood guard over Lord Chelmsford's tent and Union flag. He kept them back with his bayonet until he was finally overwhelmed by several Zulu warriors.
</li><li> France has its own last stand from the Zulu War, in the form of Louis-Napoléon, only son and heir to then-Emperor Napoleon III. Louis-Napoléon, eager for action, tagged along with the British army and was ambushed while out on patrol by some 40 Zulus. After his horse ran off (trampling his right arm in the process), Louis-Napoléon was cornered and went down fighting with first his pistol, and then with a spear he pulled from his own leg.

Even handicapped by bad planning, bad intel and severe weapons shortages, the <em>Armia Krajowa</em> (Home Army) of occupied Poland held off the <em>Waffen-SS</em> for 63 days...and forced the Germans to treat them as POWs, not "bandits" according to the Geneva Conventions. As they marched out to surrender, many Germans <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">saluted</a></em>.
<ul><li> Although, they never intended to hold out indefinitely. They expected the Red Army (which was approaching at a blistering pace) to relieve them, but apparently didn't understand that the Red Army's latest offensive had neither planned to nor was capable of maintaining a bridgehead over the Vistula so close to Warsaw, a then-improvised but strongly-held lynchpin of the Germans' defensive line there. The Poles had already rebelled when the mobile force closest to Warsaw (as little as 10km, apparently) had to halt for fear of a German counter-attack while they were still nearly out of ammunition and fuel and their men were fainting with hunger and exhaustion. While it Red Army <em>might</em> have executed an improvised offensive within the 60 days of uprising <em>and</em> taken Warsaw in the face of fierce German resistance and counter-attacks, they wouldn't have had the numbers or ammunition for it to be anything but an act of suicide.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note53d6f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note53d6f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note53d6f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Especially given the frantic preparations for the upcoming Iassy-Kishinev offensive against Rumania and the need to exert pressure on Army Group North in the Baltic to keep it from escaping to Germany by sea</span> Thus, the uprising of <em>Armia Krajowa</em>, although valorous, achieved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">much, ''much'' less than it potentially could</a>.
<ul><li> The Soviets were over 10 kilometers from the city center. The Germans who were on the frontlines had been soldiers from the Eastern Front, and been given a hammering the whole time they were retreating. Even if the Red Army couldn't send troops in, they could have at least been more giving in sending the resistance air support and supplies. However, Stalin was not interested in Poland having it's old government back at all. The fact he directly ordered the Red Army to halt before Warsaw after being informed of the plans for the Uprising tells you exactly what he wanted in the long run. Declassified Soviet documents actually show Stalin ordered the Red Army to prevent outside help from getting to the Uprising.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Then there's the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wizna">Battle of Wizna<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Outnumbered over 58:1, with no tanks or air support, in only half-completed fortifications and horribly outgunned, the Polish commander "swore that he would not leave his post alive". And the Polish forces proceeded to inflict remarkably severe casualties upon the Nazis - before, of course, ultimately being annihilated.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epeQwq-aYV0:">Sabaton wrote a song about the battle. Though the song seems to imply the Polish Soldiers survived.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, the last surviving 40 of the 720 Polish soldiers surrendered after being directly ordered by their commanding officer to do so. The commander chose to kill himself rather than surrender his position.
</li></ul></li><li> The Polish held the Germans for three days, September 7-10. Yes, outnumbered that much, they brought Blitzkrieg to a halt for nearly half a week. And they would have held longer, finally surrendering their last bunkers <em>only when they ran out of ammunition.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> The Battle of Camerone in which 65 officers and men of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfLostSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfLostSouls">the French Foreign Legion</a> held off a Mexican force of approximately 2,000 for ten hours. When first asked to surrender, Capitaine Jean Danjou replied simply with, <em>"We have munitions. We will not surrender."</em> The battle ended with a five-man, zero-ammo bayonet charge against the mexicans, after which the last two men on their feet were finally persuaded to surrender on terms. The nineteen surviving legionaires had their wounds tended and were repatriated along with their arms and the bodies of their fallen comrades. Camerone is commemorated annually by the Foreign Legion to this day.
<dl><dd><div class="indent"><em>"The Legion Dies, it does not Surrender!"</em> — Battle cry of Capitaine Jean Danjou, commander of the Legionnaires.
</div></dd></dl><ul><li> As a consequence of this, to this day, whenever a Mexican soldier/officer encounters a Legionnaire, the Mexican will always salute <em>first</em>, no matter what their ranks are.
</li></ul></li><li> Battle of the Bulge, early days of the battle. As related by Hugh M. Cole in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/7-8/7-8_14.htm">"The Ardennes: The Battle of the Bulge"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: "A small group of [American] stragglers suddenly become tired of what seems to be eternally retreating. Miles back they ceased to be part of an organized combat formation, and recorded history, at that point, lost them. The sound of firing is heard for fifteen minutes, an hour, coming from a patch of woods, a tiny village, the opposite side of a hill. The enemy has been delayed; the enemy resumes the march westward. Weeks later a graves registration team uncovers mute evidence of a last-ditch stand at woods, village, or hill."
<ul><li> For that matter, the defense of Bastogne absolutely <em>should</em> have been one of these for the 101st Airborne Division. Utterly surrounded, so low on ammunition Hollywood producers would laugh at it, sitting in the dead of winter, everyone on both sides considered them as good as dead. General Luttwitz of the German army was so impressed with their tenacity his party offered them (supposedly, and relatively) reasonable terms for surrender, prompting one of the most famous replies in history: "Nuts!" History records that their desperate last stand was averted by Patton's army leading a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment to rescue them. The surviving member of the 101st, to this day, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">deny that they were in any need of rescue.</a>
<ul><li> One WW2 history I read said that troops of General Luttwitz had even less ammo than the 101st so not needing rescues might be true.
</li></ul></li><li> From the German side, the Battle of the Bulge is partially seen as a last stand. For one of their last offensives of the war (with Operation Nordwind in Alsace, Konrad in Budapest, and Spring Awakening at Balaton), Hitler had organized all the panzer forces not needed in Hungary to attack the weakest point of the Western Allies, in the hopes that doing so would cause them to negotiate peace terms. The wider logic was shakier, assuming that the Germans would still be able to hold the Soviets off afterwards despite being outnumbered by 4:1 and outgunned by 10:1. Hitler's very last stand ever would take place against the 1st Belorussian Front and 2nd Ukrainian Front in Berlin.
</li></ul></li><li> Ireland has had a few of these. While taking part in a UN Peacekeeping mission in Congo during the 1960's, an army of Katangese separatists attacked the UN position at <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jadotville">Jadotville<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The Irish force of about 150 were armed with nothing heavier than personal weapons and some WWI-era machine guns. The attackers had 4,000+ troops, mortars, a field gun, and a <em>frakking jet</em>. The Irish held them off for 5 days, when they finally ran out of bullets and food. Note this transmission the Irish troops made to headquarters:
<div class="indent"> "We will hold out until our last bullet is spent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialogue">Could do with some whiskey</a>."
</div></li><li> Spartacus' Slave revolt culminated in a Last Stand of epic proportions as Spartacus and his 100,000 slaves faced Crassus and his army. Spartacus and his army had marched from Capua, in the south west, to the Alps in Northern Italy - and then <em>all the way</em> back to the southmost part of Italy, where they were trapped when boats taking them to Sicily failed to arrive. Crassus built a 30 mile wall to cut them off <em>and they still got through it</em> before being defeated. Crassus then decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">crucify 6,000 surviving slaves along Rome's main highway.</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Brest_Fortress">The Brest Fortress<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. On June 22, 1941, Brest Fortress was one of the first Soviet defenses to be attacked by German troops. Surrounded, a few defenders continued fighting for more than a month, facing overwhelming German troops and heavy artillery. The last defender of the Brest Fortress, Major Pyotr Gavrilov was taken prisoner on July 23, unable to fight any longer due to starvation and exhaustion. Apocryphal stories extend the resistance well into August and claim it only ended when Germans were forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill">flood the fort's basements using the local river</a> in view of an impending visit by Hitler and Mussolini to the city.
</li><li> The nine month defense of the 'Hero City' of Sevastopol and the fortress which overlooked the city. Besieged from the aftermath of the September 1941 Kiev Offensive until it fell in June 1942, more than 100,000 men died and 200,000 were wounded in its defense. The Soviets used secret underwater submarine pens built into the hill overlooking the city to supply, equip, and reinforce the defenders and evacuate the wounded. After several unsuccessful assaults the Germans under General Erich von Manstein had to use four Super Heavy Railway Guns (based on the main guns of Battleships), several batteries of Heavy Artillery, flamethrowers, and poison gas to take the fortress.

</li><li> The entire 62nd Army, which defended Stalingrad itself while other forces attacked the Germans' flanks, could be considered this. The fate of Soviet prisoners in German hands (death through starvation or hard labor) and the fact that they could not retreat because the Volgar river was behind them, apparently made it a little easier for them to be brave. The 62nd Army lost 100,000 men dead and the same again in wounded.
</li><li> The Battle of Berlin was this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a>. The Soviets blew the absolute shit out of the city, making the most of their total superiority in artillery and airpower. The last bastions of the Third Reich held out for a while, but were ultimately fighting a battle every sane man among them knew they weren't going to win. As it drew to a close <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> decided that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">Better to Die than Be Killed</a>, and shot himself in the head when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">even he</a> realized there was no way out.
</li><li> The Battle of Sadarapat, a turning point in the Armenian-Turkish War of 1918 in which the bigger and stronger Turkish army was bitterly defeated. It was said by historian Christopher J. Walker that had the Armenians not won the Battle of Sardarapat (which won Armenia's independence for a brief period), the word 'Armenia' might today only be an antique geographical term.
</li><li> Despite giving up in the end, Dien Bien Phu rightly belongs here. The casualties suffered and inflicted by the core battalions in this "Hell in a Very Small Place" before finally surrendering were appalling. Some of the Para and Legion battalions were down to 25- 40 walking wounded, and no unharmed, at the end from their supposed strength of 600-ish. Yet even on the last day they would counterattack enemy full-strength battalions when they lost a position, and succeed! CMoA from the most Badass Army of its time (the French Paras). You could add Stalingrad as well, both the German attack on it and the Cauldron itself.
</li><li> The fall of Constantinople in AD 1453 marked the end of the Roman Empire, which had been by far the most ancient country in the Western world, 2,206 years old. The last emperor, Constantine XI, chose to go out with a fight, rather than have the empire dismantled by submitting to the Ottoman sultan. With the Roman army barely being a city garrison by this point, he managed to get 7,000 defenders inside the city, both Greek and foreign. The night before the final battle, native Orthodox and foreign Catholic defenders held a joint service in the Hagia Sophia. The emperor's final address to his troops was as fitting as one could be for such an occasion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItHasBeenAnHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItHasBeenAnHonor">thanking them</a> for their service and and calling them "worthy heirs of the heroes of Ancient Greece and Rome." During the final assault, when the Ottomans finally breached the defenses, the emperor said, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">The city is fallen, yet I am alive</a>," and led his remaining troops in one last charge. His body was never found, and he became the Greek people's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain">King in the Mountain</a>.
<ul><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">final words</a> have alternately been recorded as, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">God forbid I should live, an Emperor without an Empire! As my city falls, I fall with it!</a> He then tore the imperial insignia from his armor and, together with a handful of friends, charged into a mass of Janissaries. This was the death of the last Emperor of Rome. Somewhere Romulus is smiling.
</li><li> 1,000 of the surviving Greek soldiers charging the mass of 120,000 Ottoman soldiers swarming over the walls in an effort to allow the rest of their comrades to escape. Courage doesn't even begin to describe it.

Both men volunteered to go down to a crashed Blackhawk and attempt to protect the surviving crew from hundreds of hostile militants. They were both overrun and killed by the attacking militants, but took at least 24 men with them. Michael Durant, the pilot of the Blackhawk, survived.

Chamberlain held his position, despite repeated attacks by the Confederates, mounting casualties, and low ammo, because retreat would mean the collapse of the entire Union line. It was only after running out of ammo that he ordered a full bayonet charge as a desperation move, which was so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">bold and unexpected</a> that the Confederates were forced to retreat.

Twenty-one Sikh soldiers defending a small but vital outpost on the Indian border were faced with twenty thousand Pashtun tribesmen armed with rifles and heavy cannons, and all of them volunteered to stay. They staved off the enemy army for most of a day before being overwhelmed, killing an estimate of eight hundred enemy troops and warning the British army of the attack, giving them time to prepare a defense and counterattack. When the British Parliament heard of the battle, it resulted in a standing ovation, and September 12 is now considered an official holiday in India.
<ul><li> The battle itself also had a last stand within a last stand: the Sikh signalman, the last soldier still standing, defended the signal shed with his bayonet, singlehandedly killing eighteen enemy soldiers. The tribesmen could only kill him by setting the entire signal shed ablaze, since no one was willing to go in and fight him.

After the chaos of the early war solidified into Gaddafi holding western Libya and the rebels holding eastern Libya, Misrata was one of a few rebel-held settlements in western Libya.

Going into badass mode, the 37 men killed several hundred warriors before running low on ammo, Major Wilson ordered Burnham to break out with two other troopers and bring back help. Burnham and the two others broke through the lines but reinforcements did not arrive in time as Wilson fought to his very last bullet, at which point, the few remaining British stood, sang "God Save the Queen", and shook hands with one another preparing for death.

In the final three days of the WW2 event known as the Falaise Pocket, the Polish armored divisions pushed to take a section of the mountain that would allow them to rain fire down on escaping German troops. As the United States took Chambois, this left Hill 262 as one of the few pathways to escape the pocket. From 19 August 1944 to 21 August, the Germans pushed against the Polish with reckless abandon, and by the night of the 20th, the Polish were exhausted and dangerously low on supplies. The quote below is from their CO, Lt. Col. Stefanowicz, as he broke the news to his remaining.
<div class="indent">Gentlemen, all is lost. I do not think that the Canadians can come to our rescue. We have only about 110 able-bodied men [of 3500 in the division] left.

The Japanese battle plan for Leyte Gulf was to send its carrier forces north, to draw the US Navy's battle fleet northward and expose the Leyte landings to annihilation by the still-powerful Japanese battleship fleet. This actually worked - Admiral Halsey, in charge of the extremely powerful US Third Fleet and believing the surface battle was essentially over, took all his forces northward while failing to notify anyone at Leyte that he was no longer defending nor even monitoring their northern flank. Admiral Kurita slipped through the San Bernadino Straight with the the Imperial Japanese Navy's Center Force, consisting of the superbattleship <em>Yamato</em>, three additional battleships, six heavy and two light cruisers, plus eleven destroyers. With Third Fleet hundreds of miles away on Halsey's snipe hunt, Kurita's force was poised to steam directly for the Leyte landings and unleash an unsurvivable naval barrage agains the defenseless beacheads and the tens of thousands of Marines and sailors occupying them.
<ul><li> Before this could happen, Center Force came across Task Force 77.4.3 ("Taffy 3"), a group of 6 escort carriers defended by 3 destroyers and 4 destroyer escorts. This was a portion of Task Force 77.4, in total 18 escort carriers and defending destroyers. These units were equipped for land bombing and close air support as well as defense against submarines, patrol boats, and other small vessels - none of the Taffy 3 carriers had any anti-ship weaponry such as armor-piercing bombs or torpedoes.
</li><li> Not knowing Halsey left the San Bernadino Straight open, Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, in charge of Taffy 3, had no warning prior to seeing the unstoppable Center Force in gun range. With nowhere to run (only his destroyers were fast enough to flee Japanese battleships), and heavy US units at least hours away, Admiral Clifton Sprague had only one thing to say: "Small boys attack." Utilizing the cold equations, the more precious escort carriers (in both men and material) were withdrawn under cover of smoke. Meanwhile, a handful of destroyers and destroyer-escorts took the initiative to engage the guns of the Japanese battle line, with no hope beyond drawing lethal Japanese gunfire away from their defenseless escort carriers.
</li><li> Stunningly, this worked. A fair portion of this can be ascribed to Japanese incompetence, likely magnified by Admiral Kurita's sleep-deprived state (he was going on three days straight without sleep). Kurita's forces incorrectly identified Taffy 3 as 3 full-sized fleet carriers, 3 cruisers, and 3 destroyers (the relative sizes of these ships being comprable to escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts). This caused him to make a series of errors:
<ul><li> For reasons unfathomable, instead of organizing a battle line and destroying every ship of Taffy 3 in a matter of minutes, he ordered "general attack" so that each of his ships could fire and maneuver individually rather than contribute to an organized attack plan.
</li><li> Thinking he was engaging armored ships, he ordered armor-piercing shells, which do not detonate when passing through unarmored ships. Many shell hits against Taffy 3 did minimal damage.
</li><li> Thinking he was engaging much larger ships, his gunlayers had a terrible time determining range (they weren't big ships far away, they were small ships much closer)
</li><li> Thinking he was engaging 6 fleet carriers, he believed he was facing Halsey's all-powerful Third Fleet, which meant the attempt to draw this heavy force northward failed, and it was Kurita who was in a trap and not the other way around. As such, he profoundly overestimated the risk of these (brave but ill-equipped) second-line air attacks.
</li></ul></li><li> Regardless of the above advantages (which the Americans could not have known at the time) Taffy 3 effectively found itself embroiled in naval gunfight where its only hope was to dodge battleship and cruiser guns while taking potshots with 5-inch shells and desperately manuvering into torpedo range.
</li><li> The ferocity and bravery of the US destroyers and destroyer-escorts frightened the Japanese gunlayers to the point their fire control broke down; destroyers and destroyer-escorts successfully manuvered into knife-fighting range and tore apart the Japanese cruisers with well-laid 5-inch guns and torpedoes.
</li><li> The end result? One of the most lopsided battles in history, and a crushing defeat. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Of the Japanese</a></em>. For the loss of two destroyers, a destroyer escort, and two escort carriers, the Americans sunk three of the heavy cruisers and severely damaged three more, and drove off <em>the largest battleship in history</em>.

The church was the hiding place of Jan Kubi, Jozef Gabčík, and a handful of other Czechoslovak resistance fighters who had participated in the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich (who was the highest ranking Nazi official ever assassinated). The Nazis, enraged, sent a unit of 750 soldiers to the church. Armed with no more than small handguns, the resistance group held off the soldiers' attempts to storm the church for more than two hours, despite the Nazis being armed with machine guns, grenades, and tear gas (there was also an attempt to flood the church which the resistance fighters thwarted).

He conceded that the war was lost... and the last thing he would do was to take his trusted 10 men, and then charge like a madman towards the enemy camp, aiming to take the head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TokugawaIeyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>. With just his trusted men, Sanada broke through the Tokugawa defense line, taking as many men as he could until he nearly was able to lop off Ieyasu's head, but at that point, fatigue caught up to him and he succumbed to his injuries, or some of Tokugawa's men struck back before he could take another step. Either way, Yukimura died, but not after he made one hell of a Last Stand that Tokugawa praised his burning warrior spirit, dubbing him 'Japan's #1 Soldier'.
</li><li> The reason why Bonnie and Clyde were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleGunshotDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleGunshotDeath">machine-gunned to pieces in an ambush by several policemen</a> was because they explicitly wanted to defy this trope — the cops knew that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple">Outlaw Couple</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> for a good reason, because it would fight to the last (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">and surely expected to go out like that</a>), and was very heavily armed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopKillerManhunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopKillerManhunt">They didn't wanted to give them the satisfaction.</a>
</li><li> The last battle of the Wehrmacht's 9th and 12th armies during the fall of Germany. Well aware of what the fate would probably be for civilians stranded in Russian territory rather than American territory, the surviving soldiers of these two forces formed a literal corridor and fought to the last man to evacuate as many civilians to American lines as they could. They ended up saving some 250,000 people. Immortalized by Sabaton's song Heart's of Iron, particularly the line in German: It's not a battle, it is a rescue mission.
</li><li> Italian forces had two during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> in the aftermath of the annihilation of the Second Army at Caporetto and the consequent retreat of the Italian armies:
<ul><li> During the retreat, the Duke of Aosta, commander of the Third Army, had an infantry brigade and a cavalry one hold a rearguard action against pursuing Austro-Hungarian and German forces totaling three divisions. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pozzuolo">They were almost wiped out, but held long enough to allow the Third Army to retreat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> After Caporetto it was pretty much expected that the Austro-Hungarian forces, temporarily supported by the Germans, would overrun the Veneto region, and the Fourth Army was deployed on the Grappa Massif and the Piave river with orders to resist to the last so to allow the retreat of the remaining forces to the Mincio river, where British and French reinforcements were being deployed. In the <em>First</em> Battle of the Piave, the Fourth Army, supported by the remnants of the Second Army and the spontaneous decision of the soldiers from the other armies to fight on that river, held until the enemy forces had to stop to regroup and resupply, at which point the decimated German Alpenkorps was redeployed to France.
</li><li> The Third Battle of the Piave, also known as Battle of Vittorio Veneto from the site of the decisive breakthrough, was the last stand of the entire Austro-Hungarian Empire, as they offered a formidable resistance even as the nation they were fighting for collapsed under the weight of the battle.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Fort Vaux siege of World War I, German army outnumbered the French defenders by more than <em>8 to 1</em>. Yet the French army managed to hold out by attacking the German invaders from inside the fort's underground tunnels and managed to inflict a 50% casualty rate on the Germans. Although the French were forced to surrender due to dwindling supplies, their defense became a landmark moment on the western front with the Crown Prince Wilhelm, commander of the German forces, presenting a French officer's sword to the captured Major Raynal as a sign of respect.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Dead_Men">The german assault on Osowiec Fortress<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, aka <em>the Attack of the Dead Men</em>, where Paul von Hindenburg initially gave the order to bombard the fortress with poison gas rather than assault it outright. The 7000 german troops did not expect any resistance when they subsequently moved in to take the fortress, but suddenly found themselves meeting a counter charge consisting of the surviving defenders (a 100 or so in total) who had wrapped themselves in clothes in order to act like homemade gas masks and with visible chemical burns and rooting flesh from the chlorine/bromine gases. The sight of these "zombies" made the unprepared germans panic and many ended up shoot dead as they pulled a uncoordinated and hasty retreat. The Russians managed to hold on to the fortress for another 12 days before they had to withdraw or risk being encircled.
</li><li> During the Third Punic War, the Carthaginian people knew that it was all over for them...Rome had backed them into a corner and forced them to war with impossible demands. Their response? An all-out defense of their city, holding the Romans at bay for <em>three years,</em> and when the Romans finally battered their way in, fighting house-to-house and selling their lives and city as dear as they could. Rome won the war, but paid a very high price, and Scipio, the Roman general in command, was seen to weep over the destruction.
</li><li> The Aztecs may have been bloodthirsty conquerors, but nobody ever called them cowards. Even with their empire mostly revolted against them, racked with diseases they couldn't fight, and up against vastly superior technology, they fought like maniacs to defend their capital of Tenochtitlan. Hugh Thomas said: "For a time, (Cortes) and his friends seem to have been looked upon by some Mexica at least as being reincarnations of deities. But in the end, to be honest, it had been the Mexica who fought like gods."
