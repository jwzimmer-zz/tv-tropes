Maybe a hero's morals and convictions are so strong that he can never be bought out, not even for all the money and riches in the world. Maybe someone is so committed to a goal he'll spend all the money he has to in order to reach it. Or perhaps there are some people who just don't need the money; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood">warm fuzzy feeling after doing a good deed is reward enough</a>.

</li><li> What Nao and Akiyama do in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame">Liar Game</a></em>. In fact, Nao's reason for continuing to participate in the game is to save everyone in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> did this. A greedy money grubber tried to bribe him, but his bodyguard pointed out that Kenshin was never interested in money. Later on, even the bodyguard, who took the job more for the eventual fights than for the money, would no longer respect the money grubber.
<ul><li> Satou Hajime also made it very clear to one unfortunate rich guy that a bribe won't save you if he has you in his crosshairs.

</li></ul></li><li> Hideo Ozu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HandMaidMay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HandMaidMay">Hand Maid May</a></em> provides an infuriating example when he turns down 10 million yen in exchange for old videos he shot of his aspiring-actress childhood friend, Mai. But rather than keeping the videos, he simply gives them away for free to Mai's producer, who had told him that the videos<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note021c6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note021c6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note021c6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (which as far as we know, are not pornographic or scandalous in any way)</span> could get in the way of Mai's acting career. And when it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the producer and director intend to profit from the videos by integrating them into their new movie</span>, he gets indignant about the videos that were "taken" from him.
</li><li> Both Natsu and Erza do this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> when offered obscene amounts of money as a reward for various jobs they've taken. In the first case, Natsu turns down the reward because he can tell that the man offering wouldn't be well off after, and because even if their actions throughout the arc have made him happier than if they carried out the job as they asked, they didn't carry out the job the way he'd initially specified. Later, Erza does this with a job that has been completed properly and then some, because when Natsu and Lucy first took it, they didn't have the guild's permission, and it was never officially accepted. However, while she does turn down a whopping 7 million Jewels (Yen by another name), she isn't above accepting a one of a kind summoning tool they were also offering.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee won't allow it's members to bill the people they help, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Leon</a> calls out on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Yuffie</a> to not bill a woman she just saved.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">manga version</a>, Seto Kaiba offers Grandpa Moto a huge briefcase full of rare cards and then an absurd amount of money for his Blue-Eyes White Dragon card. Grandpa refuses, saying it was given to him by one of his best friends, so it is irreplaceable. Undaunted, Kaiba then takes it by force.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> featured the seagoing duelist Anacis. An incredibly wealthy man (among his possessions were a gold and gem encrusted Duel Disk and a submarine with a private dueling arena) he was also very shallow and arrogant, and thought anyone and anything could be bought. Unfortunately for him, his attempt to recruit Judai into his new project through bribery (even though the amount he offered was the equivalent of over a million dollars) failed; Judai's loyalty to Duel Academy and his allies was more important than money. During their duel, Anacis offers Judai an obscene amount of money to reduce his life points (subbed version) or forfeit (dubbed version), but Judai again refuses.

Miksja stops half way and says she is too honorable to run without paying and would rather take punishment even if it means being lynched by the fairies.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a>, Silver Sable fails to capture Spider-Man. She refuses to admit failure, drop the job, and go away. "My reputation is everything to me. We'll finish the job for you. Comped. No charge."
<ul><li> This trope appears quite often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>.</em> Probably played straightest when Spider-Man intervenes to save Boomarang, a C-grade bank robber, from being terminated with extreme prejudice by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>, and the villain gratefully offers him $20,000 to get him away from the cops. Poor student Peter is clearly tempted for a moment before webbing the villain up beside the Punisher for the cops to collect.

<ul><li> Appears in one case where Silver Sable and Captain America are involved. Spider-Man is offered a million in cash and flatly turns it down. It helped that the one offering was the the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a>. Of course, the Skull can't resist goading the hero before ordering his goons to attack:
<div class="indent"><strong>Skull</strong>: Tsk. Patriotism must produce its own hormone. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">One that promotes stupidity.</a> Kill him.

</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a>'s run on the book, Spider-Man faced Digger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">a radioactive zombie created from the corpses of 13 slain mobsters</a>. Forelli, the mobster who ordered the hit on the "Vegas 13", offered to pay Spider-Man to take him down. After a bit of soul-searching, Spider-Man seemed to avert this trope by accepting the money (albeit after confirming that he was being asked to do nothing but keep in contact with Forelli, who he already suspected was Digger's main target, to protect him from Digger, which Spidey would do if he was in the area when Digger attacked Forelli anyway), but ultimately played it straight by donating the money to the school where Peter Parker was teaching to build a new library.
</li><li> In another story, Spider-Man acquired a briefcase of laundered, untraceable cash. He then gave it to the Vulture, because he knew the Vulture's daughter and granddaughter were struggling and the Vulture could use the money to help them. This actually fits with Spider-Man's character, as he'd rather use the money that way then end up fighting the Vulture for robbing banks to get money for them.

<ul><li> In a rare villainous example, Locke chooses to torture some of his noble captives rather than ransom them because he resents that they can buy their way out of trouble - and he's aware that taking some bribes will end very badly for him. He'll ransom them if the reward is high enough, but seeing them suffer is its own reward. On the other hand, in Brienne's case, Qyburn notes that Locke could have taken the ransom offered by Brienne's father if Jaime had not earlier led Locke to believe that Brienne's father is far richer than he actually is, ironically in an attempt to protect Brienne. It's his impression of being cheated that leads him to say "well, to Hell with her!".
</li><li> Balon Greyjoy <strong>detests</strong> the very idea of buying something with money. To him, the only price worth paying is 'the iron price'  i.e. to take it from someone you have killed yourself... Note that the words of House Greyjoy are, "We do not sow"as in, Why be a farmer when you could be a huge bully instead and steal what other people have built? But as Balon found out the hard way, being a bully only works until you run up against someone strong enough to fight back, as evidenced by the brutal ass-kicking he received from Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon.

<ul><li> Dr. House cost the hospital <em>one hundred million</em> dollars because he refused to kiss the ass of a billionaire donor who wanted House to publicly praise a new drug produced by his company<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3upzc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3upzc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3upzc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note that House <em>gave</em> the speech, over his own objections, but the donor <em>didn't like it</em> because House wasn't <em>enthusiastic enough</em> for him!</span>. The incident was the culmination of a series of confrontations between House and the donor over him trying to dictate hospital policy and procedure, and was really just the last straw which convinced the man House would <em>never</em> play ball. The hospital's refusal to terminate House's employment (because there weren't really any grounds for it) resulted in the donor backing out of his promised contribution. Without solid research to support his endorsement, House could've been in serious legal trouble if he had made the proposed speech - the Vioxx and Bextra lawsuits of the last decade were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples of that same concern. Furthermore, the show reveals that there was a pre-existing drug that was just as good as the new one, but cheaper and more readily available.

Screw the money, I have rules to thumb my nose at? (It also shows how skewed Vogler's priorities are, even by his own standards, that when he mentions this incident during a board meeting, he focuses on the car, rather than on the fact that House's conduct on this case is, if anything, <em>more</em> ethical than some of his other cases).

<ul><li> Booth accuses him of it at one point, when he conceals his past association with a victim in order to be allowed to work on the case, but it was actually about trying to find his friend's killer, not about feeling entitled to do whatever he wants. Hodgins even submits his resignation over this, which immediately patches things between him and Booth (when Hodgins asks Booth if they need to talk about this any more, Booth just orders him a drink and says "What are we, girls?"). After the case is successfully won, Carolina (the prosecutor) convinces Cam to tear up the letter.
</li><li> Later, when a serial killer/hacker targets the team, the bad guy targets Hodgins's billions. Hodgins then faces a dilemma: the siphoning of the money can be stopped, thus allowing him to keep his money, or he can allow the money to be taken and let the FBI track where it goes in hopes of catching the hacker. Naturally, he chooses the latter. He and Angela end up living paycheck-to-paycheck (despite her rich father). Then Bones and Booth decide to help them financially. Many episodes later, Angela manages to track down the money, only for Hodgins to refuse it and tell her to give it all away to charities, as he has grown accustomed to not having it and does not believe that billions can make them any happier than they are now. He does, however, end up at least somewhat rich again due to an invention he patented and sold, but nothing much changes really.

<ul><li> Played with in "Battlin' Jack" Murdock's decision not to throw the fight against Creel. He knew it would cost him his life but he could not let Matt down, wanting Matt to hear the crowd cheer for him one more time.
</li><li> Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson chose to start their own practice in Hell's Kitchen rather than get fast-tracked at Landman &amp; Zack because even though L&amp;Z would have paid better, they also were known for representing very shady clients. The final straw was when they saw their bosses seeking damages against a man who suffered terminal illness due to the shady practices of an L&amp;Z client. Which was also a good thing in the long run since most of L&amp;Z turns out to be in Wilson Fisk's pocket.
</li><li> Wilson Fisk tries to bribe Karen into silence after she leaks evidence of corruption at Union Allied to the media.

</div></li><li> Foggy is more in favor of trying to toe the line between making money and growing Nelson &amp; Murdock with being ethical and helping people than Matt is. Example: when James Wesley hires them to defend John Healy, Foggy is initially quick to accept simply due to the size of Wesley's check. Once he meets Healy, he quickly realizes Wesley wants them to defend an obviously guilty sociopath and he doesn't want anything to do with him, money be damned.
</li><li> Fisk finds himself dealing with this in a minor subplot late in season 3.

She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">bluntly tells</a> Fisk that she refuses to sell because the painting originally belonged to her family, until it was stolen by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGestapo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGestapo">the Nazis</a> when they took her family to the Warsaw Ghetto and killed them.

<ul><li> Many games cause the player to invoke this (even if your character has a different view on the matter), by simply showering you with money. It gets worse in that any time you're asked to give away a substantial amount (for "charity" or otherwise), you'll typically end up with a more valuable reward. Frequently, you have no use for the cash in the first place; there's no penalty for losing it, because there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">nothing to buy</a>, or because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider">it's easy enough to get more</a>.
</li><li> An interesting case happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoundByFlame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoundByFlame">Bound by Flame</a></em>. Even if the plan of a group of sages to save the world seems entirely hopeless, the Freeborn Blades mercenaries escort them all the way to the site of the planned final battle, because they always complete every contract to the very end. When the sages are unable to get to the gold that would have been the payment, the captain doesn't really care, since money has long become worthless with no more towns to spend it being left. But even if it's the end of the world, nobody shall ever say that the Freeborn Blades do not keep their part of a contract.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, wherein you can almost always demand/request a reward for your services without repercussion. Meanwhile, giving charitable donations doesn't get you any kind of reward whatsoever, it just means you lose money. On the other hand, even when you are offered the chance to make a questionable moral decision, money isn't usually part of the reward. So what kind of hero are you, anyway?

<ul><li> Inverted with Zaeed's mission; the reward for Paragon is considerably a lot more than if Shepard helps Zaeed in his quest for revenge. This is because your mission is to rescue an industrial plant and its workers, which is mutually exclusive to helping Zaeed, who tries blowing it up in the process of his revenge against Vido. While Zaeed will pay you for helping fulfil his personal vendetta, the plant's owner will pay you double for saving their property.

He doesnt want money, nor does he want women (which he acknowledges would be an impossible demand anyway), his sole demand is that he get to pick the lead actor, and picks Homer Simpson because Everyman is supposed to look like an average dumpy loser. The studio is eventually forced to agree since it's the only hold they have on him, but get around it by having Homer work with a personal trainer to make him more physically attractive. At this point, it becomes a subversion, as CBG has gone Hollywood by the time Homers training is done and is no longer keeping track of the production.

</li><li> Corsair. In the world of power suppliers, where every manufacturer tries to inflate the specifications of their products, Corsair asked the independent organization 80plus.org to downgrade the rating of two of their products because they felt that, while the particular samples had achieved "Gold" ratings, they believed most of the units they had designed would only achieve "Silver." As much pragmatic as noble, however, as the backlash from a notable discrepancy between the review figures and actual user experience would <em>not</em> have been good for business.

</li><li> Most of the world's major religions have some variant of this as a commandment to their followers. Of course, whether a specific person of that faith actually <em>practices</em> it kinda depends on the person...
</li><li> This is the ethos of much of alternative culture, from music to film. (This is somewhat tautological, as "alternative" is defined as those who lack mainstream amounts of money.)
</li><li> Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield offered $300,000 to Occupy Wall Street. Linnea Palmer Paton's response was "Right now, we have a system where the wealthy design, create, build, and have control over what happens. And I think it's very important that the wealthy do not have that power." <a class="urllink" href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/01/ben-jerry-raise-cool-occupy-cash-get-activists-cold-shoulder/">Read more<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> This sometimes poignantly comes into play during end-of-life care in hospitals. People have been known to beg, plead, and offer large sums of cash to hospital workers if they will save them or their dying relative, not completely realizing that when a doctor says "There's nothing that can be done", it literally means just that. Even more tragic is the steady parade of really sleazy people (spiritualists, faith healers, unethical medical providers) who will gladly take as much money as you are willing to give to offer up some false hope or reassurances. This is usually especially true with people who have been very wealthy for their entire lives; if all your life you have never been denied anything, it can be hard to comprehend that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyIsNotPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyIsNotPower">there is something in life that money just can't buy.</a>

</li><li> Mississippi State University has a longstanding tradition of ringing cowbells during their football games in lieu of clapping. If you've ever attended a game, the noise can be staggering. The NCAA told the school that if it continued, they would be fined. They agreed to pay the fine, partly on principle, and partly to not upset their tradition-concerned fans, who pay them way more than they were to be fined.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> shocked the world when he suddenly turned down a 50 million dollar contract to keep his hit show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em> going for several more years. Even more shocking, he left the country and went to spend time in Africa not telling anyone. When he finally got back, he did several interviews telling the fans why. These reasons ranged from him realizing a certain segment of the viewers liked his show for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMinstrelsy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMinstrelsy">wrong reasons</a>, to people behind the scenes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">telling him what he can and can't do</a> on the show, which meant the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpStairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpStairs">really wasn't his</a> anymore if he signed. There's also him being tired of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">strange practices</a> that he noticed in the entertainment industry in general.
</li><li> It's a somewhat well-known fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey">Jim Carrey</a> has a very strict "No Sequels" policy, which he still refused to compromise when he was one of the highest paid entertainers in Hollywood.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4wmbn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4wmbn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4wmbn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He only appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AceVentura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AceVentura">Ace Ventura</a>: When Nature Calls</em> (one of only two sequels on his resumé, and the one which lead to his policy) because of contractual obligations, and it took him <em>twenty years</em> to agree to star in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DumbAndDumberTo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DumbAndDumberTo">Dumb and Dumber To</a></em>.</span> How committed is he to that policy? In 1995, he turned down a $10 million paycheck—at the time, the highest sum ever offered to an actor for a single role—to reprise his role as Stanley Ipkiss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask">The Mask</a> II</em>. Even though not all of Carrey's movies have been what most would call "high art", he takes his integrity as an actor very seriously, believing that reprising a role is a waste of time because it doesn't challenge his acting ability. Presumably, he made an exception for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DumbAndDumberTo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DumbAndDumberTo">Dumb and Dumber To</a></em> because he considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap">playing a twenty-years-older Lloyd Christmas</a> to be a worthwhile acting challenge.
</li><li> Some police forces have a reputation for being extremely principled or immune to bribery.
<ul><li> The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are globally renowned for being professional, efficient, and unyielding: while local police are more or less just that, and pretty individual, the RCMP is known as the group you do not want to mess with. Usually they're handing out traffic citations, or chilling out on horses, or just doing normal police work. But when they go full bore on a crime, they have <em>enormous</em> power, and <em>extreme</em> financing to back it up. If you only know them from their checkerboard hats and red tunics, and think them to be a joke, they will <em>ruin you</em>, and no amount of money or power will deter them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">But at least they're very polite about it.</a>
</li><li> Chilean cops are famous for never accepting bribes and hauling the people attempting to do so into the station and charging them. This frequently happens to tourists who are pulled over for traffic violations and figure that every South American cop must be willing to accept a bribe. Instead of a small fine, they end up in jail.
</li><li> German Polizei are another famous group. Take that German efficiency and adherence to the rules and apply it to a police force.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1982, seven people in Chicago were killed when they took poisoned Tylenol. Johnson &amp; Johnson's response? Halt the production and advertising of Tylenol, and issue a nationwide recall. This cost them an enormous sum of money, but more than made up for it in the public goodwill it generated.
</li><li> In 1994, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Pearl Jam</a> launched a three-year boycott of Ticketmaster, the largest concert ticket seller in the US, out of a belief that they were a monopoly that was ripping off music fans, going so far as to file an official antitrust complaint with the Department of Justice and testify before Congress on the matter. This move essentially derailed the band's mainstream success by making it far more difficult for them to tour nationally (most major concert venues were contracted with Ticketmaster, forcing them to play at much smaller arenas and theaters in smaller cities and towns), and even caused drummer Dave Abbruzzese to leave the band because he disagreed with the boycott.
</li><li> A far more notorious example from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">grunge</a> era was that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a> frontman who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">killed himself</a> because he couldn't reconcile his anti-establishment punk values with his newfound stardom. In his <a class="urllink" href="https://kurtcobainssuicidenote.com/kurt_cobains_suicide_note.html">suicide note<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he stated that he felt like a phony standing on stage and trying to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRockStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRockStar">The Rock Star</a>.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> was hit with financial problems over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U's</a> lackluster sales in 2014, many of their higher ups <a class="urllink" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-01-29-nintendo-boss-iwata-halves-pay-miyamotos-wage-cut-too">announced<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that they would each take a 20-50% pay cut in order to avoid any major lay offs of their employees at the time. Former Nintendo president <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata">Satoru Iwata</a> had previously taken a pay cut when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> initially released to poor sales as well.
</li><li> American officials are <em>LEGENDARILY</em> hard to bribe. In fact, trying to bribe one is a very good way to get yourself in even bigger trouble than you're already in. Zealous I.R.S inspections are a good deterrent.
