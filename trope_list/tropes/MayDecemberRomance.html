</p><p>Due to continued confusion over the applicability of this trope, here are the criteria that need to be satisfied to qualify for inclusion here:
</p><p></p><ul><li> Presuming normal human lifespans, the partners must be at least 30 years apart in age and at different stages of life. Presuming normal human lifespans, the older needs to be <strong>at least 50</strong> and of a senior citizen age. Similarly, the younger can be <strong>no more than 35</strong>, because the younger one is in the spring of their life.
</li><li> The ages are from when the relationship <em>started</em>. If a 50-year-old and an 85-year-old are a couple, this trope would qualify if they've been together for 30 years, but not if they started dating last week.
</li><li> Age is based on time actually <em>living</em>. Time spent frozen or otherwise in a suspended state is irrelevant. If a character goes into suspension at age 30 and comes out 100 years later, they're 30, <strong>not</strong> 130, for the purposes of this trope. Time travel also does not count, for example, a romance between a contemporary and a person of similar age but born decades in their future. An arguable exception is if said time traveller falls in love with someone from decades past, returns to the present, and finds out that person is still alive (albeit elderly) and there are still feelings between them.
</li><li> The difference has to be noted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a></em> as an unusually large age gap. The ages of the actors are immaterial. Thanks to Hollywood <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">double standards</a> against older actresses, many a film will cast an older male actor whose character's age is deliberately vague, meanwhile his female love interest is played by an actress young enough to be his daughter, but the gap is never brought up within the film itself. This applies to both live-action and voice acting.
</li><li> This is a Romance trope. There has to be an actual romantic relationship of at least a modest length to qualify; brief flings or one-off encounters don't qualify.
</li><li> For creatures with lifespans different from the human normal (extended or ephemeral), apply the above rules generally. If a 1,000-year-old ageless vampire is dating a 100-year-old vampire, this trope could apply, but not if they are dating a 500-year-old vampire. You might consider <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance">MayflyDecember Romance</a> instead, where one creature has a (much) longer life expectancy than the other (but isn't always in different stages of life). For example when one partner is a normal human and the other is, for example, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Human Alien</a> who might age much slower by our standards.
</li></ul><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is an OBJECTIVE trope, meaning that it uses explicitly defined criteria; it is <strong>NOT</strong> a place to put any relationship which feels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicky</a> due to age differences. 30-year-olds dating 13-year-olds are not this trope.
</p><p>This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, of course, but wasn't nearly as common in the past as some would have us think. Most couples in pre-modern days couldn't afford to marry until both the man and the woman had saved up enough to set up a household, and that could take years; it's therefore perhaps not surprising that the average ages at marriage for both men and women in Elizabethan England are identical to those in 21st century America where most of all married couples are within two to three years of each other. (It was even worse in medieval times when daughters would have to work for years to save up the customary fee owed their father's lord upon their marriage.)
</p><p>Most May-December marriages in pre-19th century times were among the aristocracy, whose prominence in the history books is balanced by their small numbers (fewer than 0.5% of the population of Tudor England). Victorian-era historians, however, twisted the narrative, going as far as to destroy and deface records, to justify child marriage. At best their scholarship was unconsciously biased by their desire to justify their own cultural norms; at worst they deliberately lied.

Kunikida actually points this out in the beginning in an attempt to encourage Ryoko to date men more her own age but when she convinces him that she wants <em>him</em>, age difference be damned, he gives in.
</li><li> The plot (and central character) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop">Bunny Drop</a></em> come about because of the relationship developed between the male lead's grandfather and the twenty-something Masako, who worked in his home as a helper (though whether it was romantic on her part is debatable). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The grandfather is later revealed to not be the sire of Rin and was only helping Masako deal with her unsuitability towards motherhood at the time. Masako seems to harbour romantic feelings, or at least some infatuation, for the old chap though. As it turns out, the two lead characters will finally end up in this situation later on, for real.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, 16-year-old Rosette is sweet on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> Father Remington, who publicly claims to be 27, and is actually at least 72.
</li><li> Several of these relationships are seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>... and <em>none</em> of them end well, as more often than not one of the partners ends up dead <em>and</em> the other is either the murderer or one of the suspects. In an example, we have the writer Daisuke Torakura (in his 50s) and his wife Etsuko (mid-20s); <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he forced her to marry him via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum">Scarpia Ultimatum</a>, and both she and her lover Hamura are among the suspects of his murder. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Neither of them did it</a>.)</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gravitation">Gravitation</a></em>, 28-year-old Noriko is married to the university professor Tetsuya Ukai who looks old enough to be her grandfather. It's implied that he might not be as old as he appears, though.
</li><li> In the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave">Gungrave</a></em>, there was Harry and Sherry. Sherry was only twelve and Harry was a full-grown man when they first met. Maria and Big Daddy is a more obvious example.
</li><li> Tatsuya Tsugawa's parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HekikaiNoAiON" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HekikaiNoAiON">Hekikai no AiON</a></em>. His father is thirty by the time his mother is born. They later meet, and his father earns his mothers affection, and she agrees to marry him. Other than these details, little is known about them or their relationship, as they are already dead when the manga begins. They are mostly mentioned in passing by the other characters.
</li><li> Midori in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em>, who is 24 (although she tries to convince others that she's 17), is romantically interested in her professor, who is in his mid-fifties.

A big problem with this trope in Comic books is the dual issue of the confusion of the <strong>character's</strong> age with the age from when the comic was first published, and the continual retcons and universe changes that are common (particularly in the last several decades) which completely re-write character histories. In particular, a large number of heroes/villains are problematic for this trope, due to extended human lifespans, but not quite long enough to qualify as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a> or similar. Many of their pairings are more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayFlyDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayFlyDecemberRomance">May Fly December Romance</a>, but due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>, it's hard to categorize them. Please be careful with adding entries here.
<hr/><ul><li> In another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> managed to have it both ways. Originally, Black Canary was the native of Earth 2 (which was populated by DC's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> heroes), while Green Arrow was the native of Earth 1 (which was populated by the more contemporary heroes). In other words, Black Canary was at least twenty years older than Green Arrow. This wasn't that big of a deal back in the late 1960s when the relationship was originally introduced, but as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a> widened their age difference, Black Canary was retconned into being the original's daughter who thought she was the original Black Canary due to memory tampering (a long, very convoluted story). A few years later, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbok/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbok/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis On Infinite Earths</a> retconned all of that out. In the new continuity, the Black Canary that Green Arrow dated was always the original's daughter, and Green Arrow was now at least a decade older than her.
</li><li> In DC Comics example, the original Liberty Belle (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> heroine whose aging was slowed thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>), got engaged to a man a few decades her junior. It didn't end well.
</li><li> Turning back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>, Spitfire, a 1940s superheroine, had a relationship with the much younger third Union Jack on the pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvaders">New Invaders</a></em> after the blood transfusion from the original <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanTorch">Human Torch</a> caused her to body to de-age a few decades. The relationship didn't last, in part because of the age difference.
</li><li> There is quite a bit of it in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">the X-Men franchise</a>, starting with Professor Xavier's repressed crush on Jean Grey; this was written at a time when he was supposed to be in his twenties or thirties, so it was not as extreme an age difference as it was when they reused that plot element in the 1990s for the Onslaught arc. Occasionally it verges into May-September or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance">MayflyDecember Romance</a> territory as characters are rejuvenated through comic book-science means or have powers that render them impervious to the effects of aging. Thus Magneto in the main timeline has the body of a man in his 30s since being de-aged and partially re-aged, which takes some of the sting out of his relationships with Cyclops' ex-girlfriend Lee Forrester and with Rogue. On a more mundane level, there was Cannonball (16 years old at the time) and rockstar Lila Cheney.
</li><li> Nancy and Hartigan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em>. He doesn't go so far as to actually sleep with her, since he thinks he's way too old (around 65 at the end of the story) to enter a relationship with a 19-year old, but they do share several very passionate kisses, and he describes her as "the love of my life" in his internal monologue. This is really a subversion, as Hartigan explicitly rejects the relationship due to the age difference (and the fact that he first met her when he saved her from the pedophilic villain of "That Yellow Bastard" when she was <em>eleven</em>).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AmericanVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AmericanVampire">American Vampire</a></em>, Jim Book's goddaughter Abilena fell in love with him. He was oblivious until she kissed him the night he faced the vampirized Skinner. He was squicked at first and refused to reciprocate. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When he asks Abilena to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> him as his vampiric urges became stronger and stronger, she agreed...but only if he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy">gave her a child</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz">Viz</a></em> had a one-off strip with a comic called "Bert Midler, Biddy-Fiddler" about a perverted young man with a fetish for very elderly women.

Ironically, Lorraine's own mother has the opposite reaction: Lorraine said her fiance was younger, not that he was white.
