<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"You'd think I'd be used to it by now. But they keep finding new angles to torture me with."</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></strong>, inner monologue. It's unclear if he means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">his villains or his writers.</a>
</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Your character is angsting. It seems that his dog just died in a freak accident. That accident involved his kindly uncle, who didn't swerve in time to avoid the poor puppy. However, he did swerve in time to go off an embankment and hit a bus full of high school students, killing many, including the character's beloved girlfriend, to whom he'd just been engaged the previous day. Unfortunately, the shock of the news caused the protagonist's kindly old mother to have a heart attack, which left his father devastated. More unfortunately, economic recession hits, and the character and his father are left without a job and sunk neck deep in debt. The character's brother turns to robbery but is caught and thrown in prison. Poor Daddy turned to drinking and lost all will to live, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">finally shot himself</a> (along with several others in a mad shootout), leaving the character all alone in the world to deal with the trauma. And that just happens to be the day when the mother of all earthquakes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">lays waste to the whole city, including the character's house.</a> Our character (who now has to live on the streets) is pulled out of the ruins, perhaps having suffered a crippling injury, and is taken to the hospital, where the doctor diagnoses him with cancer. Boy, what a day.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>And that's just the <em>beginning</em> of his bad days... Wait, what? Isn't this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">a little too overboard</a>?
</p><p>Deus Angst Machina is something of the polar opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> in terms of cause, but can come across as no less frustrating. Simply put, the character in question has every reason in the world to retreat into himself and become a brooding, angsty person, because his life really <em>does</em> suck as much as he thinks it does. However, the circumstances seem entirely too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">contrived</a>. This is a step beyond the coincidences that most stories tend towards to build up drama, as the character seems to have provoked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">some sadistic god</a> who is now dedicated to making his life as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">miserable</a> (and angst-filled) as possible. Sure, <em>anyone</em> would be miserable in his situation, but when said situation is less likely than being struck by lightning, it can seem to be outright ludicrous. If used too much, it can cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>, and if done with careful consideration and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">appropriate acknowledgment of just how unlikely it all is</a>, it can be justified.
</p><p>A common pitfall for those who think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty">True Art Is Angsty</a>, yet are wary of falling into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> (although, given the nature of the trope, they generally end up falling into it anyway). For the comedic version, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a>. Commonly experienced by those who have heard the writing advice "conflict is drama, so the more conflict, the more drama", but who don't quite get that conflict is about more than just angst. Remember... any writer who thinks happy people are boring <em>isn't trying hard enough</em>.
</p><p>Different from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> in that it's many separate and unlikely events conspiring to create angst instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, but can still overlap at times.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryLit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryLit">Misery Lit</a> has thrived on this trope since the Victorian era. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistShow">Sadist Show</a> will play it for <em>laughs</em>, and others may end up doing so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">unintentionally</a>. If the story appears to be building up to something, only to ultimately end up going nowhere or sputtering out, then it may be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a>. If, at the end of this long chain of unlikely tragedies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a> dies without accomplishing anything then you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Shoot the Shaggy Dog</a>.
</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy">Tragedy</a>.

<ul><li> The life of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">Guts</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> sucks to such a major degree that it puts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Lines</a> of Griffith and Casca to shame, especially since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">the trauma factor of the latter</a> coincides with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">the trauma of the former.</a> His life sucks so much that the universe was out to get him <em>before the dude was born</em>. He refuses to let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">the universe control his destiny</a>, but even Guts has his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">breaking point</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueGender">Blue Gender</a></em>, the universe is out to get Yuji and Marlene. This is not a supposition, it is a fact supported by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>.
</li><li> Being as it sits on the <em>very</em> far right of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em> can feel like this trope. Not only are the kids tricked into playing a deadly "game", but the one who pilots the mecha will die whether he/she wins or loses. If they lose, their universe is destroyed, but if they <em>win</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they destroy another universe and everyone in that universe will die</span>. The series seems to go out of its way to make everything as tragic and depressing as possible, as most of the children have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">tragic backstories</a> on top of having to play the "game"; for just one example, see the pilot who turns out to be pregnant, and whose baby dies along with her after her battle.
</li><li> The entire story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KoiZora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KoiZora">Koi Zora</a></em> can come off as this for the main character. Ranging from gang-rape, to an attempted suicide, then she gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">unwantedly pregnant</a> and ends up miscarrying, her boyfriend turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> so she leaves him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">her parents are getting divorced</a>... and years later, the final kicker <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with her first boyfriend turning out to have been mean to her so she'd dump him, since he's got cancer and didn't want to force her to waste her time with him... they get back together and then he dies</span>. While this <em>could</em> be seen as possible, since it's supposedly a biographical story, but some say it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a> if not flat out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie">Based on a Great Big Lie</a>.
</li><li> Yamcha of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> has a large one in the Cell Saga. His girlfriend of 15 years gets pregnant by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">sociopath</a> who oversaw his murder and his friends rub salt in the wound by asking if the baby is his. Shortly afterwards he gets impaled by a relatively weak android and realizes he'll never be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">catch up</a>. In <em>Bojack Unbound</em> it's revealed he's broke and in his last DBZ appearance he still has no one as a 50-year-old man (with his goal in life being to raising a family). His miserable lot in life is parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>'s 202nd episode. As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, things seem to have improved for the guy, with him having become a professional baseball player.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lelouch Lamperouge's mother was killed and sister crippled early on, he and said sister were sent to Japan as a pawn only for said nation to get invaded, razed and colonized by the nation he now declares corrupt, leading him to take his sister along with him into hiding. And that's just the prologue. In the series proper, fate just loves bopping him one frequently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">every time he gets a leg up</a> or in some cases <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown">just finished licking his wounds from his last misfortune</a>. Just as he finds the means to start his rebellion, his old friend from Japan has just as suddenly become one of his biggest rivals. Right after he makes a deal with his half-sister he still fondly remembered that would ease things a little, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his geass activates at the wrong moment, forcing her into a massacre which he can only stop by killing her</span>. Later his sister is kidnapped causing him to lose focus during the Black Rebellion, and as he tries to save her, he gets captured by his old friend and sold out to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Emperor</a> for a promotion, with the latter rewriting his memories sidelining him for a whole year under surveillance among other consequences. His sister ends up back in the Britannian family under threat of being used against him at any moment. Just as things are on the up and up, his best fighter is captured for a few episodes, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his fake brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">kills his would-be girlfriend</a></span>, leading him into insanity. His half-brother and worst enemy sabotages a potential truce with his best friend, indirectly leading to the destruction of Tokyo, with his sister among the dead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(apparently)</span>, and finally, Lelouch once again gets sold out to a Britannian royal, this time by his own resistance who have sided with said half-brother over some decidedly shady half truths <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later turns out to have hid his sister, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptTheCutie">also been turned against him</a></span>.

Then the king who condemned the boys to an eternity in prison stabs himself through the neck in front of Fay (Yuui) while begrudging their birth.

<ul><li> The entirety of Ryou Bakura's time onscreen is this in <em>every</em> continuity. Manga Ryou had to constantly change schools due to Yami Bakura sticking his friends into figurines, his fathers never around due to work, his mother and sister died when he was younger, he shattered his own soul to stop Yami Bakura and never defied him again afterward, he spent a lot of Duelist Kingdom being coaxed into putting the Ring back on, he spent most of Battle City injured, possessed, unconscious, or dead, he got nudged into retrieving the Ring post-Battle City and building the Shadow RPG diorama, he got excluded from the Memory World so he couldnt help there, and his other friends Bakura captured might still be stuck in their figurines. Toei Ryou was lonely as a child and just wanted friends, which the Ring gave him by trapping their souls in figurines, and he also had memory gaps, getting his hand and chest stabbed, and soul pains before Yami Bakura took over for the first time. He also had to live with the guilt of what his other self did to his friends as well as Yugi and friends. Anime Ryou almost got sent to the card graveyard to win against Bakura, couldnt get rid of the Ring since it magically came back, didnt get to go on any non-manga adapted adventures, Yami Bakura could imitate him so well it fooled everyone, the Battle City fiasco happened, and when he did fight against Yami Bakura in season 5 he ended up possessed anyway. In <em>The Darskside of Dimensions</em>, he's understandably traumatized over everything to the point of not wanting to talk about the Ring at all, but is targeted by Aigami and is nearly killed, then sent to another dimension for the last third of the movie.

Then when said daughter (then named Chie) was around ten she was effectively kidnapped (her mother and nurse were murdered out of hand) and dragged to Edo Castle where her hair was forcibly cut off, she was dressed as a boy, and she was told that her name would henceforth be Lord Iemitsu. At fourteen she was wandering the grounds when a groundskeeper took her for a catamite, tore off her clothes to discover otherwise, then raped <em>her</em>.

In Superman's case, he's living as an ordinary citizen on a Krypton that was never destroyed. However, since the plant provides a logical extrapolation of the consequences of the victim's wish, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a> applies, and in this case, life on Krypton has some serious downsides. Okay... there's probably no logical reason why a logical extrapolation of what it would be like would <em>not</em> involve Krypton having descended into social upheaval and riots, Superman's father having become a reactionary bigot, and his mother having died of cancer. But there's also no reason it would <em>have</em> to involve those things other than it being necessary for the plot. (That last one especially... is the plant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscient">The Omniscient</a> and knows that she was carrying potential cancer when she was alive in reality?)

Everyone in the cast suffers, and almost the whole cast dies. This is specially true with the title character, Jean Valjean: He spends 19 years in jail because he stole a loaf of bread (come on!!). Then after no one will even let him stay at an inn, he accidentally commits highway robbery and ends up living always on the run, even after faking his death as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">one man refuses to let it go</a>.

Fans tend to think Tobias wins at this particular kind of angst, but a careful reading of the series reveals that he has some pretty serious competition. (Consider the backstories of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_Animorphs">Auxiliary Animorphs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and how they wound up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreTeamCannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreTeamCannonFodder">being used in the end.</a> Dang.) And, in a weird way, Loren.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinJarvis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinJarvis">Robin Jarvis</a> loves doing this to his characters. For one example, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeptfordMice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeptfordMice">Deptford Mice</a></em> trilogy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Audrey's</a> father disappears and it turns out he has been murdered (she refuses to believe he is dead at first, but gradually comes to accept it), she is accused of being a witch and almost hanged <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(with the only way to save her being marriage to a friend who is not her true love)</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Piccadilly</span> (the boy mouse she is in love with) is murdered before she can confess her feelings to him, she is attacked by multiple brainwashed and violent ghosts of those she knew in life (including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Piccadilly</span> in a particularly traumatic encounter, but she is able to jog his memory and tell him she loves him; though of course it is too late to do anything about it and she witnesses his crossing over to the other side), she is forced to face the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Jupiter (the cause of the majority of her misery) head-on multiple times, and she is tricked into becoming the (at least initially) unwilling successor of the Starwife.
</li><li> It has become pretty apparent that the writer <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToLive">To Live</a></em>'s main objective is to make the protagonist suffer as much as possible, no matter how ridiculous the manner is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> — every single male parental figure in the title character's life — except Hagrid and Arthur, who was supposed to die in the middle of book five — ends up dead, one by one. (Sort of Voldemort's plan) Tip of the iceberg. Harry's whole life is epic Dickensian-level suck, from the ugly hand-me-downs to the ridiculously cruel relatives.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant">Stephen R. Donaldson</a> loves putting his characters through hell so he can watch them suffer.
</li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackStallion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackStallion">The Black Stallion</a></em> series goes for this one. Jockey Alec Ramsey, having undergone a pretty eventful life already, falls in love with a bewitching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter">free spirit</a> named Pam in <em>The Black Stallion and the Girl</em>. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">leaves him</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo">continue her wandering ways</a>, but at the beginning of the next book, <em>The Black Stallion Legend</em>, her bus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash">plunges off a cliff</a>, killing her and everyone else on board. Alec finds out about this through a newspaper account and goes quite mad. He recovers eventually. But not before he drives out into the desert with only his beloved horse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gets lost, gets found by an Indian tribe who thinks the Black is some sort of spirit horse sent to lead them to safety, which seems more reasonable when a GIANT METEOR hits the Earth, causing disaster and destruction, including massive damage to Hopeful Farm which he finds out when he decides to call home and tell them he's not dead,</span> but it does all get better in the end. Yeah, at this point, author Walter Farley was getting a bit odd. To be fair, Pam was modelled on Farley's daughter, who died in a car crash in Europe. <em>The Black Stallion Legend</em> was his way of handling it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHumor">(darkly) humorous</a> take on this.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>, arguably. Two young teens being desperately in love with each other but separated by the feuding of their families is a realistic situation, but that ridiculous farce of a dual duel misunderstanding? Tybalt tries to challenge Romeo, Romeo refuses so Mercutio fights in his place, and is killed by Tybalt, causing Romeo to kill the offender in a fit of pique. And on top of this, the Friar's messenger just conveniently fails to reach Romeo to warn him of Juliet's fake death, causing Romeo to drink poison <em>mere moments</em> before Juliet awakens, who then proceeds to stab herself with a dagger, promptly dying. So the actual tragedy of the story, the lovers' demise, could've been avoided if Romeo had waited a bloody five minutes before committing suicide, or even if the messenger had succeeded in delivering the message in the first place. The "mere moments" leads to a lovely scene in Baz Luhrmann's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WilliamShakespearesRomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WilliamShakespearesRomeoAndJuliet">William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet</a></em> when Juliet wakes up <em>right as Romeo drinks the poison,</em> and he <em>sees</em> her waking up just before the poison takes effect.

</li><li> <em>Soul of the Fire</em>, the fifth book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series is made of this. For starters, it takes place in a country where more than half the population is convinced they're inherently evil (think about if Hitler somehow managed to convince the Jews they <em>deserved</em> to be exterminated, and you'll get the idea). The one person in this group who wants to change it has his head unceremoniously broken in half. His would-be girlfriend sees her entire regiment (made up of fresh-faced girls) either slaughtered, raped, or <em>both at the same time</em> before running for her life and likely suffering the same fate. A good friend that a major character had known years ago is burned at the stake. And the hero's wife is beaten to death (but saved with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CPRCleanPrettyReliable">the kiss of life</a>) and loses their baby. Singularly the most depressing book in the whole series.
</li><li> Túrin from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChildrenOfHurin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChildrenOfHurin">The Children of Húrin</a></em>. His little sister died when he was 5. When he was 9, his father went off to war and was captured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, who cursed his entire family. (Túrin didn't know about it and thought his father died.) He then leaves his pregnant mother behind to seek shelter from the Elf king, so he wouldn't be enslaved. When he was 20, he accidentally kills an Elf who attacked him verbally and physically. Believing the king would punish him, he exiles himself. The king forgave him when he found out the truth, and let Beleg, a good friend of Túrin, search for him. Túrin joins a band of outlaws and becomes their leader. He is captured by orcs and tied up. Beleg finds him at night and cuts his bonds, but his knife slips and wakes Túrin up. Túrin jumps up and kills Beleg. Later, his mother and the sister that was born after he'd left, Niënor, go to the Elf king to look for Túrin. Obviously he's not there, so they go look for him. Glaurung the dragon puts a spell over Niënor so she forgets who she is. She goes running crazy into the woods until Túrin finds her. They fall in love and get married. Eventually Túrin goes to slay Glaurung. He fatally stabs him, but the blood makes him pass out. Niënor finds him and thinks he's dead. Glaurung tells her that she's pregnant by her brother and dies, thus lifting the spell. Niënor remembers everything and jumps off a cliff. Túrin wakes up and goes home, where he is told about Niënor from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>. He commits suicide by impaling himself on his sword which apparently talks to him.
<ul><li> Tolkien makes the subtle point that most of Túrin's troubles can be traced to his angsty self-absorption. As somebody — Beleg? — points out, other people have their problems too. Given that the War Against Morgoth is being lost, that is something of an understatement!
</li><li> This series of events is supposed to be abnormally unfortunate, as Morgoth's punishment of Húrin (Túrin's father) was to give Húrin the ability to see everything that happened to his family and then to curse said family. Considering that Morgoth helped make the world, it is to be assumed that his curses would actually come true.
</li><li> When he goes to Nargothrond with Gwindor, Gwindor's fiancée falls for him whilst he remains oblivious, and he ends up destroying Nargothrond by persuading its inhabitants to fight. Gwindor dies wishing he'd never met Túrin and Finduilas dies because Glaurung hypnotises Túrin into letting orcs drag her off.

Every time he appears to achieve or be about to achieve anything events conspire to dash his hopes and often make things much, much worse.

Despite his assertions that we live in the best of all possible worlds, Candide is kicked out of his idyllic home for kissing a girl who is apparently his cousin (although this is never brought up by any of the characters), is tricked into joining the Bulgarian army, is flogged until he has no skin on his back and begs for death, sees horrific death and destruction caused by the war, has a chamber-pot emptied on him, finds out that his beloved teacher has become a beggar hideously disfigured by syphilis, learns that his childhood home was utterly destroyed and his love interest and her family have been murdered (after brutal mass rape), and the ship he's on is beset by a storm... in the first four chapters. In fact, every character in Candide suffers from this trope—it's hard to find a character who hasn't been enslaved, raped, flogged, or lost all their worldly possessions. Interesting in that it was all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">played for laughs</a>

He gets his arm broken by his weapons trainer in an attempt to "toughen him up" (he was an aspiring musician). His one true love goes insane when his twin brother dies, plans a complicated revenge, suffers a massive breakdown, and ultimately commits suicide, but not before flooding Van with a massive torrent of magical energy that forcibly awakens all of his magical gifts. Van is left in such emotional and psychic pain that he attempts suicide twice before starting to recover.

And the mission he just flew <em>didn't</em> result in the death of Hitler as he had been told. In fact, he blew up an orphanage. And he can't go back and play football for his favorite team because the doctors had to amputate his leg. And his team lost anyway. Because their opponents' team had the nurse's husband kick the winning goals. And when he comments that such a great player must have three legs, it turns out that he does.

</li><li> Everyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em>, but Callisto in particular: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Her sociopathic/homicidal tendencies stem from witnessing her parents' deaths.</a> Upon attaining Goddess-hood she has the chance to save them via time travel... and <em>kills them in front of her younger self to ensure she becomes the person she is</em></span>.
</li><li> The modern <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> veers hard into this country, to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> has replaced gratuitous kidnapping of a companion as a source of cheap drama. See the endings of <em>Journey's End</em> and, depending on your interpretation, <em>Forest of the Dead</em> for some particularly gratuitous examples.
<ul><li> A more egregious example would be the Doctor, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">pacifist</a> being forced to fight in the biggest war ever, the Time War, having to destroy his planet and kill his entire species in order to end it. But the Daleks still manage to survive, again and again. He finds love in Rose Tyler, but she is sucked into a parallel universe, never to be seen again. He discovers another of his kind still alive - but it's the Master, who takes over the entire Earth and subjects the Doctor to ritual torture humiliation for over a year, and showing the Doctor that his precious humans are capable of cannibalising themselves, turning themselves into mutants strapped into cold metal shells, and coming back in time to murder their ancestors "because it's fun". And then when shot, the Master chooses to die rather than regenerate purely to spite the Doctor and make him suffer. In the series four finale, he is reunited with all his past companions, even Rose, but one by one they all leave him, and he even has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">wipe Donna's mind</a> of all her memories of him, right after she saved the world and gained self-confidence for the first time in her life. For a family program, the show ain't half depressing sometimes; it sometimes seems that the writers of the new series take some sort of sadistic pleasure in emotionally torturing the Doctor and are determined to break him into little pieces. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> No wonder he almost went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">completely mad</a> over the course of the 2009 specials.</span>

As an adult, he partially lost use of his left leg as a result of a blood clot and his girlfriend Stacy going behind his back to get him the procedure he didn't want. This causes a years-long addiction to Vicodin. House and Stacy broke up but when he finally reunites with her, he realizes that he can't make her leave her husband. He's shot by a random assailant in the season 2 finale, where we see House's subconscious chewing him out about refusing happiness for the sake of his job. In season 3 he finds a way to fix his leg, but it's only temporary and he's also hounded by an obsessed cop with a grudge. In season 4 and 5 he has to cope with the guilt over his involvement in the events that led to the death of his best friend Wilson's girlfriend and Wilson refusing to speak to him anymore. He nearly got brain damage while trying to save her too. In season 5 one of his colleagues commits suicide and House struggles to figure out the reason, before he starts having hallucinations, his Vicodin addiction goes out of control, and he has to be hospitalized. His attempt at a relationship with Cuddy in season 7 goes downhill because they secretly make each other miserable, Cuddy later dumps him, he's back on Vicodin, and to top it all off he's a wanted criminal when he flees the country for months after ramming a car into her home out of revenge. In season 8 he's jailed for several months before he's allowed probation if he'll practice medicine regularly. He marries a Russian emigrant to get her a green card, but when he falls in love with her for real it quickly falls apart once she figures out that he kept the confirmation of her naturalization from her out of fear that he'd lose her. Later on, Wilson tells House that he (Wilson) has stage 2 thymoma, forcing House to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ruin his career and fake his own death so he travel the country with Wilson before his best friend dies</span>.

</li><li> The Filipino drama <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EvaFonda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EvaFonda">Eva Fonda</a></em> is a quite horrific example. The show starts off its first episode with the main character being raped by one of the richest men in town. Then she goes home after the rape to find out that the love of her life <em>was sleeping with her best friend while she was being raped</em>! The show then continues with her trying to confront her rapist's father, only for him to try and rape her too! After she stabs him in self-defense and is taken to jail, one of the police officers tries to rape her during her interrogation! During her time in jail, she finds out that her sister died, and later on finds out she's pregnant with her rapist's child (which, by the way, she decides to keep and miscarries). She ends up escaping jail and living on the lam from the police and her now even-more-obsessed rapist, and the show isn't even over yet... Deus Angst Machina indeed.

<ul><li> Country music in general is frequently criticized for Deus Angst Machina. The old joke "what happens when you play country music backwards" makes light of this.
<ul><li> punchline: you get your dog back, you get your truck back, you get your house back, you get your girl back...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a>'s song "On Any Other Day" from the album <em>Reggatta de Blanc</em>: the narrator's wife has burned the scrambled eggs, the dog just bit his leg, his daughter ran away, his son has turned out gay (the song's context makes it clear that the dad doesn't mind but just resents his son's abysmal sense of timing), he slammed his fingers in his car door, his wife proudly tells him of her love affairs, and he just spilled his tea and is "covered in misery". However, the whole thing is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>. On the other hand, the really creepy, near-horror variety of this comes with "Synchronicity II", which chronicles the similarly Deus Angst Machina day of a depressed, frustrated average guy stuck in a miserable existence by contrasting it with the repeated imagery of "something crawling from the bottom of a dark Scottish lake" - the final verse can be taken as implying that he finally snapped.
</li><li> <em>You Never Even Called Me By My Name</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidAllanCoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidAllanCoe">David Allan Coe</a> has a final verse that parodies country music's tendency towards this:
<div class="indent">I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison <br/>And I went to pick her up in the rain <br/>But before I could get to the station in my pick-up truck <br/>She got ranned over by a damned old train
</div><ul><li> When writer Steve Goodman showed Coe the song and bragged that it was "the ultimate country and western song", Coe disagreed because it "hadn't said anything at all about mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or getting drunk", and proceeded to write the last verse.

First, his beloved older brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Matt</a>'s appendix bursts and he nearly dies from an infection. Then for several months he can't quite manage to get over the hump and win the WWE title, though he's coming closer than he ever has. Then he fails a Wellness test and gets suspended for two months, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a>, at which he had been rumored to win a high-profile match. While he's suspended, his house and everything he owns burns to the ground, and his cherished dog is killed in the fire as well. Then once he returns, he's set upon by a malevolent GM and still can't quite make it to winning the title. Finally, finally he wins it, but his brief run is marred by a mysterious person making repeated attempts on his life. His title run ends when his own brother turns on him in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a>, who at the time was the mortal enemy of both. Matt then reveals that not only did he do that, he was the one repeatedly trying to kill Jeff, he was the one who burned his house to the ground, and he was the one who killed Jeff's dog, and he then goes on to soundly trounce Jeff in all but the very last match of their feud. After all this, he wins the title again but loses it within a few minutes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>, who then goes on to rail at Jeff about his drug issues and keeps the title from him through many underhanded tactics. And when things are finally looking up for Jeff...he's made peace with his brother, he'd won the championship again, all was just starting to look up, bam, he loses it and his job thanks to Punk. The sad thing is, there's probably some more things that got missed in all of this. Can't blame the guy for wanting to go home and lick his wounds for a while now, can you?

The cops won't tell him outright what the problem is, just that it seems to be related to the stories he writes.

<ul><li> Lucas, the main protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em> pretty much embodies this trope, as it feels like his world was made specifically to torture him at certain points. If you list out all of the terrible things to happen to him in his short life, you pretty much have a summary of the main plot. To start with, his mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gets violently killed right in front of his eyes by what's essentially a dinosaur</span>. As a result, his father almost goes mad from the resulting grief, attacking people from the village and getting chucked into prison before he can even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> attend her funeral</span>, also all in front of Lucas and his twin, Claus. Shortly afterwards, Claus goes out to try and avenge his mother's death, and goes missing in the process. All in the span of two days. Please note that this is the first time anybody in the society he lives in has experienced grief, so nobody knows how to console or comfort him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Not done yet, though.</a> That very same day, a suspicious guy comes into Tazmily Village, telling everybody a load of waffle about "happiness" and starts peddling objects called "Happy Boxes" to everyone. These boxes essentially hypnotize the entire village, except for Lucas, who refuses to buy one. As a result, everybody in this previously close-knit and loving community slowly begin turning into selfish, hedonistic jerks. Years later, Lucas is now considered an outcast, even a disgrace, to the village. His father, still grieving over his wife, barely talks with him anymore and spends nearly all of his time searching for Claus, who is still missing. Around this time, his adventure starts. And while he does finally make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">two very good friends</a> and has his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyalAnimalCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoyalAnimalCompanion">trusty dog Boney</a> by his side as a result, his situation hardly improves. On top of having to constantly battle against horrifying, bloodthirsty creatures known as Chimeras, he now has an entire army set against him, the same army who was indirectly responsible for his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> mother's death</span> in the first place. After disabling the army's thunder tower, he finds himself in a field of sunflowers where, out of nowhere, he sees <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his mother's ghost.</span> He can't touch or communicate her, and ends up chasing her off a cliff in desperation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">It's not very clear if this is a dream or actually happening</a>. But wait, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">there's more</a></em>. Around this time, he and his friends find out about these weird objects known as the seven needles, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">which will restore the entire world either full of evil or full of good depending on who pulls them</a>. The journey to getting the seven needles leads him through countless traumatic situations, from being nearly eaten alive by a horrifying monster called the Ultimate Chimera, to accidentally sending himself on a very, <em>very</em> bad hallucinogenic drug trip that makes him face his worst fears and deep scarring, but he ultimately only manages to pull half of them. The other half are getting pulled by the commander of the army, known as the Masked Man. Once he and the Masked Man have both pulled three, Tazmily is now completely abandoned, so he has no choice but to finally go to the hub of all the corruption in his world, New Pork City. Once there, he has to live with the long-hidden truth about Tazmily: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It was all a lie. The game actually takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>, and Tazmily was set up so the last few dozen people left on Earth could live in ignorance to the world's destruction</span>. After this, the final needle is located, and he and his friends go to pull it, as it is now the world's only hope for redemption. After defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, he and the Masked Man meet in front of the final needle, ready to battle for it. As it turns out, the Masked Man is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Claus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed and with no memory of being Lucas's brother.</a></span> What follows is an absolutely heartbreaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureInThereSomewhereFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureInThereSomewhereFight">"I Know You're in There Somewhere" Fight</a>, during which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Claus</span> easily has the upper hand, and with him still showing no sign of remembering, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his mother's ghost shows up for a second time.</span> With her help, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Claus</span> very slowly realizes who he is and takes his mask off. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">He then kills himself</a>, allowing Lucas to take the needle, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight">dies in Lucas's arms</a>. And this all happens to him in the age range of 9 to 12. There's a very good reason many people consider the ending of the game to be Lucas <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> destroying the entire world out of the wangst he probably accrued throughout the game</span>, and those that don't consider him one of the strongest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">Iron Woobies</a> in any form of fiction.

Oersted is arrested for murdering the King, and the other elder hero is tortured to death as an accessory, barely able to summon enough strength to help Oersted escape. Oersted flees the kingdom, every citizen in it who once cheered him now calling him a traitor and murderer, and makes a heroic solo effort to take the Demon King down. When he finally reaches the villain... it turns out it was his old friend Straybow all along. Oersted is forced to kill his best friend, and the princess appears. A bittersweet ending? Nope. The princess tells Oersted that she believed Oersted would save her, but it was <em>Straybow</em> who saved her<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yrdr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3yrdr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yrdr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and after all that Oersted went through to try and save her, no less</span>, declares that she loves Straybow, not him, and commits suicide.

Said organisation, Cerberus, tortures and drugs her for most of her childhood, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>, in a bid to create a super-biotic. In the Cerberus facility she's forced to fight and kill other children in arena fights, being electroshocked when she refuses to, which is about the only interaction she has with other people, as she is else locked up and isolated in her room all the time. After escaping, she immediately ends up with people who abuse her for her powers and her body, only to then sell her as a slave. This starts Jack's long career of criminal activity and violence, where most people only see her as a tool to be used, while Cerberus' agents still hunt her. The only person in all the time who does care for her and loves her ends up sacrificing himself for her so she can get away after a weapons theft goes bad, giving her a massive dose of survivor's guilt as well. She eventually ends up on 'Purgatory', a prison ship from hell doubling as slave market, where she is gang-raped by a group of wardens and prisoners, and upon taking her revenge is put into constant cryostasis, as she is deemed too dangerous. She joins the game because she is bought free by Commander Shepard's financial backers — which is Cerberus. So she ends up on a Cerberus ship, with the ship's XO flat-out rejecting that the organisation made any mistakes. Said ship is heading towards a suicide mission.

Along the way, said chancellor reveals that he is Rean's biological dad. By the end of the second game, it's clear he's become so tired that he's just going through the motions. And then there's <em>Cold Steel III</em> where he decides to become a teacher, only to have two of his students not exactly his big fans; one of them comes from said city state that Rean helped take over and the other is from a noble family whose dream job was to protect the royal family, only for the chancellor to remove his family from protecting the royal family.

<ul><li> Spoofed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, in an episode of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapWithinAShow">All My Circuits</a>":
<div class="indent"><strong>Calculon</strong>: Give it to me straight, doctor. Don't sugar coat it.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Doctor</strong>: Very well. Your entire family died when a plane, piloted by your fiancee, crashed into your uninsured home... and you have inoperable cancer.
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Zoidberg</a> himself, a walking, talking, lobsteresuque version of this trope- which is the writers' intent. In one episode, for instance, his lovable pet slinky, is, how you say, de-slinked by Bender (along with several other objects in the house, and Professor Farnsworth) into a long, thin metal noodle. Zoidberg attempts to remake its coils, tentatively sends it down an ascending pile of books- then the toy promptly bursts into flames.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Frank Grimes from "Homer's Enemy" hated his life and his whole set of circumstances. Everything he tried to accomplish backfired on him, he lost out on the position at the nuclear plant he was originally selected for to <em>a dog</em>, he lived in an apartment sandwiched between two bowling alleys, and his arch-nemesis, Homer Simpson, seemed to have a better life than him (at one point, Grimes gets demoted after throwing away acid <em>that Homer was about to drink</em> and Homer gets off scot-free). Frank's hell is thought of as Heaven by Homer, but the final attempt to shame Homer for life (by having him enter a children's model building contest) imploded spectacularly when Homer <em>won</em>, and thus, he went crazy. And <em>electrocuted</em> himself. And as a final little insult, Homer fell asleep during his funeral and loudly ruined it by yelling "Change the channel, Marge!" in his sleep, to the amusement of everyone else attending. The producers later attempted to rebut criticism that they went a bit over the top torturing Grimes by claiming that it demonstrated that a 'real' person couldn't survive in the Simpsons universe, but even this explanation is a little unsatisfying considering the sheer amount of misfortunes piled on top of Grimey is <em>way</em> over the top.
</li><li> Then there's Kirk Van Houten's divorce from "A Milhouse Divided", where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">his wife is shown as inherently right</a> despite the divorce obviously coming from mutual resentment and disrespect, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity">he's fired from his job for</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeJetsonJobSecurity">being single</a></em>, and apparently got nothing out of the divorce settlement so he ends up straight in low-income housing, and it's one of the few times the show defies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> by keeping it this way. All of this just to deliver a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> to Homer about respecting his wife that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">he'll forget by the next episode</a>.
</li><li> Hans Moleman is interesting in that he is a literal example—he originated as an animation mistake that creator Matt Groening hated, but the rest of the staff loved. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of being repeatedly killed was, according to DVD commentary, a teasing attempt to placate Groening's demands that the character never be seen again.
</li><li> And then there's old Gil.
</li><li> While he offered Homer some good advice on how to handle his situation in the aforementioned "Homer's Enemy" episode (Except for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">the ol' fork-in-the-eye</a>" bit), Moe Syzlak is himself a victim of Deus Angst Machina. Every success Moe has had in life has been taken away from him somehow (getting a girlfriend, landing an acting career, etc.). In "The Seemingly Never-Ending Story" he said that fate likes to play a game called "Up yours, Moe". It's easy to see why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">later seasons portray him as suicidal</a>. And yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">he fails at suicide too</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Zuko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> spends his childhood being mentally tortured by his sadistic sister, gets a fireball thrown into his face by his own father and banished for speaking up in a war meeting and suggesting a tactic that could save the lives of more of his country's soldiers, and is constantly humiliated in his attempts to capture Aang to regain his family's respect. Eventually he's even declared a fugitive for his continued failure and has to live off the land for the first time in his life. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">Day in the Limelight</a> episode features him befriending a family of farmers and taking care of the corrupt soldiers harassing them, only for them to reject him afterwards because he revealed his identity in the process. Is it any wonder he takes to screaming at the sky, demanding to be hit by lightning? And it fails to happen?
<ul><li> His mother, the one person other than Iroh who loved him unconditionally, was banished/presumed dead when he was 11 years old because she (probably) murdered his grandfather to protect him, who in turn had ordered Ozai to murder his son as a "lesson". Ozai, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">being parent of the year,</a> said "Sure, no problem." Presuming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist">Social Services operated in the Fire Nation</a>, it seems the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">Fire Lord's Palace</a> was beyond their reach.
</li></ul></li><li> In an alternate time stream, the titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> grows up to be evil, and we mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">EVIL</a>. Why did he turn evil? When under pressure for the CAT test, Danny ends up deciding to cheat with the accidentally acquired answers. Harmless enough, but via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> and his parent's and teacher's concern (and his evil future self's intervention) he witnesses the explosive death of his family, friends, and teacher. Broken, he goes to live with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, Vlad Masters. Then, unable to bear his tortured emotions, he has his humanity torn away from his ghost half, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">goes mad with pain</a>, merges with Vlad's ghost half and murders his human half. Through the combination of Danny's evolving powers and Vlad's total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">evilness</a> he ends up destroying the world. Even disregarding what it must have felt like for Danny to be torn into his two alter egos, then turn evil/helplessly watch as his heroic side <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfulTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfulTransformation">turns evil</a>, when the time-traveling Danny sees all this... it kinda falls right in this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first scene in the series, Shiro, along with Sam and Matt Holt, is abducted off of Kerberos, one of Pluto's moons. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between this and the scene a year later, he has been enslaved, separated from his companions, experimented on, and forced to become a gladiator for the amusement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>. The entire ordeal cost him his right arm and severely traumatized him.
</li><li> After waking up from a 10,000 year cryogenic sleep, one of the first thing Allura finds out is that her entire planet was destroyed along with her entire species, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverGotToSayGoodbye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverGotToSayGoodbye">including her parents</a>. Not to mention she is never given time to mourn them properly. So...yeah...
</li><li> And then there's Keith, who grew up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveHimANormalLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveHimANormalLife">(falsely) believing his mother had willingly abandoned</a> him as an infant, lost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedParentsAreTheBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedParentsAreTheBest">his father</a> at a young age, and spent much of his childhood <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground">alone and unloved</a>. When he finally made one friend, he later received word that he had died on a space mission (see first example for what really happened). And then he got expelled from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCadetAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCadetAcademy">Space Cadet Academy</a> and lived alone in the desert for a year. As a result he is depressed at the start of the series.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a> writers absolutely <em>adore</em> this trope. It's most commonly found in romance (especially slash) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> fics; in the former it's used as a means of getting the OTP together (at best in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtComfortFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtComfortFic">Hurt/Comfort Fic</a> sort of scenario), in the latter it's used in lieu of actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> - compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticSue">Sympathetic Sue</a>.
<ul><li> This is also common in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JournalRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JournalRoleplay">Journal Roleplay</a> games, especially horror-based games.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in an Urban Legend: "Your Dog is Dead" - I've got some bad news: your dog died... from eating charred horse flesh... they died in the fire... started by the candles from the funeral... for your mother who had a heart attack... after she found your kid who drowned in the tub... because your wife slipped on the stairs and broke her neck.... [and on and on].
<ul><li> It appears in a comedy sketch, with the punchline being that the mother died from a broken heart because she found out the guy's wife was cheating on him with the groundskeeper... The guy interrupts: "Wait a minute, <em>you're</em> my groundskeeper!" Cue guy chasing storyteller off-stage.
</li></ul></li><li> The game <em>Kill Murray/Save Murray</em> features two gods, one benevolent, who wants to keep plucky everyman Murray alive, and one evil, who moves the game forward by throwing anything and everything he can think of to utterly annihilate him.
