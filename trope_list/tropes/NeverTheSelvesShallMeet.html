</p><p>This may result from attempts to apply causality to time travel: you can't meet a past version of yourself without having memory of it and the future version of yourself cannot be surprised to see past you, having had to be there to see it to make it possible. However, this can be easily avoided if you fail to recognize yourself. As a result it's generally correlated with time travel of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a> variety, and negatively correlated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loops</a> (though there are exceptions). Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe">Future Me Scares Me</a>; contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself">Screw Yourself</a>.

It's now becoming a trope in and of itself to make the reason for not meeting up not a dire end-of-the-world reason, but merely for convenience of the Master Plan.

<ul><li> Future selves take great care to conceal themselves from past selves who didn't see their own future selves. However, they also take just as much take care to <strong>reveal</strong> themselves to past selves who remember seeing or hearing their future selves. Basically, future selves act so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">their past self experiences events as their future self remembers them.</a>
</li><li> Future Asahina conceals herself from her past self on most occasions, with the explanation that her past self didn't see her future self. The one exception is when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kyon, Asahina (small) and Nagato go back to December 18th to save the world; Asahina (small) sees Asahina (big), but doesn't recognize her, and doesn't pay her much attention. There are slightly more important happenings going on, like, y'know, <em>Kyon bleeding to death in the middle of the street.</em></span>.
</li><li> In <em>The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya</em> we see Present Kyon hide so as not to reveal himself to Past Kyon from "Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody," who he remembers didn't see him; but towards the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Kyon gets stabbed, his future self arrives and tells him some words before he passes out. After he wakes up, Kyon recognizes that the voice he heard was his future self, and that when he travels back in time to that day again, he must tell those words to his past self.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is either averted or parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoctorSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoctorSlump">Doctor Slump</a></em> — it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a>, after all.
<ul><li> Averted when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor">Senbei</a> uses his Time Skipper to go back in time (three days in the past) to meet his past self in order to gain an insight on how to repair <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Arale</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dawq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0dawq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dawq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She is badly damaged at the time as the result of her battle against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Dr. Mashirito</a>'s latest robot creation.</span>

There's no inherent danger in meeting his future self, but he still does his best to keep it on the down-low to avoid weirding his future self out. Luckily, his future self is at home and never sees him.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18oy5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18oy5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18oy5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It ends on a <em>very</em> happy note for him, as it turns out Arale and Obotchaman are married in the future.</span>
</li><li> Parodied again when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Tori-bot</a> uses the selfsame Time Machine to visit Penguin Village ten years from now and find out what becomes of his future self near the end of his travel. Again, there's no inherent danger in meeting his future self on its own, but his experience bums him out when he discovers that his future self turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureLoser">panhandler begging for money at the street-side</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> video "Gather Together! Goku's World" that was released for the Terebikko, Goku meets with his younger self when the gang were time traveling. Trunks stops Goku from interacting with his younger self to prevent a paradox.
</li><li> In the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em>, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> to the thirtieth century, the titular character feels faint in the presence of her future self, Neo-Queen Serenity, and her body becomes transparent; her Silver Crystal also loses its power under the influence of its future counterpart. At the end of this story arc, Neo-Queen Serenity tries to resist the temptation of talking to her past self, since it may result in the history being changed... fails, and goes to meet Sailor Moon anyway for some seconds. The story also involved Prince Demand attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">bring the world to an end</a> by bringing together the two Silver Crystals, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is stopped by Pluto <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandStill">stopping time</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">at the cost of her own life</a>.</span> Interestingly, in <em>Stars</em> it appears that the selves <em>can</em> meet, if one of them is (supposedly) from an alternate distant future and in disguise. Possibly.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad">Kimagure Orange Road</a></em>. Touching one's past self will cause the future version to dissolve. It's never really explained exactly what happens to the future self but it gets shelved under "a bad idea to try". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It <em>almost</em> happens to Madoka in the TV series, when she befriends her younger self during an accidental trip to the past, but right when little!Madoka and big!Madoka are about to shake hands, little!Madoka's big sister calls out to her and they don't touch.</span>
</li><li> Played with quite a bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> during the Mahorafest arc. The aim is to not let the selves meet, but often the later selves run into the earlier selves, and at times, a character runs into one version of a character almost immediately after leaving another version of the character, causing confusion—especially when it happens with one of the girls <em>not</em> in on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>. Also, at one point, we distinctly see two Chamo-kuns meeting up and high-fiving. And then <em>switching places!</em> How that's supposed to work is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">mind-boggling</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsuNoArashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsuNoArashi">Natsu no Arashi!</a></em> firmly enforces this. People start to fade when they get close to their past selves, and if you meet yourself, you'll vanish entirely. Time doesn't like people having two of themselves in one place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackGod">Black God</a></em>, every person has two dopplegangers. When they meet two of the three wither away, but the third will thrive at the cost of the others.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> the past and future versions of the Vongola are not able to coexist in the same timeline.
<ul><li> Actually, at the end of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">TYL!</span> arc, we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the TYL! Vongola guardians are being kept in some weird capsule thingy but do see/talk to their past selves.</span> Although they were admittedly in what could have been a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> separate pocket dimension created by the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> 's men</span>.
</li><li> An attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defy</a> this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">gone horribly wrong</a> resulted in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ghost, who was a version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Byakuran</a> from an alternate timeline that was brought over to the main timeline. In the process, Ghost's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">parallel world</a> was destroyed, and Ghost himself was left as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyAbsorption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyAbsorption">Flame-absorbing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> with hardly anything resembling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">human consciousness</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OccultAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OccultAcademy">Occult Academy</a></em> goes for the worst possible variation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fumiaki meeting his past self overloads the timeline and causes the apocalypse. Though he does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> and prevents the thing he caused.</span>

A memorable use of this concept occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheManOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheManOfTomorrow">Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?</a></em>, when a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> has traveled to the story's present (which is shortly after her death in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>), and casually asks her cousin why this <em>hasn't</em> happened.

</div></li><li> In most Silver-age Superman stories, if the Man of Steel travels to a time, past or future, where he exists, that other version gets tossed back to the "empty slot" he started from. This normally occurs in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy">Superboy</a> stories, so that Superman ends up wandering the Smallville of his youth.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a>: Legion of 3 Worlds</em> miniseries, Superboy-Prime punches his future self, causing both selves to dematerialize and disappear.
</li><li> In <em>Final Crisis: Superman Beyond</em> it was claimed that Superman and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> counterpart, Ultraman, can't touch each other without causing an explosion that would destroy them both. Except in Limbo, where the rules are different. (Never mind that they've fought each other lots of times and that's never happened before.)
</li><li> Also, the first time Post-Crisis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> met <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a>, shaking her hand caused Power Girl to suddenly go berserk and attack everyone. This was attributed to them being alternate universe counterparts and it making reality glitch out for a moment or something, but it hasn't happened since.
</li><li> In the New 52 Supergirl issue #19, Supergirl and Power Girl meet up again with very different results, providing both a discussion/lampshading and subversion of this trope. It turns out Power Girl knew about the main DC Earth's version of Supergirl but didn't dare because she didn't want "the universe to explode if we touch." (What actually happens when they <em>do</em> touch is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they exchange memories.</span>)
</li><li> Although Waverider of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Armageddon2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Armageddon2001">Armageddon 2001</a></em> had encountered his younger self as Matthew Ryder in 1991 without any problems, realizing from this that he was the superhero he met as a child who rescued him, he was tempted to make himself fully known to both his younger self and his parents in the <em>Superman</em> story "Time And Time Again Again", but he didn't because he realized that would disrupt events in the space-time continuum. He did, however, meet with his alternate timeline self as the leader of the Linear Men, which at first turned out to be disastrous since when Waverider killed the other Matthew Ryder, he trapped himself, Superman, and the Linear Men in a Nullsphere, unable to leave until Waverider used Hunter's energy beam to alter time so that the other Matthew Ryder was never killed in the first place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em>, it becomes Never the Earths Shall Meet, as when the universes of Earths-1 and 2 are shunted into the Netherverse, they start slowly merging with each other, with the Monitor explaining that if they should occupy the same space together, they will annihilate each other. The result of this merging is that all time becomes one, creating a "warp zone" between the Earths where all of Earth's history is mixed together in a strange hodgepodge. The universes of Earths-4, S, and X also share the same problem, although the heroes realize that it is the Anti-Monitor that is causing the universes to merge together toward the end of mutual annihilation. It isn't until after the battle with the Anti-Monitor at the dawn of time that the multiple universes are safely merged together and rebooted as a single universe.
</li><li> In <em>Timecop</em>, you can meet yourself and even talk to yourself, as long as you do not <em>touch</em>, because "the same matter can't occupy the same space at the same time". When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> does (with the hero's "help"), both selves melt and are erased from time.

Oddly, this is not a problem when <em>he</em> meets his younger self.
<ul><li> Major Vance Astro, in fact, sought out the younger Vance Astrovik to explicitly tell his younger self not to become an astronaut, thus avoiding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> of the Major's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a>.

Of course, seeing as the reason he was seeing this was because the fabric of reality was <em>already</em> in jeopardy because of Dormammu's plot to bring about the apocalypse, it's likely these two encounters couldn't have done any further damage.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>. Probably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> in film, despite the trope being less a hard and fast rule and more of a general guideline.
<ul><li> In the movies, nothing worse than fainting happens, and both Doc and Biff seem able to avoid even that by averting their eyes from themselves, or maybe just by being prepared for it. It seems that young Biff in the '50s had no basis to suspect that the "crazy old codger" was himself. It's also entirely possible that the "destroy the universe by temporal paradox" hypothesis was just that — a hypothesis, and there never was any real danger at all. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">The two Bobs</a> explain that Doc's concern is that the recognition of a past character meeting his or her future self could lead to an event that causes the paradox; for example, while the two Jennifers simply passed out when meeting each other, the producers explain that had "young" Jennifer fallen, hit her head and sustained a fatal injury she would not have had a future self to trigger the incident, resulting in a paradox.
</li><li> Likewise, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackToTheFutureTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackToTheFutureTheGame">2011 video game</a>, the beginning of Episode 2 requires Marty to retrace his steps and keep his grandfather from getting killed while trying not to run into himself from a few hours ago (during the events of Episode 1). To make things even more confusing, the end of the final episode of the game has Marty arguing with Marty and Marty over which timeline is correct, while a confused Marty looks on. And yet Doc still says, while all of these Martys are having their little discussion, that them meeting each other could destroy the space-time continuum. Still seems fine at the moment.
</li><li> In LJN's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackToTheFuturePartIIAndIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackToTheFuturePartIIAndIII">Back to the Future Part II &amp; III</a></em> game for the NES, though, as you leave behind temporal clones of yourself every time you leave and then revisit one of the three time periods (1955, 1985, and 2015) in the <em>Part II</em> section, collision with your temporal copies causes you to lose a life.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Two time-travel-created copies of the same person shake hands with each other, setting off the end of the universe.</span>
</li><li> Boxer Santaros avoids this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as someone has already taken the care to murder his double. Or perhaps the original.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer">Primer</a></em>: when the protagonists start time traveling, they take elaborate precautions to avoid meeting themselves, but it becomes progressively more clear that (aside from creating permanent duplicates of themselves) these precautions are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">totally unnecessary</a>. By the end of the movie, Aaron has drugged his past self's breakfast and stowed him in the attic, and is then promptly attacked by yet another, future, version of himself.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DejaVu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DejaVu">Déjà Vu</a></em> took care to avoid potential paradoxes like this in an unwritten way by ensuring that the Denzel who traveled back in time died without ever meeting his younger self.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostHighway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostHighway">Lost Highway</a></em>, Fred Madison buzzes himself on the intercom to tell himself, "Dick Laurent is dead." A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch">David Lynch</a> film, of course, this is open to interpretation.

When one character asks why they couldn't bring one of the Japanese WWII veterans they knew with them, since they'd know where the dinosaur would be, the Futurians who had the time machine explain that if the same person was in the same point in time twice, it would cause a paradox that would cause one or both of the person in question to be wiped from existence.
</li><li> Played straight to gruesome effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timecop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timecop">Timecop</a></em>. Physical contact with your other self leads to... well, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">not pleasant</a>. As mentioned in the comic book entry, this is specifically due to the same <em>matter</em> occupying the same space; as long as they didn't touch, meeting was fine.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timecop2TheBerlinDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Timecop2TheBerlinDecision">Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision</a></em>: Meeting up with your past self in this movie does not cause the person in question to melt out of existence, but results in them fusing into straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>.

Lucky for him, they manage to drag him away before it becomes permanent. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jessie has this happen to her completely near the end of the film, forcing David to go back to the beginning in an attempt to correct for all of it</span>.

</li><li> Referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, but averted. When Scott Lang suggests building a time machine, the others becomes exasperated when it becomes clear that Scott is getting all his ideas about how time travel works from movies, including never meeting their past selves. The smarter heads explain that time travel works on multiverse theory, meaning that nothing bad happens when Captain America and Nebula encounter their past selves save for it leading to them fighting; that said, they still have to avoid causing any massive changes, not for their own timeline's sake but in order to keep from screwing up the other timelines they visit.
</li><li> In the sci-fi short <em>Hyperlight</em>, an FTL accident causes two versions of the same spaceship to collide. The female pilot retrieves her co-pilot (and lover) who registers as alive but has no vital signs, and boards the second spaceship to find the co-pilot alive and herself dead.

<ul><li> In Larry Maddock's <em>Agent From T.E.R.R.A.</em> series about time traveling cops trying to defeat a rogue time traveling agent turned conqueror, this is explicit. Why is never explained, but at least once per book the plot hinges on one or more people being prohibited from entering a certain period of time (minutes to hours) because they were then (sic) already. One very nice feature of this series is that several times the main character will race toward his time machine, immediately phase out of the time stream, and then relax: going to bed, taking care of wounds, preparing and eating a hearty meal, etc. He reflects that he could spend literally years preparing to go back to the precise micro-second he left, so now there is no hurry at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllOurYesterdays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllOurYesterdays">All Our Yesterdays</a></em>, it's claimed that if past selves see their future selves, both will be erased from existence, but it's a lie intended to stall them.
</li><li> Addressed in book six of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> series, appropriately titled <em>The Time Paradox</em>. Meeting one's past self is warned against, but for pure caution's sake — never before <em>have</em> the selves met, so nobody can say for sure it <em>wouldn't</em> destroy the universe. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ends up subverted — Artemis meets himself, does battle with himself several times (and Butler, who's arguably the more dangerous of the two), and eventually the two Artemises collaborate to bring down Opal Koboi. The timeline seems harmed not at all, and there's evidence that it actually resulted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> leading to the events of the first book.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfTheNewSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfTheNewSun">The Book of the New Sun</a></em>, Severian feels absolutely certain that if he accidentally met himself while time traveling, one or both of them would go mad and kill the other.
<ul><li> In the sequel <em>The Urth of the New Sun</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Severian dies but some equally real duplicates of him are created. When one of them meets Severian through time travel, the duplicate explodes</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em> novels, time-travel is generally exhausting, but is substantially more so when traveling near oneself. This one's also an example in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> world.
<ul><li> Note that <em>both</em> selves will feel the effects. If you suddenly feel dizzy and weak for no reason, it might mean that future-you is in the vicinity.
</li><li> In <em>Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern</em>, to stop a plague, Moreta and her dragon repeatedly loop back over the same time period. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though her appearances are in many different locations, the repeated trips prove lethal.</span>
</li><li> The most recent books imply that this problem is exclusive to dragonriders, and is the result of their telepathic bond with their dragon inadvertently becoming duplicated as a result of the time travel.
</li><li> This reaction is the reason Lessa survived Fax's attack on Ruatha Hold. When adult Lessa unwittingly traveled to the morning of the attack, child Lessa was awoken by the feeling of unease brought about by her adult self's presence and instinctively hid in the watch-wher's kennel.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEndOfEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEndOfEternity">The End of Eternity</a></em>, there are time periods in regular time allocated for an Eternal to use, and naturally, you are not to use them twice. However, when the protagonist goes into regular time illegally, he doesn't keep track as well, so he <em>almost</em> meets himself (that is, he catches a glimpse of his past self). There don't seem to be any consequences, but he is extremely and irrationally terrified.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FortunatelyTheMilk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FortunatelyTheMilk">Fortunately, the Milk</a></em>, the time-traveling protagonist is repeatedly warned of the potentially disastrous consequences if the same object from two different points in time touches itself; nobody's entirely sure what the consequences would be, exactly, but the leading theory is that it would cause the destruction of the entire universe. Inevitably, the climax of the story features an encounter between two versions of the same object, with dramatic — and entirely unexpected — consequences.
</li><li> One of the most important rules of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>? Don't be seen by yourself. You could panic and kill your past or future self. Notable for not really being a result of time travel so much as just being a duplicate. Though not spelled out explicitly in the books, this could have something to do with the existence of Polyjuice Potion — in most non-time-travel related situations where you notice a duplicate of yourself, it means someone's up to no good. As Harry's own experience with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>, which was the only one the readers were able to follow, turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>, the killing-your-past-self thing is unlikely to ever happen.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeTheUniverseAndEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LifeTheUniverseAndEverything">Life, the Universe and Everything</a></em>; Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent arrive on Earth shortly before its destruction. Ford (who had, in the previous novel, explained to Arthur that history cannot be changed because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">it all fits together like a jigsaw</a>), warns Arthur against phoning to warn himself. Not because it'll do anything to the timestream, but just because it won't work. It had already been noted in <em>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</em> that no matter how many times you visit the restaurant in the title, which you would always do in the universe's last half-hour or so, you are guaranteed to never run into yourself "because of the embarrassment this usually causes," despite this being impossible. How the people responsible for the restaurant's operation pull this off is not explained, but it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> magnificently along with other things about Milliways by the Guide's repeated use of the phrase "This is, of course, impossible", and the restaurant's advertising slogan: "If you've done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">six impossible things</a> today already, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe?"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyAndTheBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyAndTheBomb">Johnny and the Bomb</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>, the time-trolley sends Johnny forward in time just before his past self sees him, apparently to avoid paradox. It's still enough to shake the time travelling Johnny: "I saw the back of my own head! No-one's done that since the Spanish Inquisition!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones">Diana Wynne Jones</a>' novels often involve alternate universes and occasionally also time travel, which means they touch on this from time to time:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASuddenWildMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASuddenWildMagic">A Sudden Wild Magic</a></em> has an example similar to the <em>Stargate</em> one below — travel into alternate universes is possible, but causes instant death for anyone with a counterpart in that universe.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharmedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharmedLife">Charmed Life</a></em>, the character who manages to travel into an alternate universe does so via a method which cyclically displaces all her alternate selves, so every universe that had a version of her continues to do so. In fact, the main qualification for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Chrestomanci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Chrestomanci">Chrestomanci</a>, the enchanter who keeps all the other magic users in line, is that he have nine lives. This makes it possible for him to go to other universes comparatively easily: he has the extra lives because the alternate selves who would otherwise have them don't exist.
</li><li> But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATaleOfTimeCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATaleOfTimeCity">A Tale of Time City</a></em>, Vivian, Jonathan and Sam manage to be on the same railway platform in <em>three different incarnations</em> at the same moment and nothing happens - although they're careful not to be seen, it's just in case they change history. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">More than they already have, anyway.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Hinted to normally be the case for the Eternal Champion in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock">Michael Moorcock</a>'s related stories. Different incarnations do meet each other and even team up from time to time under suitably unusual circumstances, but once the emergency allowing for the encounter passes they inevitably have to part ways again shortly thereafter (sometimes downright abruptly) to avoid putting too much unspecified strain on the multiverse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRifter">The Rifter</a></em>: Averted. When Kahlil arrives in a Basawar where history was changed, the version of himself in the new time is already dead. He does have two sets of memories coexisting confusingly in his head, though. Eventually, he finds the bones of his other self and they merge into his body; at the same time, he feels like his two histories have become truly integrated into one personality.
</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RIsForRocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RIsForRocket">R Is For Rocket</a></em> stories, a man participating in a time-travel safari has this explained to him. The 'bump' they felt just before arrival was the time machine leaving at the end of the safari, the tour guide explains that "Nature doesn't allow that kind of thing- man meeting himself".
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SonicTheHedgehogInTheFourthDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SonicTheHedgehogInTheFourthDimension">Sonic the Hedgehog in the Fourth Dimension</a></em>, older and younger selves could co-exist, but not touch: if they did, they melted together somewhat painfully to become one self. Sonic did this ("Now I'm twice as cool"). He also did this with the evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">anti-Sonic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">Cinos</a>, causing some alarm as to whether good or evil would win out in the resulting Sonic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Good won.</span> Imaginary creatures <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheirOwnImage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheirOwnImage">threatening to rewrite history</a> kept people from asking too many questions. Still, at the end, it was two positive Sonics plus one negative Cinos, which should equal one positive Sonic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Last Command</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a> has a variant of this trope, involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">clones</a> instead of time travel. Clones grown near others set up "resonance effects" in the Force, which can drive them insane, and when Luke encounters his clone, he finds the experience incredibly off-putting: there's a buzzing hum in the Force that makes it hard to concentrate or think, making it difficult to fight the clone. This only seems to affect clones whose growth has been accelerated to an extreme degree — having them grow up in under a year, for instance — and Force-sensitive clones, since the clone army in the prequels (who take about 10 years to grow up) doesn't have any problems with this. Thrawn figures out a way around it in the same novel, using lizards that can push away the Force to protect against the clone madness <em>and</em> dramatically decrease the time to grow them even further.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeScout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeScout">Time Scout</a></em> series, which already presents time travel as potentially dangerous if you don't get the small details right, also avoids the meet-yourself problem by making it clear that you must never go back to a time when you already exist, either by having been born by then, or having previously visited via time travel; otherwise, since you can't be in two places at once, the "current" you who went back in time would simply wink out of existence the instant you arrived, and that's the end of you.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> time-traveling trilogy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheAncients">The War of the Ancients</a></em>, the character Krasus (a dragon shapeshifted into an elf) is unable to transform into his dragon form because he already exists, as his younger counterpart Korialstraz. Likewise, Korialstraz is unable to transform into anything else. The two are weaker the farther apart they are, but become stronger when they're close. The two work around this problem somewhat by giving each other one of their scales.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConnieWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConnieWillis">Connie Willis</a>' time-travel books, you simply <em>can't</em> go back to a time you've already visited. If you try it—or if your presence, for any reason, would cause a paradox of some sort—either the "net" (via which one time-travels) simply won't open, or it will deposit you slightly awry (in time and/or space) of your intended destination. Cosmic Censorship may be at work here: if you cause a paradox, then the next version of you is sent to a slightly different point (or the machine fails), repeat until there's no paradox.
</li><li> A non-time-travel variant in the <em>13th Reality</em> books. If you meet your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">Alternate Self</a> from another reality, one of you will spontaneously cease to exist (which one is apparently completely random).

</li><li> In <em>Crime Traveller</em> this is one of the rules of time travel.

<ul><li> Like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>, this winds up less of a cosmic rule and more of a guideline to prevent paradoxes, since the timeline is <em>very</em> malleable (case in point, the time he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">left a digital camera in the 1980s, which subsequently retconned his own son out of existance</span>).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> <em>I'm Born!!</em> zig-zags this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> Ryotaro goes back in time and meets himself as a child, the shock of which causes both to faint.

<ul><li> On the other hand, the film's climax has Yuuto revealing that he "borrowed" Ryotaro from three other points in the timeline (using a powerful sedative to knock them out), which allows all four Den-O Imagin to exist at the same time and help fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Gaoh and his minions.

In this case the Legends, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">out of options</a>, break the fundamental rule of time travel and double back on their own timeline. Despite initially trying to avoid interacting with their past selves, they eventually do. The two versions of Rip upon seeing each other have just enough time to say (in unison) "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh bollocks!</a>" before there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash">Time Crash</a>.
</li><li> The rule here is that while you can meet a version of yourself in your own natural timeline, like Stein's younger self, you can't meet through time travel a version of yourself that is ALSO time traveling to that same spot because that can cause timequakes. This basically makes sure the Legends can't get infinite do overs by just traveling back 5 minutes to try again, because they'd see their other selves. Though they get around this in the first season finale by having Sara and Firestorm travel to the point in the first episode where the whole team first took on Savage, by making sure they remain far in the distance where the Legends can't see them. Notably they had to hide at one point so the other Firestorm didn't see them when he was flying by.

The scientist shields one of two identical bunnies from the other and shouts, "Don't let them near each other!" The series proper averts the trope, though.
</li><li> In the many time-traveling episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OddSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OddSquad">Odd Squad</a></em>, a rule is stated that if your other self sees you, it will cause a "Timetastrophe," which causes time to fold in on itself. The Timetastophe has three phases: First, there are the timequakes. Then, the opening of time holes let in a 1920s businessman, a viking, and a gogo dancer. Lastly, the worst of all, the time sheep appear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> does this too, at the end of series 6. The crew's future selves travel back in time to meet them as they are at that point for some repairs. Kryten admonishes the crew to not contact the future Dwarfers to avoid gaining inappropriate knowledge of the future. They watch instead, and despise what they became. The result? 'I say we fight. ... Better dead than smeg.' From the snivelling, whining coward (according to everyone, including himself) Rimmer.

Annie is able to meet herself from a parallel universe without consequence, but only one of them is supposed to exist in that dimension, so they're unstable. When they touch each other, Parallel Annie is destroyed.

You can survive for short periods, and are exempt if your counterpart is dead, which saves Daniel in one episode, Kowalsky in a second, and Carter in a <em>third</em>. Time travel, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have this effect in any way.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em> episode "The Alternative Factor" involves two identical men named Lazarus. One is from our universe and insane. The other is from an anti-matter universe. Apparently, if both meet in the same universe, it destroys both of them. No explanation was given why the anti-matter Lazarus didn't blow up upon contact with any matter from our universe. The episode ends in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> moment where Kirk traps the two between universes, so they can fight it out for eternity. Apparently no one thought of killing or imprisoning the insane one.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Timecop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Timecop">Timecop</a></em> episode has a retired cop from the future use the time machine to try to recover the loot from a criminal he once caught. He ends up taking his past wife hostage, causing his past self to start to approach him. The future cop warns him of the consequences (see the Film section), but the past self is willing to let both of them be disintegrated to protect his wife. This doesn't happen, though.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Timeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Timeless">Timeless</a></em>, it's stated that time traveling to a period when you already exist can be extremely hazardous to your health. Apparently, it wasn't pretty for the test pilot, who attempted that. This counts both for one's own lifespan (i.e. can't go to a time after you're born) and one's trips into the past (can't revisit the same time). In Season 2, Flynn reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucy from 2023 visited him 2 weeks after his family's murder to give him her diary, violating this rule.

Any attempt to travel to a time period you already occupied put you into a "Loop Trap" — you'd basically be "stuck" reliving the time covered by the loop over and over. Of course, you wouldn't realize this, because it would be the first time through every time. Better hope one of your teammates is willing to pull you out of the loop. <em>Timetricks</em>, a Timemaster supplement meant for more experienced groups, included a little gadget that would let you bypass a Loop Trap for a short period of time, assuming it worked.

Interacting with your younger self is relatively safe compared to all the other stupid things you can do during a time-travel jaunt. However, going back in time to the same moment twice and coming into contact with your own time-traveling self is an excellent way to drive yourself all sorts of crazy — when the game describes an act as "about the stupidest thing you can do without a death ray and a bottle of tequila," you <em>know</em> it's a bad idea.

Remember to respect your elders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has rules in place to partially enforce the alternate-universes version of this, although whether the time-travel version is also enforced depends on whether you're a legendary creature or a planeswalker:
<ul><li> The "legend rule" applies to legendary creatures (or legendary permanents of any type). Legendary permanents represent unique, named characters, places, or objects rather than generic ones; originally, the legend rule stated that if a legendary permanent entering the battlefield shares a name with one already on the battlefield, both are sent to the graveyard. However, two legendary permanent cards could represent the same character without sharing a name. For example, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=106398">Kamahl, Pit Fighter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220490">Kamahl, Fist of Krosa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> represent the same character but have different names, so they could coexist on the battlefield. The rule was later amended to be a softer version of this, with multiple copies of a legendary permanent being allowed to exist as long as they are on different sides of the battlefield; If one player ends up with two or more copies of the same legendary card in play, they must sacrifice all but one as soon as they enter the battlefield.
</li><li> The planeswalker card type had a similar rule to the legend rule, only it refers to a planeswalker's subtype; if a planeswalker entering the battlefield shares a subtype with one already on the battlefield, both are sent to the graveyard. This is because there are no generic planeswalker cards; each represents a specific character, and the subtype indicates which character is represented. This means that two planeswalker cards that represent the same character without being the same card still destroy each other. For example, a popular strategy to combat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">one-time</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=195297">Jace, the Mind Sculptor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was to either remove him by casting his less-expensive version <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205960">Jace Beleren<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or use the fact that Jace Beleren is less expensive to put him into play before a Mind Sculptor is cast at all, meaning the other player would have to waste a Mind Sculptor card in order to clear the way for another one. Since both represent the same character (in game terms, since both are Planeswalker - Jace), they destroy each other by being in play at the same time. Like above, this rule was changed, being removed completely and instead making all Planeswalkers have the legendary type, and it's associated restrictions, as a rule.

One could argue the very act of meeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">another version of yourself</a> causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">your own future to change</a> (while leaving his present/past intact, as for him, it already happened).
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuzzLightyearOfStarCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuzzLightyearOfStarCommand">Buzz Lightyear of Star Command</a></em> has the heroes encounter their alternates from another dimension (where the biggest difference was that Buzz himself was evil). XR warns the team to avoid touching their counterparts — just as the two Boosters greet each other with a hug. When nothing happens, XR remarks on the trope not applying.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> movie <em>Bender's Big Score</em>, we learn that duplicates of persons or objects created by time travel are automatically doomed, as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">Equivalent Exchange</a>. This becomes a plot point as we learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leela's new fiancee is another version of Fry, and calls off the wedding rather than subject Leela to the grief caused by his ultimate demise. And sure enough, he dies at the end in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.</span> At the very end, hundreds of Bender duplicates appear and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as they explode one by one, the sheer volume of temporal anomalies leads to a rupture in the universe - and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> for the next movie.</span> This is <em>almost</em> a subversion as until time corrects the paradox by destroying the duplicate, duplicates are free to touch and interact with each other.
<div class="indent"><strong>Scammer Alien:</strong> I met my past self in a bar for a drink, one thing led to another, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself">we ended up back at my place</a>. Or should I say, "our" place. (passionately embraces duplicate) <br/><strong>Everyone Else:</strong> Ewwwww!!! <br/><strong>Scammer Alien:</strong> Oh come on, you prudes!
</div></li><li> In the season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em>, the Warden goes back in time to his own trial to save himself, and by the simple act of hugging his past self, causes the very fabric of reality to completely and utterly fall apart.
<div class="indent"> <em>"Stop touching yourself!"</em>
</div><ul><li> Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies</a> - which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">pretty much the standard</a> for any given episode.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar">The Penguins of Madagascar</a></em>, Kowalski invents a time machine, but a future Kowalski has come to get Private to stop him, warning him that if both Kowalskis were to ever meet, it would cause a rip in the space-time continuum. Also, a <em>third</em> Kowalski has come to get Skipper to keep the time machine from being destroyed. When the two future Kowaslkis meet, they reassure the others that it's okay, as long as the <em>original</em> Kowalski doesn't see them. And that's when original Kowalski sees them, causing the space-time rupture that led them all here in the first place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TazMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TazMania">Taz-Mania</a></em>, Marvin the Martian's team-up with Taz. For whatever reason, hooking Taz up to some big gyroscope thing allows him to spin them through time. Marvin is always cautioning him not to meet himself, as "It results in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a>." Of course, he forgets this advice. The result was somewhat similar to the ending of that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> episode where Buster, Hamton and Plucky drank beer.
</li><li> Another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> short has a humorous non-time travel invocation of the trope. Playing hide and seek with Prissy's little "egghead" son, Foghorn Leghorn hides in a storage bin. The young genius plays with a slide rule, scribbles down some calculations, marks an "X" on the ground, and proceeds to extract Foggy from that very spot with a shovel. Foghorn protests, but the little Einstein just points to his calculations. As the scene ends, Foggy passes the bin in which he had hidden, and starts to curiously lift the lid, but stops himself.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Foghorn:</strong> No, I'd better not look. I just <em>might</em> be in there!
</div></li><li> In the DCAU, specifically in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>, this is the explanation used by the future Vandal Savage for why he doesn't go to the past and stop himself from destroying the world in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/JusticeLeagueS2E19And20Hereafter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/JusticeLeagueS2E19And20Hereafter">Hereafter</a>; considering that Vandal Savage is an immortal caveman who has lived out virtually all of human history, that means he effectively can't time travel at all. He specifically says that it's a result of his particular time machine's design rather than an immutable law of the universe. In fact, Batman travels to the future and meets the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> version of himself in a later episode, with no consequences. Admittedly, time outright <em>collapsed</em> in that episode, so "no consequences" is a bit of a relative term. In the short term, at least, it turned out fine, and the collapse was caused by Chronos messing too much with time, not by the Bat-selves meeting.
<ul><li> For the same reason, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/JusticeLeagueS1E24To26TheSavageTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/JusticeLeagueS1E24To26TheSavageTime">The Savage Time</a> the present Vandal Savage was unable to go back in time to take over the world. Instead he sent back a laptop informing his past self how to do so.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> version of Batman had no recollection of his younger self's perspective of their meeting or the events that led to the meeting. That said, the timestream was <em>already</em> pretty much in flux by that point for unrelated reasons.
</li><li> Static traveled to <em>Batman Beyond</em> and briefly met his future self. No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a>, and his future self didn't seem the least bit surprised.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BumpInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BumpInTheNight">Bump in the Night</a></em>: Mr. Bumpy unwittingly insulted Squishington, who locked himself away as a result of it. Bumpy then went back in time to prevent that but failed. Then he went back <em>again</em> and failed <em>again</em>. The three Bumpys then got an advice from Future Squishington and apologized to their friend. When Squishington asked the Bumpys why there were three of them, they disintegrated because they couldn't agree on which ones had to leave.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FantasticFourWorldsGreatestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FantasticFourWorldsGreatestHeroes">Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FantasticFourWorldsGreatestHeroesOutOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FantasticFourWorldsGreatestHeroesOutOfTime">Out Of Time</a>", HERBIE frantically reminds Susan, Ben, and Johnny of this rule, alleging that "the universe could implode!... or something" if it's not followed.

She failed but claimed she remembered that meeting from her past self's point of view and stated the past couldn't be changed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em> received a visit from their future selves with a plan to go to the future (a future ruled by cockroaches) to steal a kit to take over the world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Not only did the plan fail, as usual</a>, but they ended with several Pinkys and several The Brains.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>: In "A Sitch in Time", when Kim defeated Drakken, Killigan and Monkey Fist, Shego got a visit from her future self, who advised her to steal the time monkey and use it to take over the world. Past Shego first assumed Drakken cloned her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries">Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</a></em>: Jumba invented a time machine and installed a paradox inhibitor to prevent its users from meeting past selves. The users would basically rewind time. Lilo and Stitch once forgot to use the inhibitor and met their past selves but no disaster seems to have happened from it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em> had three episodes of this instance:
<ul><li> "Father Time" had Timmy and his fairies travel back to the 1970's. Timmy found out a young Bill Gates was Cosmo and Wanda's godchild. Cosmo and Wanda met their past selves but nothing bad happened from it. When he was back in present time, a future Timmy showed up with <em>his</em> Cosmo and Wanda, destroyed the remains of a trophy and told present Timmy he'd thank him for it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">One can only wonder why</a>.
</li><li> "The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker" had Timmy and his fairies going back to 1972 and Timmy found out Cosmo and Wanda were Crocker's fairy godparents back then. It's unknown if past Cosmo and Wanda recognized their present selves, but past Jorgen recognized present Jorgen.
</li><li> "Channel Chasers": Coming from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>, an adult Timmy went back to his childhood to prevent Vicky from taking over the world.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> episode "No Time For Smurfs", Handy accidentally creates temporal copies of himself, Brainy, Clumsy, and Smurfette when they mess around with Father Time's Sands Of Time hourglass by first causing time to go backwards and then causing time to repeat previous events such as their discovery of Father Time's workshop. Averted in that nothing disastrous happens, but the temporal copies do inform Papa Smurf that they have seen what they think are copies of themselves in a cave. Fortunately, by the end of the episode, Father Time and Mother Nature straighten the whole mess out, and the temporal copies vanish.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder">Chowder</a></em>, Mung Daal and Chowder travel back in time to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">correct a cooking mistake Mung made as an apprentice</a>, where Mung insists that they <em>not</em> interact with his past self to avoid space-time from unraveling. Naturally, Chowder doesn't listen and brings Mung's past self back to the future with them, wiping out their entire universe (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">not that it sticks</a>).
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em>, where the three Spies are jaunted twenty-years into the future, and can interact with their adult selves safely, and good thing too, because they have to <em>rescue</em> them from the now-villainous Mandy.
<ul><li> Played more straight, and probably invoked in an episode where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> is used for the villain to manipulate Jerry in the 70's into committing robberies through time and ultimately change history. In the climax, he gets the idea to have the Spies travel further back before he can meet with the villain, and bring him into the other timeline. The two selves making contact results in a paradox that restores everything back to normal.
</li></ul></li><li> This Trope is <em>defied</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> movie <em>Ego Trip</em>, where the Dexter everyone's familiar with uses his time machine to form a team consisting of himself and his Teenage, Adult, and Elderly selves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>, courtesy of Mandark's tampering. There was no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a>, <em>despite</em> the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mandark used the same trick to fight them. In fact, after Dee Dee intervenes, she accidentally crates a future utopia.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em> episode "Operation: F.U.T.U.R.E.", this is Zigzagged. The villain was apparently able to create the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> not only by doing this <em>intentionally</em>, but by keeping in regular contact with her future self. On the other hand, Numbuh Four's future self did speak to him after giving the rest of the team vital information needed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>, but he never told them who he was. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And given what is revealed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a>, it would seem that this future timeline is undone completely, and Numbuh Four's future is changed.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em>: In "Blast to the Past", Sonic and Sally travel back in time and meet their past selves. Nothing bad happens from this and the past selves don't know who they really are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> referenced this in one episode, where Dale mistakes one of Kahn's relatives for a time traveler (due to his high-tech car, and thinking that the military time clock was showing the year) and thinks that he was sent one day in the past. He believes that seeing his past self will cause the planet to explode since space-time wouldn't comprehend it. So he spends the day doing things that he doesn't like to supposedly lower the chance of seeing his other self, before coming to the conclusion that he'll run into himself in his bathroom since he refuses to use any other than his own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PennZeroPartTimeHero">Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero</a></em>: In "Back to the Past of Future Balls", all characters who go back in time wear disguises to avoid being recognized by their past selves. The good guys wear fake mustaches and the bad ones wear fake beards.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em> worlds, having two of the same individual in the same dimension will eventually result in a universe-destroying paradox. This was first discovered in "Two Good To Be True" as a result of two versions of Knuckles hanging around. Later, in "Where Have All The Sonics Gone?", Morpho made sure to send their Sonic to a dimension where there were no other Sonics to avoid this happening. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later, when Shadow decides to "to heck with everything" in "Eggman: The Video Game", he intentionally takes Eggman and his Lord Eggman counterpart prisoner in order to create an anomaly</span>.
</li><li> Hilariously averted in the episode <em>The Last Christmas</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a>, where Scrooge greets his past self in a Christmas party with a casual gesture, and likewise for his past self. Paradoxes are brought up however, which indicates this trope is still in effect, but Scrooge time travels so much that he actively expects to meet older and younger versions of himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FinalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FinalSpace">Final Space</a></em>: Discussed and averted in episode 7, when Quinn meets her future self Nightfall. Quinn asks Nightfall how the two of them being in the same time and place doesnt cause a universe-destroying paradox. Nightfall doesnt know, other than that thing apparently dont work that way.
</li><li> Inverted in the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>. After Omi's time-traveling creates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>, the warriors intentionally seek out Omi's frozen past self, to wake him to meet his future self, creating a paradox that resets the timeline to what it was before.

Two of the same fermion cannot exist in the same place. It's inverted with bosons, which are more likely to exist in the same place than predicted by chance. Time travel is unnecessary here, since the way quantum physics works, any two particles with the same properties are, in fact, the same particle. Interestingly, since chemistry is based on this fact, somehow getting ahold of truly different electrons would be disasterous, if far from reality-destroying.
</li><li> Using special relativity and the last comment, it's easy to make this situation happen in real life, and show that it's not a problem. By moving one particle faster, it can be made to pass through time at a different rate. Since both are the same particle, but more time passed for one, then one of them is a future version of the same particle. They interact as normal, showing that they are, in fact, the same particle, and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustOneSecondOutOfSync" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustOneSecondOutOfSync">Just One Second Out of Sync</a> is not an attribute that exists on a fundamental level.
