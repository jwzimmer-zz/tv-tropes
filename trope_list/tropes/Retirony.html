Retirony is a way to make the audience feel sorry for a character's death without having to actually give him more than ten minutes of screen time. Anybody in a dangerous job who's only a few days away from retirement or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneLastJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneLastJob">flying one last mission</a> before going home to marry their childhood sweetheart is absolutely doomed to death by Retirony, whether that takes the form of a cold-blooded criminal, an ace German fighter pilot or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">great big robotic monster</a>.
</p><p>Just alluding to the existence of a character's family or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFamilyPhoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFamilyPhoto">showing a photo of them</a> is enough for the audience to get the idea: the guy has a life outside of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a>.
</p><p>In the rare case that an exception is made, it is usually because the character is "going home to" a child, especially one his wife gave birth to after he shipped out — perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival">Improbable Infant Survival</a> has a proxy effect? If enough of this happens, they essentially get "promoted" up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt">Mauve Shirt</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">leave for good, alive</a>.

</p><p>Probably not intentional on part of the authors, but one way to interpret Retirony is to think of how fitting it is, as a fate for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">Cosmic Plaything</a>. Suppose that God or Fate is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAssGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAssGods">jerk</a> who nevertheless cares a lot about whatever cause the "retiree" character is working for. In that case, it fits the purposes of fate perfectly to let him survive until it's time to retire, but as soon as he's got no more victories to win, then he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">outlived his usefulness</a> and there's no reason not to let him suffer if that's more fun to watch.

<ul><li> Workplace Insurance Safety Board (WSIB): The Toronto, Ontario-based group produced a series of PSAs in 2006 and 2007 detailing the consequences of neglecting safety in the workplace. At least two of them feature a form of Retirony:
<ul><li> A young sous chef who takes the brunt of an accident involving her slipping on a patch of grease while carrying a pot of boiling hot water. One second, she is talking about her engagement and dream wedding, and plans to become head chef at the upscale restaurant she is working; the next second, she is screaming in pain, having had the water spilled on her.
</li><li> A construction worker who falls to his death after being blown off a tall building when his torch ignites several liquid gas tanks near where he is working. One second, he is detailing plans to take his family on an extended vacation (and also sharing other family accomplishments); an instant later, he lands so hard on the roof of a passing truck his body bounces to the pavement.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile">Last Exile</a></em>: a soldier mentions that he only needs two more battle survival medals to retire, right before a hopeless battle in which it's clear that everyone is going to die. The battle is then cancelled, and the soldier survives. Subverted even more when that same soldier develops a relationship with a former enemy and makes a promise with her that they would both survive; later he appears to die after having saved the day, complete with all the trappings you would normally expect from this sort of death scene...and then, at the end of the last episode, he is shown to still be alive and living with that former enemy.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suitengu</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher">Speed Grapher</a></em> has a case of this, despite not actually dying. As an enslaved child soldier he's in his last mission before being set free when everything, of course, goes wrong, and he ends up the only survivor, experimented on and imbued with strange new powers that reshape the rest of his life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, episode 5: FBI agent Ray Penbar is talking to his fiancée about the family they're going to have, right before Light takes control of him and kills him. Though, in this case, the fact that he ignored his former FBI agent fiancee's advice and reminded her she wouldn't need to think after they get married undermines the sympathy. The wife, on the other hand, is definitely sympathetic (though is still subjected to misogyny).
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrainStrategicArmoredInfantry">Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry</a></em>, the Grabera students are preparing to graduate and become glorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> pilots just like Sara's brother. Guess who swoops in and kills everyone but Sara.
</li><li> In the second-to-last episode of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, the girls decide not to say any "just in case" goodbyes before fighting the final battle, instead choosing to think about where their lives will take them afterward. By the end of the episode, all but the title character are dead. On the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">they get better</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, the first important character to die is Maes Hughes, who was one of the few characters in the series with a still-living family. A running gag in the series was that he would constantly talk about his daughter or wife. This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> when during a flashback to the Ishvalan war, Hughes gets a letter from his then-girlfriend and immediately worries that other men might be taking advantage of his absence. Mustang is quick to point out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">in movies and novels</a> such talks are a sure-fire way to get the bullet.
</li><li> Sent up (like many cliches) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTowerOfDruaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTowerOfDruaga">The Tower of Druaga</a></em>.
<ul><li> In the first episode, as they face the Crimson Knight, Black Knight (), poor, faceless armoured Utu completely out of the blue says he will go home and get married "just after they finish the battle with Crimson Knight, Black Knight." This despite having gone through many battles before this, without saying anything. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">He then charges straight at the Black/Crimson Knight by himself and gets skewered.</a> Then, to show there is no possibility that he could have survived, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">Say My Name</a> moment (UTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!) as well as an <em>on-screen text which says "Utu has died".</em>
</li><li> And again, later in the episode, after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">earlier-defeated</a> Crimson Knight, Black Knight saves the protagonist because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">The Only One Allowed to Defeat You</a>, the Crimson Knight, Black Knight makes the mistake of <em>saying the exact same thing</em>. The caption "taboo words" flashes on the screen, and he is killed the next moment by dragonfire. Finally, in the protagonist's final confrontation with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> says it too.
</li><li> It's referenced again in the very last episode of the last season, a sort of lampshading of the previous lampshading. Right before the big final battle, at a point where we could legitimately expect a main character to die in a non-joke scene (this being the final episode, and after some have already died earlier), Utu actually proposes to Fatina.
<ul><li> Notably, she turns him down immediately, which is probably directly responsible for the fact that everyone survived that battle. Smart move.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">Battle Tendency</a> arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> has a German soldier named Mark show up, and within two pages of his arrival declare that he and his girlfriend are getting married once he gets leave. Five pages later, he's dead. Noticeable in the anime because you can see Speedwagon cringe at the mention of this.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">Vento Aureo</a> arc, right before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Narancia</span> dies they begin talking about everything they're going to do once the Boss is defeated. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wanting to get through highschool, being there for Trish, seeing Fugo again, eating some piping hot pizza and getting his life together</span>. They die a few minutes afterward.
</li></ul></li><li> In an early chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys">20th Century Boys</a></em>, a legendary police detective collapses in the street and dies when he is just one week away from retirement (While on his way to his grandson's birthday party, no less). In this case, there is a reason for the timing. He had just passed on a case he had been working on to a trusted colleague. Unfortunately for him, the colleague was actually working for the enemy and decided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">He Knows Too Much</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> One person in the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> (Asuma/Kurenai), with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy">a kid on the way</a>.
</li><li> Earlier in the series, Hayate Gekkou. While investigating his death, one of the ANBU mentions the fact that he was engaged... to the woman currently staring at his broken sword. Ouch.

When his wife finally gets the letter saying that his transfer went through, he is riding off with the regiment to confront the Apaches. Someone tells her to go, to run and tell him that he should come back, but she says "Sam isn't a coward", and then twists the knife by handing the letter back to the message-boy, saying "Keep it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FaceOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FaceOff">Face/Off</a></em> has an example of retirony where the character retiring doesn't actually die but is about to be put in a bad situation. FBI Agent Sean Archer is about to perform one final task to put an end to the reign of a terrorist (Castor Troy) he had been pursuing for years for killing his son. Once this case was closed he would request a desk job and be away from the action. It doesn't quite work out as planned.
</li><li> The 2009 movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moon">Moon</a></em> has an original and heart-wrenching subversion to it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCannonballRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCannonballRun">The Cannonball Run</a></em> plays this in retrospect.

</li><li> German parody movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DerWixxer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DerWixxer">Neues vom WiXXer</a></em> had a police officer coming into a room where a gunfight was taking place, announcing that his doctor told him he didn't have cancer after all.

</li><li> Turned on its head in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShortTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShortTime">Short Time</a></em> where the main character is <em>deliberately</em> trying to get himself killed while a few days from retirement: mixed up physical results have caused him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForDying">believe he is terminally ill</a> and he's trying to die in the line of duty so that his family can get the police insurance money.

<ul><li> In the theatrical version. When the film originally premiered at Sundance, Eddie killed himself in the last scene of the film: he shot himself through the mouth while on a boat fishing, but the ending was already depressing enough without it. His death scene is a deleted scene on the DVD.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em> really played with this one. The film's prologue begins with an already retired Captain Kirk aboard the maiden voyage of the brand new <em>Enterprise</em>-B. The voyage is a nondescript quick lap around the solar system; it and Kirk's presence (along with Scotty and Chekhov) are solely for the sake of the news crews. Naturally, the underequipped <em>Enterprise</em> has to respond to an emergency crisis, and Kirk "dies" repairing critical damage to the deflectors.
</li><li> This was kind of the fate of the starship <em>Enterprise</em> herself in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a></em>. After completing two historic five-year missions and being upgraded into the Federation's flagship, the <em>Enterprise</em> was removed from active duty and instead made a training vessel. On a routine training cruise, the ship is blasted nearly to scrap by a vengeful madman and is destroyed outright in the sequel.

On April 1, 1958, she was called into a performance of Flower Troupe's Yodogimi/We Children in the Flowers as a replacement for Yuri Hinatsu, who was out sick with a cold. Hiromi's costume was caught in the mechanics of the lift following the end of a scene and an upcoming quick change for the next scene. She was wearing an underskirt with a metal band about the waist, and when her costume became stuck she was unable to free herself. Her feet were dragged into the moving mechanism and the metal band cut into her torso, killing her right in front of her scene-mate, Minako Matsushima.

Being in his golden years, Salim intended on retiring with one last job to go out on. Since that last job was backed by technology from the future and his old gang members were captured, he has been unable to retire officially before the Cooper Gang find him. Even then, he is reluctant to do anything out in the field due to his old age, constantly complaining whenever he has to do anything.	</p>
