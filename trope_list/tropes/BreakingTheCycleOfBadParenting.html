<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Orihime own parents were stated to have been abusive by her older brother (who ran off with her as soon as he was old enough to act as her legal guardian). In contrast, she's shown to be a loving and attentive mother to Kazui in the epilogue.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em>:

He's trying to be a more affectionate father towards his own daughter Sarada after spending a long time being away.
</li><li> Hinata is a kind but still strict mother to both Boruto and Himawari. Contrast to her own father Hiashi who was emotionally distant and looked down on Hinata throughout most of her childhood because he thought she was weak.
</li><li> Gaara ends up adopting a son named Shinki. Shinki is shown to be very happy with Gaara and Gaara himself is very encouraging towards Shinki. Compare that to Gaara's father who ordered his death when he was still a child.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>. Kaguya's father is the very definition of neglectful, and while she may not be a parent yet, Yume's fortune telling during the culture festival (which was 100% accurate in every other respect) said that she would grow up to be "a good wife and a wise mother".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>: Fate Testarossa was raised by her incredibly abusive mother (at least until she was adopted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">Lindy Harlaown</a>), and from <em>StrikerS</em> onward she is driven to be as good a parent as possible to her three adopted children. While she normally does a good job, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotMyFather">her desire to not repeat her mother's mistakes</a> occasionally causes her to overcompensate and come across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a>.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em>, Wally West's parents weren't the best. Their treatment of him ranged from emotionally to physically abusive, with a dose of manipulation when he became an adult. It got to the point that Wally, as a kid, would cherish his summer visits to his aunt Iris because it got him away from his parents. Once Wally became a father with twins, he was shown to be very loving and protective of them. He was even willing to confront the entire Justice League when he thought they were going to take them away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a></em>: Roy Harper to Oliver Queen. While Ollie does care for his ward, he was shown as be neglectful and unable to notice Roy's drug addiction. And when he did, he disowned Roy. In contrast, Roy did everything he could for his daughter Lian even though he was a single parent and did make mistakes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHulk">Bruce Banner</a> had an horribly abusive father, so both he and Hulk (in one of those instances where both personas agree on something) try to be a kind and caring father to their son Skaar.

When Eddie learns he has a son, one who grew up under Eddie's father thinking that Eddie was his brother, he tries to damnedest to not continue the abuse, though his life as Venom makes this difficult at times.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BluefursChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BluefursChoice">Bluefur's Choice</a></em>, Bluefur decides to be involved in her children's apprenticeships because her own mother was distant during her apprenticeship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CodexEquus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CodexEquus">Codex Equus</a></em>: One way for someone to break free of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">Vicious Cycles</a> that constantly plague Equus is to discard previous abusive patterns and show their children (biological or adopted) the love and respect they deserve.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Poenan deities</a> (and their mortal followers) raised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">Silver Bane</a> to follow their ruthless philosophy of Justice, and gave him harmful, hypocritical, and self-righteous teachings that would have eventually killed him if his friends and other benevolent individuals hadn't intervened and saved him. After adopting Friede, he would become a <em>much</em> better surrogate parent for her than the Poenans had ever been for him, as he genuinely tried to be a good father and role model for his daughter - to the point where Friede <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">started crying openly and loudly for the first time</a> after he got severely injured and fell into a coma that he would later wake up from.
</li><li> As a colt, Prince Blueblood's birth parents emotionally abused him in their attempts to mold him into the ideal Scion of House Platinum, including trying to destroy his childhood dreams of being an adventurer after he got a compass rose Cutie Mark. Years later, after he was adopted by Princess Celestia and he was introduced to Prince Léon, then an infant Alicorn, he initially had doubts over his parenting skills and feared having Léon's innocence corrupted by Equestria's incompetent, selfish, and cruel nobility... but he ultimately chose to take responsibility and become the good parent to Léon that his own parents were not, resulting in an emotionally well-adjusted toddler. Both Luminiferous and Celestia believe that lots of good things await him if he continues raising Léon right.
</li><li> The parents of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelPrince">Prince Golden Ash</a> were not abusive to him or his brother, but they still held the toxic, xenophobic, and reactionary beliefs shared by the larger Alvslog Deer Herds and promoted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">Elternteil Deer Pantheon</a>. Years later, after settling down in Kerajaan Cahaya and marrying his husband Victory Road, Golden Ash would become a father himself after adopting a young orphaned pegasus colt. Unlike his parents, though, Golden Ash is a genuinely loving parent who is raising his son outside of the harmful beliefs that he himself grew up with.

As a result, Cinderella wants to be the best mother she could be to her own children. She gets upset when her husband tells her that he's been keeping their young son away from her because she's weak from her difficult pregnancy. Years later, Cinderella's bottled up emotions explode and she grabs her son's hand in anger, but she's instantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">horrified by being so physical with her child</a>.

However, Pizzazz ends up being too doting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">smothers her son</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Restraint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Restraint">Restraint</a></em>: Azula grew up with an emotionally neglectful mother and a physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive father. She <em>wants</em> to be a better parent than her own parents were, but she's so emotionally stunted and unsure of how to bond with others that she does the opposite. Her wife, Ty Lee, has to call her out specifically because she's neglecting their toddler, Azusami.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheSecondTry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheSecondTry">The Second Try</a></em>: Both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shinji and Asuka</span> are phenomenally better parents to their daughter, Aki, than their own parents ever were for them, managing to raise her in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a post-apocalyptic environment</span> while dealing with their own psychoses and still have her come out well adjusted enough to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> integrate into normal society when they're sent back in time</span>.

And as for Bruce Wayne... as much the two honestly did love each other in the end, Bruce was <em>not</em> a good father. He was emotionally unstable, and that lead to him being anywhere from neglectful to outright cruel and abusive to his children whenever he was hit hard with something. Left with all these examples of bad parenting, Jason strove to be completely unlike all of them when he ended up becoming a father, and besides some bouts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">overprotectiveness</a>, succeeded. His children absolutely <em>adored</em> him, and when he died, heavily mourned his death.

While he's making an effort to be a more active mentor/father-figure, he still rarely takes Peter's calls, having him make reports to Happy instead (though he does refer back to one of those reports, proving that he did listen to them), and when Peter comes to him for advice about an illegal arms deal, Tony basically blows him off, leading to the situation getting worse, for which he then blames Peter. He's gotten better by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a>,</em> where he still tries to keep Peter away from dangerous situations, but does take time to discuss plans with Peter and actually takes advice from him.

I mean, Quents mean, but he works hard, makes a decent living for his family, and he doesnt hit your mother- leastways, not as I could ever tell. But your Grampaw Grady? *Phew!* Now THERE was a mean old man! I remember back in Middle School, he never missed a chance to humiliate Quent in front of the other kids. He wasnt ever quite drunk, but he always had a beer or two under his belt. Never spent a penny on his family that he didnt absolutely have to. And he put Quent and his sister in the hospital a couple of times that Im sure of. <br/>If Quent has a single redeeming trait, its that hes not as bad as his father was.

</li><li> Downplayed with Benny. While she was abusive towards George, she does genuinely loves him and did the best at raising him. In contrast, her father was an alcoholic abuser and her mother considers her worthless.
</li></ul></li><li> Murray Goldberg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs">The Goldbergs</a></em> does call his kids morons from time to time and often doesn't get them when it comes to any of their interests.

The same could not be said of her parents. Especially her mother who had all of Thelma's negative aspect but with none of her positives. In fact, an apparition of Thelma's mother actually causes her to be afraid of it as she starts criticizing everything Thelma does.
</li><li> Vinton is a interesting case of being this and invoking it. In the early season when he had his two kids Buzz and Sonja, he never once belittled them like Thelma did to him. In fact, Buzz himself told him he was a good dad since a lesser person could have easily abandon him and Sonia. In a later season when he and Naomi were trying for a child and Sonia and Buzz were retconned out, he told Thelma he was going to be a great dad since he would encourage his child.

Christy was raised by her alcoholic and drug using mom Bonnie who messed up her childhood. Unfortunately, Christy does the exact same thing to Violet and Roscoe. However, the series does start with her in recovery and makes genuine efforts to be a good parent and make up for her mistakes. It just doesn't stick most of the time. Even Bonnie's own mother left her when she was young and never return even when her life was stable. While Bonnie did keep Christy and did attempt to raise her, she still messed up. And while Violet did give up her baby, she made sure she went to a loving family.

These include using his name for credit card loans and damaging his credit score and using Christmas as a time to sell stuff to make extra money and not celebrating it with him. However, they are still treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">Good Parents</a> who love Jimmy and did the best they could given they were teen parents. They even made up ruining Jimmy's Christmases by treating other non-major holidays as special so he wouldn't be left out. Jimmy for his part tries harder to raise Hope like getting a stable job so he could get some Health Care and makes sure she has a better childhood then his.
</li><li> Despite the mistakes Burt and Virginia did while raising Jimmy, they are still better parents than their own. Burt's played favorite with his older brother and never thought Burt would ever amount to anything. While Virginia's parents left her while she was still young to be raised by her grandparents. Her father was also narcissistic who tried to change her life to better fit his own needs. Though, he is shown to still love her compare to the mother.
</li><li> Sabrina was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">Lonely Rich Kid</a> whose parents were barely there. Worst was her mother who would bad mouth Sabrina, hurting her emotionally. Sabrina became a wonderful mother to Hope.

<ul><li> Invoked by Darlene after a bad day with her grandmother. She mentions how Bev's mom wasn't a good mother, that Bev was better then her, and Roseanne is really better then Bev. She then concludes that when she has a kid, she'll be a super mom.
</li><li> Going from the above, Roseanne is seen as a better mom then her father who abused her and Jackie and her mother who was critical and didn't do anything to stop the abuse. She does love her kids despite her yelling and manipulation as she wants them to do better then she did. When she hit DJ after a very frustrating day, she was traumatized by the incident as she didn't want to be like her father.
</li><li> Dan grew up with a barely-there father and a mentally ill mother who actually attempted to kill him when he was an adult. He is shown to be a very loving father who does spend time with his kids, and who is also shown to be very protective of them.
</li><li> Jackie herself actively invokes this trope for Andy as she wants to be a better mother then Bev who she hates. However, it's shown she sometimes overdoes it and comes off more as an overprotective parent. However, a conversation between Bev and Jackie does have the former admit she was a bad mother and Jackie was a good one.
</li><li> Subverted with Bev and her mother Mary. Mary was a very free-spirited parent which actually cause Bev to grow up to be very strict to Roseanne and Jackie. Both styles are shown to be very bad.

They are not perfect parents, what with the fact they are self-absorbed by their need for attention or career ambitions, but they do prove to be better parents to Quinn and Daria than their own parents have been to them. Jake tries to understand his daughters (backing up Daria's less conformist moments and personality while merely expressing surprise at the idea that Quinn could be dating women without any sense of contempt), and Helen's relationship with Daria actually evolves from that of a social/career climbing woman who has more or less sold out her Sixties-era feminist beliefs to urge her daughter to fit in, to that of a trusted mother and a sensitive young adult daughter who can communicate on an emotional and intellectual level.

</li><li> Suyin came uncomfortably close to looping back into being as overprotective as her grandparents when she tried to stop her daughter Opal from leaving to develop her bending powers. With Lin's encouragement, Opal was able to convince Suyin to find a balance between caring for her children and stifling their personal growth, making Suyin a more successful example of this trope than her mother.

Doofenshmirtz himself, on the other hand, is over-protective, if anything, to his daughter, Vanessa, finding her one of the few things he loves outside of his evil schemes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>. Cheshire's parents were both super-villains, with her father Sportsmaster raising her as a mercenary. Her mother was sent to jail and reformed upon coming out but her father is still an active criminal. In contrast, Cheshire loves Lian dearly and wanted Roy to clean up his act for his daughter's sake as much as Roy's. In fact, while Cheshire did abandon Lian by season 3, its because she believes Lian would be better off without a mercenary mother.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em>: Numbuh 1's father, Monty Uno <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also known as Numbuh Zero</span> was raised by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grandfather</span>, who was willing use his own kids as slave labor. Monty himself does his best to bond with Numbuh 1, all the while letting him having more freedom. Numbuh 1, despite finding his father embarrassing, does have a pretty good relationship with him.
</li><li> The short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GodTheDevilAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GodTheDevilAndBob">God, the Devil and Bob</a></em> had "Bob's Father", which shows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Bob's father</a> was an emotionally-abusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who did nothing but belittle his son till the moment he died. This causes Bob to have a crisis of fate upon learning his father was forgiven by God and allowed into heaven, despite a life time of abuse. Later in the episode, Bob shouts at Andy for leaving his toys out combined with his anger over the situation over his father, only Andy to calmly reply "That's okay Dad. I know you're upset about Grandpa." Doing so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">calms Bob down</a>, and he immediately apologizes and compliments Andy on being so insightful.
<ul><li> This is invoked by God later in the episode, who explains that he and his father come from a long line of abusive fathers, and while that doesn't excuse how Bob's dad treated him, Bob's dad was at least trying to "throw a softer punch", which allowed Bob to be the one to finally break the cycle.
