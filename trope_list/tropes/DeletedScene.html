</p><p>A scene made for a work (in part or completed), but not included in the final release. These are often put back in special editions or included on the DVD release. They are also sometimes included in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication">heavily-cut</a> broadcast TV versions of films to stretch them back to a reasonable length. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">Novelization</a> often includes scenes that end up cut from the final film, as adaptations are often based on shooting scripts to ensure that the novel will be ready for release in conjunction with the film. Due to the nature of animated works, any extra scenes in these productions are usually removed during the storyboard or animatic phase, though rough animation hitting the cutting room floor is common. A scene with completed animation being cut is almost unheard of, but can still occur depending on why the scene was cut.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Scenes can be cut for a number of different reasons. Often the scenes are of much lower quality, so they were deleted for good reason. Yet some may contain details that appeal to audiences. Among the reasons include:
</p><ul><li> Reducing the overall running time, especially for theaters where a lower running time means an increased number of showings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail">Improving the pacing and story by cutting out the excess fat</a>.
</li><li> Getting rid of what turned out to be a bad scene or a poorly executed sequence.
</li><li> A change in the productions aim to ensure a different rating. Quite often it is because of the desire to include the PG-13 crowd from an R rating. More rarely it is an angle to make it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> and appeal to the R crowd. More generally, scenes may be removed to change the tone of the movie, regardless of the desired rating.

</li><li> A massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisedEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisedEnding">change to the ending</a>.
</li><li> More cynically, some works might be suspected of having "Deleted Scenes" just so they can be included in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition">Limited Special Collector's Ultimate Edition</a> or adding extra sex and violence for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnratedEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnratedEdition">Unrated Edition</a>.
</li></ul><p>If the scenes are included into the flow of the work, then its a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recut">recut</a> and usually marketed as a "Directors Cut" or "Extended Edition". More commonly the scenes are included in the Special Features section of a DVD release as a bonus feature.
</p><p>In terms of 'cutting out excess fat', many directors will point out, via DVD commentary, that a particular scene worked just fine as it was filmed, but when viewed in the context of the film overall, the scene in question simply dragged on too long or ruined the desired emotion of a moment, and was thus cut to keep the energy of a particular sequence up.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This isn't limited to films though. All works, be they television shows, comic books, or even pieces of literature are subject to this trope thanks to the very fact they all usually go through an editing process that have the creators re-evaluate how they're telling the story. The general public is just more likely to hear of examples in films due to the expectations that come with a DVD/Blu-Ray of those products, while similar releases for other works usually scrape by with their bonus features being more general ideas and vague descriptions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a>. The slower production cycle of a film also lends itself better to having more "substantial" deleted content to throw onto the disc, as opposed to the faster schedules of television.
</p><p>The canonicity of a deleted scene will vary from case to case. Especially for material that was simply cut due to time constraints, the story elements at play in those scenes may still be part of the overall storyline. This is where an apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a> can occur, because the deleted scene may have held necessary information for a sub-plot or even the main story. Although the reverse can also be true, with the scene being deleted <em>because</em> it created a plot hole. In such a case, and in others where a story's feel is changed by the removal of a scene, the removed content has probably been decanonized.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em>, as mentioned below, a scene removed from the theatrical version (included in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectorsCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectorsCut">Director's Cut</a>) shows that the colonists were deliberately <em>sent</em> to the derelict space craft by someone in the corporation (Burke). However, without this scene, it's never explained why the colony has suddenly been attacked after ~twenty years of nothing happening other than perhaps it only being a matter of time. This wouldn't be an issue except for the scene where Ripley reveals to Burke that she found out that he ordered the investigation and is to blame for the colony's deaths. At this point, the audience has not been informed that there even <em>was</em> a scouting mission to search for the derelict ship and that's what triggered these events. Although it's understandable in context from their dialogue that Burke is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenVillain">Hidden Villain</a>, the particulars don't make a lot of sense without the deleted scene.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>: Due to a magazine change and timing issues, Hoshino could not include some scenes of the Alma Karma arc in the original weekly magazine releases. The absence of Fô in Alma's flashback was creating a plot hole that caused some sorrow to the author so she included an extra chapter only in the volumes: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Twi had ordered to not protect them in order to put an end to the second exorcist program forever and pay for their sins. Fo stayed there watching her masters being slaughtered while not being able to do anything . She note the cruel irony of the situation afterwards: "asking a guardian spirit to not protect...how stupid".</span>
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever">Diamonds Are Forever</a></em> the unfortunate fate of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Plenty O'Toole is explained by a deleted scene where Plenty returned to Bond's apartment after she had been thrown out the window wearing nothing by her flimsy see through panties and purple high heels. When she returns the soaking wet Plenty is wearing nothing but a white towel to cover her basically naked body and enters quietly in the hopes of retrieving her clothes and to see what has become of Bond. She becomes quietly angry when she sees him screwing Tiffany Case and almost leaves in a fit... until she sees Tiffany's purse, goes through it and finds Tiffany's address.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em> has a slightly skewed chronology because of a deleted scene. It does show that in the time between when they landed in the past and when they destroyed Vulcan, Nero and his guys did not spend years dicking around. He and his crew were captured and held prisoners by the Klingons during that time. Similarly, there's a deleted scene just before the one where young Kirk steals the car: the teenager he passes on the road is his older brother George, and he steals the car and takes it on a joyride because its owner had just kicked George out of the house.
</li><li> A deleted scene from the DVD of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleNicky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleNicky">Little Nicky</a></em> shows Nicky explaining on who created the flask and why does Nicky have it rather than just trap his brothers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a> Episode I: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em>:
<ul><li> A deleted scene reveals why Obi-Wan didn't just use his own lightsaber to destroy the droids chasing him in the swamp. (Evidently, you don't want to drop a lightsaber in swamp water if you can help it.)
</li><li> Another deleted scene shows Anakin fighting a young Greedo which explains why Qui-Gon was treating his wounds in the next scene.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, the Emperor was to tell Anakin that from a certain point of view, he is Anakin's father.
</li><li> A scene cut from the initial airing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever">Turtles Forever</a></em> had Karai explaining <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how she found Ch'rell and the Technodome</span>
</li><li> The extended version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em> features a scene explaining how they managed to upload a virus onto the alien mothership by using a laptop. Apparently, the Earth technology is compatible with the ones Aliens have due to it being reverse-engineered from the Roswell UFO (same as with Megatron from live-action <em>Transformers</em>).
</li><li> Volume 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill">Kill Bill</a></em> has a deleted scene which has Bill and the Bride visiting China (most likely to introduce her to Pai Mei), and which has Bill facing off against the former student of a guy who Bill killed and his handful of mooks, in a scene straight out of one of the old Shaw Brothers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChopSocky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChopSocky">Chop Socky</a> movies.
</li><li> A deleted scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em> would have explained why the police never come to the aid of either <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mr. Orange</span> or Marvin Nash. The scene shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Orange's undercover supervisor</span> Holdaway explaining that they couldn't put a hidden camera in the warehouse without arousing suspicion; while the police would have the exterior under distant surveillance, they were under strict orders not to appear until Joe Cabot emerged from the warehouse carrying the diamonds so he would be caught red-handed.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lntcg3epiJo">deleted scene from late in season four<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OZ">OZ</a></em> shows Chris Keller moving back into Tobias Beecher's cell, thereby explaining why he is suddenly there again in a later episode.
</li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTheNameOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTheNameOfTheKing">In the Name of the King</a>: A Dungeon Siege Tale</em> had the editors cut out a scene after a duel between the real king's brother (who wanted to be king and shot his brother with an arrow in the middle of a battle) and the commander of the army. After the main character comes in and is proclaimed king, the commander grabs the brother and slits his throat. This leaves viewers questioning "What happened?" as in the theatrical cut the guy never appears again, seemingly vanishing into thin air.
</li><li> The scene were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pippa's mother kills her</span> was ultimately removed from the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadSet">Dead Set</a></em> in order to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">give the scene where Space sees her zombified form more impact</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnakeEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnakeEyes">Snake Eyes</a></em>: The original plan for the climactic chase scene involved Nic Cage having to go through a flooded tunnel, an event he later claims to have a recurring nightmare about in the epilogue, and actually filmed but replaced in the actual movie with a much less-exciting tunnel-free chase.
</li><li> One of the deleted scenes featured on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LooneyTunesBackInAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LooneyTunesBackInAction">Looney Tunes: Back in Action</a></em> DVD shows why the Acme VPs had to press their buzzers whenever they spoke up.

Koopa catches one of his technicians sneezing and has the poor guy turned into primordial ooze as he demands Mario and Luigi tell him where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">the rock</a> is. This scene explains why, when Mario and Luigi push Koopa into the devo-chair immediately following, there's some slimy substance on the ground at that point; it's the remains of the unfortunate technician.
</li><li> An early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode had Shelly lighting Stan on fire and then putting him out. This was cut because of the recent outcry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> had made claiming (incorrectly) that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead">Beavis And Butthead</a></em> had encouraged an accident involving fire. This results in a scene where Stan is laying in a pool of water for no reason.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> A shot in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Half-Blood Prince</a></em> trailer shows Ginny being disarmed by Fenir Greyback, explaining why she didn't raise her wand to defend herself in that scene. If you're wondering why she has her wand later in that scene, you can briefly see her reaching for the ground in the final cut, obviously to retrieve her wand, but the movie cuts away from her at that moment.
</li><li> A deleted scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a>, Part 1</em> shows Ron explaining that saying Voldemort's name is now taboo and will bring Death Eaters. Viewers are left wondering in the completed film why they immediately appear at Xenophilius Lovegood's house after he says it.
</li><li> A deleted scene from <em>Deathly Hallows, Part 2</em> explains why Luna is at Hogwarts when the Trio gets there, despite them having apparently left her at Shell Cottage earlier in the film.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard2">Die Hard 2</a></em>, after Colonel Stuart takes control of Dulles International Airport's tower controls, Lorenzo has his SWAT team escort airport engineer Leslie Barnes to the under-construction Annex Skywalk to repair the satellite dish and reestablish communication with the planes. Just before they reach the antenna dish, the SWAT escorts are ambushed and killed by a team of Stuart's henchmen who are disguised as painters and mechanics (Barnes manages to take cover, though he gets a nasty cut on his arm from shards of flying glass). A deleted scene called "Down the Rabbit Hole" - which would have fallen in between the scene where Baker and Thompson kill the church custodian, and the scene where Miller, Cochrane and Garber are rendezvousing in a bar at the terminal - shows two of the Skywalk henchmen - O'Reilly and Sheldon - approach two painters unloading paint cans from their van. O'Reilly shoots both of them, then they load their bodies into the back of the vehicle and lock the doors.

The sequel begins with him being released from jail and resuming his search for Jett Records' next big thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monkeybone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monkeybone">Monkeybone</a></em> has tons of Deleted Scenes thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. No major plot points, but a lot of little things are suddenly explained after seeing them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legend1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Legend1985">Legend (1985)</a></em> there was an extended opening sequence involving the goblins trying and failing to capture the unicorns. When they report back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big D</a>, Blunder interrupts to brag about his role in the attempt and is punished for speaking out of turn by having his left hand turned into a chicken foot by Darkness, explaining why he has that for the rest of the movie. Without this scene, his chicken-foot hand goes unaddressed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King</a></em> had Nala being near Timon and Pumbaa's Oasis for no discernable reason (which resulted in her nearly killing Pumbaa before re-encountering Simba). A deleted scene (and deleted song, called "The Madness of King Scar") revealed that the reason she was there was because Scar had exiled her from the Pridelands due to her refusing Scar's proposal to have her become his queen (with the implication that he attempted to rape her). The scene was retained in the musical, however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic (1997)</a></em>:
<ul><li> The last time you see Lovejoy, he is limping and his face is bleeding. This isn't due to injuries caused in the ongoing disaster; a deleted scene has Cal send Lovejoy after Rose and Jack after he realizes the Heart of the Ocean is with Rose, and Jack beats Lovejoy in a fight.
</li><li> A smaller version from the same film. When Rose is preparing to jump from the <em>Titanic</em>, she's no longer wearing the necklace she had on at dinner—she's quite disheveled in fact. A deleted scene shows that she went to her room and tore off the necklace in a fit of hysteria.
</li><li> In the original cut, the blonde girl that stares at Rose as she hangs from the railing on the back of the sinking ship, was Fabrizzio's love interest and a friend of Rose and Jack, but most scenes involving her were cut. The two women's silent last interaction has a different meaning if you know this.
</li><li> The original ending has Lovett surprising old Rose before she throws the Heart of the Ocean into the sea. She explains that the reason she contacted them in the first place was because she wanted to throw the Heart on the place the Titanic sank.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch">Sucker Punch</a></em> has a scene which was deleted because it explained what the movie was about in detail, and drove the point home. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a> was forced to delete it over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardian">Moral Guardian</a> issues. Regardless it explains a plot hole and a facial expression.
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> had a short deleted scene where they put the original Megatron's spark back into his body, resolving what seems like a pretty big oversight in the final cut.
<p></p></li><li> The deluxe DVD edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoogieNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoogieNights">Boogie Nights</a></em> has a deleted sequence where Becky calls Dirk after being beaten by her husband and Dirk ramming his 'Vette into a telephone pole on the way to help her (which finally explained why in later scenes the car was wrecked).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> had a traitor subplot cut from the final release due to poor audience reception at a test screening, but several scenes in the final cut of the movie rely on the subplot to make sense. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">Novelization</a> of the film includes the subplot, and as a result the story flows more smoothly.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> movies have some notable deleted scenes:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Part I</a>:
<ul><li> One deleted scene is an extended version of the scene where Doc is setting up a line to channel the lightning bolt's electric current to the DeLorean. In the final film, an officer comes along and asks Doc if he has a permit. We see Doc rummage in his wallet for the permit as Marty tucks the note warning Doc about his demise at the Libyans' hands in 1985 into his coat pocket. The deleted scene shows that the "permit" is actually a $50 bill, quite a bit of money back in 1955. Marty also worries about the psychological repercussions of his plan.
<div class="indent"><strong>Marty:</strong>' You know, this is the kind of thing that could screw me up permanently. What if I go back to the future and I end up bein'... gay?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Doc:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">Why SHOULDN'T you be happy?</a>
</div></li><li> When Doc and Marty go to the high school for the first time so that Marty can point out his parents to Doc, the actual film cuts from them walking past the bike racks to Marty pointing out George to Doc. In the deleted scene, Marty looks through a classroom window and see Lorraine cheating on a test:
<div class="indent"><strong>Marty McFly:</strong> Holy shit! She's cheating! <em>[to Doc]</em> She's—-she's my mom.
</div><div class="indent"><em>[Cuts to Lorraine and her friends leaving class a few minutes later]</em>
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Lorraine Baines:</strong> I got an F anyway...
</div></li><li> An extended version of the scene where Marty sneaks into George's bedroom posing as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Darth Vader</a>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraterrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraterrestrial">extraterrestrial</a> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">planet Vulcan</a>". Here, we see Marty specifically order George to ask Lorraine out while threatening him a hairdryer (which he calls a brain melting gun), and chloroforming George afterwards before jumping out the window and climbing into Doc's car. The scene was cut because the very next scene had George tell Marty about the encounter, rendering it redundant; however, the chloroform served to explain why George's remark "I overslept!"
</li><li> Remember the suitcase Doc packed before being shot by the Libyans? In 1955, just before Marty shows the video, Doc finds the suitcase and looks through its contents, which includes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/PlayBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/PlayBoy">Play Boy</a> magazine and the hairdryer used in the extended "Darth Vader" scene.
</li><li> Wonder why George was eating peanut brittle for dinner in 1985? Originally, after talking to Biff, Marty tries to urge George to stand up for himself at a child selling peanut brittle. But instead, he caves, buying all of the brittle, with the child's father saying "See, I told you we'd only have to stop at one house."
</li><li> Why did George take so long to go to the parking lot? Being a nerd, George went into a phone booth to call the operator to confirm the time. But Dixon, the teen who'd kicked George when he had the "Kick Me" sign on his back and cuts in on George and Lorraine during "Earth Angel", traps him inside. George cries for help, only to have Mr. Strickland chastise him for being a slacker.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">Part II</a></em>
<ul><li> One deleted scene has Marty encounter Dave in 1985-A outside Biff Tannen's Pleasure Palace Casino. The scene shows that Dave is a drunken and ramshackle hobo. According to the DVD commentary by producers Gale and Neil Canton, the scene was deleted because Wendie Jo Sperber, who played Marty's sister Linda in the first film, was pregnant at the time and thus could not be featured in the sequel; they felt that if Marty's brother was seen, people would wonder what happened to his sister as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says she would have been a prostitute in 1985-A. The scene did appear, however, in the novelization.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII">Part III</a></em>
<ul><li> After Marty and the 1955 Doc excavate the buried DeLorean, they touch one of the tires, which immediately turns to dust, which explains why Doc was looking at a decayed tire while putting the DeLorean on the tow-truck.
</li><li> In one deleted scene, readable in the novelization, Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen and his gang ride toward town for Buford's showdown with Marty. They are stopped by Marshal Strickland and his son, who have shotguns trained at Buford and are intending to stop him. Buford shoots the marshal's shotgun out of his hands, then orders his son to put his gun down as well, before giving the Marshal a stern order to ride out of town for a few hours and leave him alone while he deals with Marty. Marshal Strickland and his son start to trot off, with Buford training his revolver on the Marshal's back. Suddenly, Buford shoots the Marshal in the back. As the Marshal collapses, Buford shouts, "I lied, Marshal!" then he and his gang ride off. With his dying breath, the marshal tells his son, "Remember that word, son: discipline," to which the son replies "I will, pa." This scene was cut because it was too dark for the content of the rest of the franchise. Had it been retained in the movie, this would be the crime for which the deputy is arresting Buford after his duel with Marty. It also explains why Strickland's deputy is arresting Buford, and not Strickland himself. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">after what he did</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">it didn't seem right that Buford did not die</a>. The producers were worried the audience would want Marty to kill Buford, but he couldn't because Buford needed to live long enough to extend the Tannen family line.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace">Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</a></em> lost a whole plot hole-fixing <em>subplot</em> in scene deletions. The finished film's Nuclear Man is actually Lex Luthor's <em>second</em> attempt at a Superman knockoff. The first is more akin to Bizarro, and during his encounter with Superman he sees and falls for Lacy Warfield. After his defeat, this Nuclear Man's remains are incorporated into the creation of the second Nuclear Man — which turns out to have retained the memories of the first one, explaining why he decides to kidnap Lacy after seeing her face on the front cover of the <em>Daily Planet</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bubble">Bubble</a></em> removes scenes where Martha is told that she has a tumor in her brain that can cause blackouts and strange behavior. This explains <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">why she murdered Rose, why she has headaches, and why she's occasionally engulfed in bright light</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeShesLikeInAComa">much as been said about the fact that the Prince kisses Snow White while she's assumed dead</a>: YES, we know it will revive her since we saw the Witch worrying about that when she was preparing the spell, but <em>he</em> didn't. Actually, a scene where the Witch was holding the Prince prisoner, in which she would have inadvertently told him about the way to break the spell, was scrapped because the animators didn't manage to animate the Prince convincingly. This scene, however, survived in the comic strip adaptation and was reworked into the similar scene where Maleficent holds Prince Philipp prisoner in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SantaClausTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SantaClausTheMovie">Santa Claus: The Movie</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">Novelization</a> has many scenes that didn't make the finished film and haven't surfaced as DVD extras, but most likely were shot; some fill in major and minor plot points:
<ul><li> A brief shot in the film of a boy sitting outside a Romany Gypsy caravan writing a letter to Santa in the first "Santa through the years" montage? Turns out he's from a musical family but cannot play an instrument or sing, and wants something that will allow him to perform music as well. Santa assigns this challenge to Patch, who invents a hurdy-gurdy for the boy.
</li><li> Another scene had Patch inventing a hula hoop — about 100 years in advance of the fad — and being told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">It Will Never Catch On</a>.
</li><li> The interlude about Santa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeightWoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeightWoe">Weight Woe</a> after he's described as fat in "A Visit from St. Nicholas" continued into a Christmas go-round where he desperately tries to resist eating the cookies that have been left out for him. He decides that he can't disappoint the kids who care about him, enjoys the cookies, and tells his reindeer as they depart that people <em>expect</em> Santa Claus to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun">Big Fun</a>, having decided he's happy with himself the way he is.
</li><li> After the Christmas Eve of the puce pop delivery, Santa Claus decides to delay his return to the North Pole and instead revisits New York City as the morning dawns. He discovers that the presents he brought are already being tossed into the trash unopened, as kids are too crazy for the lollipops. He even talks to some kids about this and then asks them what they <em>gave others</em> for Christmas — and they're flummoxed and mocking of the very idea. This is what spurs his gloomy monologue to Anya in the finished film, and the sequence also appears in the Marvel Comics adaptation.
</li><li> There was a <em>lot</em> more to the ending — namely, all of the finished film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">Left Hanging</a> issues were resolved. First, Patch apologizes for screwing things up so badly and mends fences with his rival Puffy, with the implication that Puffy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays">Good Old Ways</a> approach will ensure that Patch's ideas work as intended (which also fixes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>). Santa and Mrs. Claus decide to adopt Joe <em>and</em> Cornelia. And finally, after the celebration Santa starts getting letters from children apologizing to him for not appreciating his presents in favor of the puce pops, and already putting in requests for next Christmas, proving that they no longer hold the one Christmas of defective gifts against him.
</li></ul></li><li> A deleted scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCraft">The Craft</a></em> has Sarah, Bonnie and Rochelle showing concern for Nancy as the power of Mannon goes to her head. She loses it and chews them all out, telling Bonnie and Rochelle that they're losers without her and warning Sarah not to screw with her. Bonnie and Rochelle's decision to side with Nancy over Sarah later in the film would make more sense if this scene were kept in the film (either out of fear or guilt). Otherwise, they just turn on Sarah for no real reason.
</li><li> A deleted scene in the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E19KillTheAlligatorAndRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E19KillTheAlligatorAndRun">Kill the Alligator and Run</a>" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> depicts a funeral being held for Captain Jack at the Six Toe County Courthouse (one of the funeral attendees is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidRock">Kid Rock</a>), which would explain why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Captain Jack emerges from within the courthouse</span> at the end of the episode.

<ul><li> The broadcast version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ErnestGoesToJail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ErnestGoesToJail">Ernest Goes To Jail</a></em> features several scenes not in the VHS or DVD releases, including a final scene before the credits where Ernest finally becomes a bank clerk...only to be magnetized again by an electric shock from his keyboard and chased from his desk by a filing cabinet.
<ul><li> An earlier additional scene had Ernest (who they believe to be Nash) brought into a room the night before his execution to be entertained by a lady of the night. Naive Ernest, not knowing what's in store for him, is heard off-camera screaming. The scene ends with him being physically dragged out of the room by two guards, completely exhausted.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a> I</em> and <em>II</em> were released in 1977 as a television miniseries called <em>The Godfather Saga</em>, supposedly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> needed to raise more money for the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow">Apocalypse Now</a></em>. <em>Saga</em> incorporated more than an hour's worth of minor character scenes and setup moments, including more footage of young Vito in <em>II</em> and the original ending of <em>I</em> (where Kay prays to an altar during the credits). It was later reaired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AMC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AMC">AMC</a> in 2012 to commemorate the first film's 40th anniversary.
</li><li> In the TV version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyGilmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyGilmore">Happy Gilmore</a></em>, there is a scene where Happy meets the cruel orderly, and, after finding out what he's been doing to the residents (his grandma in particular) beats him up and tosses him out a window where he gets attacked by the other residents of the nursing home. This is more satisfying, as in the released version, he gets away with all he does.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABCFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABCFamily">ABC Family</a> cuts of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> films often restore the deleted scenes that have been released.

The two major scenes in this cut (a board meeting between InGen executives and a longer introduction to Roland Tembo) are included as deleted scenes on the recent DVD release.
</li><li> The initial television broadcast of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> movie included several deleted scenes that were character-oriented and cut from the theatrical release for timing (along with one which showed a spacesuited Kirk floating out of of a half-<em>Enterprise</em>, half-soundstage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">Special Effects Failure</a> in pursuit of Spock). These scenes were eventually restored in the definitive Director's Cut DVD which also featured a number of new special effects sequences.
</li><li> The various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">Superman</a></em> films have had additional scenes added. To wit: the theatrical version of the 1978 Superman runs just over two hours, the extended edition runs almost half-an-hour longer, while the TV version runs almost <em>three hours</em> (with extra scenes like the resolution of the Kryptonian Executioner subplot, Luthor playing the piano multiple times and Lois being revealed as the young girl who saw Clark run past her to catch the train as a young boy).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopSecret">Top Secret!</a></em> has a few deleted scenes which sometimes appear in television broadcasts.

In it, Eddie Valiant is caught snooping in Jessica's dressing room, causing Judge Doom to order the Weasels to take Eddie into Toontown and paint a toon pig's head on him. On his emerging from Toon Town, Eddie goes to his office to wash it off, which explains why he's just out of the bathroom when Jessica goes to talk to him.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie">One of the trailers showed a bit of that scene too.</a>

LePetomane goes into the fake Rock Ridge and shakes hands with its cardboard "residents".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePresidentsAnalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePresidentsAnalyst">The President's Analyst</a></em> premiered on broadcast TV with two scenes that have since vanished: one where Dr. Schaefer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCoburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCoburn">James Coburn</a>) first meets love interest Nan (Joan Delaney) in a NYC art-movie theater - now she's first seen in bed with him. Later, as he checks to see whether or not he's paranoid thinking he's being watched by spies, he gets them to expose themselves, and finds Nan is a spy too - a missing scene has him hallucinating disembodied floating eyeballs, including two looming out from her face.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurderByDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurderByDeath">Murder by Death</a></em> had four scenes added for its network airing.

</li><li> Some tv versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins">Gremlins</a> include a scene where Billy and Kate encounter Billy's coworker Gerald hiding from the gremlins in a bank vault and revealing that they killed the manager.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetChristmasCarol">The Muppet Christmas Carol</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">Cut Song</a> called "When Love Is Gone". It was deleted from the theatrical release but included on TV reruns and the VHS release - but left off the DVD.

It also gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriumphantReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriumphantReprise">Triumphant Reprise</a> at the end called "When Love Is Found".
</li><li> ABC's airings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JingleAllTheWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JingleAllTheWay">Jingle All the Way</a></em> in the '90s and early '00s included several deleted scenes, notably a long monologue by Myron describing his favorite childhood action figure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PatGarrettAndBillyTheKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PatGarrettAndBillyTheKid">Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</a></em> was heavily cut in its original theatrical release. TV airings of the movie through the '70s and '80s (prior to the release of the Preview Cut) trimmed more explicit scenes of sex and violence, but often included incidental scenes (for instance, Dub Taylor and Elisha Cook Jr.'s cameos as aged prospectors) deleted from the original version to compensate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MagicAdventuresOfMumfie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MagicAdventuresOfMumfie">Mumfie's Quest</a></em> had a few cut scenes from when the movie was originally a set of episodes. Britt Allcroft has intents to bring these cuts back.
</li><li> The movie versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhCapsuleMonsters">Yu-Gi-Oh!: Capsule Monsters</a></em> had several scenes cut for time included as bonus features, which were restored in the episodic releases on the Season 5 DVDs.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> broadcast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRugratsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRugratsMovie">The Rugrats Movie</a></em> included two scenes that were cut from the theatrical and video releases - the first one is about Stu and Didi having a nightmare about Dr. Lipschitz, and the second had the Rugrats dragging the Reptar Wagon up a hill while singing to an army chant, the latter of which was included in the print novelization. Unfortunately, very few people watched the CBS broadcast, and these scenes are also not included on the DVD release. However, they have been retained in Nickelodeon's broadcasts of the film.
</li><li> The FX Network version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> has a couple of minor character scenes that aren't present in the final cut of the film, including a longer conversation between Peter and Mary-Jane outside his house where she admits that she's seeing J. Jonah Jameson's son and he laughs it off, that weren't present in the theatrical cut. Despite the "Spider-Man 2.1" cut being released with additional footage, the scenes in the FX version are nowhere to be found and haven't been officially released to date.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em> has examples of TV cut additions and a plothole-filled sequence:
<ul><li> When the film first aired on television (on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a>) in 1991, it included an extended sequence where the Marines use sentry guns to kill most of the xenomorphs while holed up in the Operations wing. The sequence was later used in the Director's Cut version, along with a sequence which shows Hadley's Hope before the attack.
</li><li> More importantly, a scene where Ripley finds an impregnated Burke in the alien hive wasn't released for many years until its inclusion on the <em>Alien Anthology</em> Blu-Ray set, largely due to Cameron's insistence that the scene was ridiculous and caused a plot hole.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous">Almost Famous</a></em> would have included a scene where William Miller and his parents listen to Led Zeppelin's <em>Stairway To Heaven</em>. <em>All ten-plus minutes of it</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kcgb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1kcgb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kcgb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's actually eight minutes long.</span> It was removed because of rights clearance issues with the band.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnchormanTheLegendOfRonBurgundy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnchormanTheLegendOfRonBurgundy">Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</a></em> is a very interesting example. There were so many deleted scenes and alternate takes left on the cutting room floor, including an alternate subplot involving a comically inept extremist organization called The Alarm Clock, that they were cobbled together into a straight-to-DVD faux-sequel called <em>Wake Up, Ron Burgundy.</em>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> episode "Potty Emergency" had a scene cut from the final broadcast and DVD version where a man watering flowers in the park turns his hose towards the camera, and Wakko acts squeamish at this sight. This version was only shown at an animation convention back in the 90's before the show's debut. However, there are reports that this scene was shown on Teletoon Retro broadcasts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow">Apocalypse Now</a></em>. The theatrical version runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes and the Redux version just over 3 hours. A never-released workprint of the film (featuring tons and tons of alternate and deleted shots, musical cues and much more) runs an astounding <strong>five-and-a-half hours</strong>. It comprises almost all the footage Francis Ford Coppola had shot in production, and can still be found circulating around the Internet (in very rough form).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAristocrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAristocrats">The Aristocrats</a></em>. Considering the nature of the film, some of the comedians filmed telling the titular joke are either edited out or included in shorter takes. One sadly cut for length is Kevin Pollak's telling of the joke in a restaurant using a spot-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertBrooks">Albert Brooks</a> impression.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">"Viking prologue"</a> from 2001's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AtlantisTheLostEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AtlantisTheLostEmpire">Atlantis: The Lost Empire</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em>'s extended special edition not only includes more scenes that the theatrically-released special edition, but also includes an extended opening sequence that shows in greater detail just how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> Earth has become. In the theatrical and original SE cuts, the Earth sequence basically consisted of little more than snippets from a scene that takes place in a morgue (which, with its rows of incinerators, bears greater resemblance to an industrial complex) where Jake, accompanied by a pair of representatives for Parker Selfridge's mining company, pays his last respects to his twin brother Tom.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> had several scenes:
<ul><li> One set of scenes expanded Cobie Smulders' character Maria Hill, and used her character as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> (via questioning after the battle in New York) to tell the events in question. It was shown she had been placed in SHIELD by the World Security Council to watch and report on Nick Fury. Part of the movie's climax was her decision to transfer her loyalty to Fury.
</li><li> There's an additional deleted scene showing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Steve Rogers</a> adjusting to the modern world, which includes running into the waitress who he ends up saving at the bank during the Battle of New York, plus a Stan Lee cameo wherein he implores Steve to ask the waitress out. This would've explained how the waitress recognized Cap when seeing him unmasked.
</li><li> During the final battle, there is also a long sequence showing how the aforementioned waitress got from the diner to the bank where she was being held as a hostage. She is assisted by a police officer who aids her in getting through the ravaged streets, but is shot by the Chitauri while helping her escape. This was likely cut for being filler.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> was reportedly cut severely down from its original length, with various scenes either being mentioned in pre-production interviews or added in later releases.
<ul><li> The June 2019 re-release of the film adds a deleted scene after the credits — the original introduction of "Professor" Hulk, who would be seen saving a group of residents from a burning building before Steve calls him. The scene also has incomplete CGI, and was cut for reasons of pacing.
</li><li> The third act originally featured a long sequence (described as "a film within a film") where various characters reunited during the final battle amid the ruins of the Avengers Headquarters and formed a plan to attack Thanos' army. This was cut on the basis that it would have padded out an already-long movie.
</li><li> Prior to release, Katherine Langford was cut in an unspecified role, and was present during reshoots. It was later revealed that she was cast as an adult version of Tony's daughter, Morgan, who would appear to him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just before his death, when he has a vision via the Soul Stone</span>. The scene was cut on the basis that it would have been too confusing for audiences, who wouldn't know who the woman talking to Tony was.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a>: Mask of Light</em>, they cut a quick scene of Takua stumbling over and losing his mask; a long scene in which Makuta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">references past stories</a> and creates his Rahkshi servants (it was too slow and would have revealed them too early); a shot of the blue Rahkshi stepping on a sports ball and breaking it (the production team apparentlyfeltit was too mea?); and several other brief shots that didn't impact the plot. Except for one that showed the first trio of Rahkshi escaping from the lake they'd been frozen in.
<ul><li> Three short bits from the final battle in <em>BIONICLE: The Legend Reborn</em> were storyboarded but cut from the end product: Gresh uniting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualTonfas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualTonfas">Dual Tonfas</a> to use as a surfboard, Kiina and a Bone Hunter acting out the famous "shoot the swordsman" scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em>, and Tarix punching a ridiculously overarmed and overgrown Skrall soldier. All three were cheap gags that didn't impact the story, though with their deletion, Tarix the champion fighter doesn't appear at all in the completed battle scene.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AChristmasStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AChristmasStory">A Christmas Story</a></em>, at least three of Ralphie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination">Mister Imagination</a> fantasy sequences were deleted to comply with MGM's 90 minute time limit for the movie. Screenplay fragments of these scenes <a class="urllink" href="http://www.Film/AChristmasStoryhouse.com/index.php/a-christmas-story-movie-facts/deleted-scenes/">are available here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> A fairly large amount of them were cut or only included in the trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015">Cinderella (2015)</a></em>.
<ul><li> The prologue with kid Ella was longer, with a scene of she and her mother saving a bird and her mother giving her a longer dying speech.
</li><li> Lady Tremaine's party towards the beginning was longer, with one guest making a sexist remark.
</li><li> A brief conversation between Tremaine and Ella ("What have you been doing?" "Dreaming." "Then wake up!") <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingTrailerScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingTrailerScene">was only in the trailers</a>.
</li><li> The dialogue during the fencing scene and ball announcement was shortened.
</li><li> The Fairy Godmother explaining the slippers would be a memento and thus not disappear.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9fDA0bYTiU">Ella and Kit having a longer conversation at the ball about their childhoods.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The Duke and Royal Guard question Ella after the spell is broken.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kit telling the Captain about his plan to disguise himself as a guard during the search for Ella.</span>
</li><li> A scene after the wedding (where the theatrical film ends).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheCrow">The Crow</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 1994 live-action adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrow">The Crow</a></em> featured an infamous deleted character: The Skull Cowboy, a spiritual mentor who would guide Eric Draven through his quest for vengeance. He only exists on a deleted scene in a workprint version giving Eric a clue before disappearing for good. The character's scenes were cut because they mirrored the circumstances of actor Brandon Lee's death too closely (the Skull Cowboy injures Draven during a fight scene). Plus, there's plenty of other deleted footage that has never officially been released, including an alternate guitar solo sequence (shot from behind) of Draven performing Hellfire (his guitar teacher was a stand-in for this scene).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrowCityOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrowCityOfAngels">The Crow: City of Angels</a></em> also featured several deleted scenes that were only released...as a bonus feature on the <em>official CD-Rom companion disc</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Divergent">Divergent</a></em> has several:
<ul><li> During the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage">Training Montage</a>, Peter brags about his shooting accuracy only to get put in his place by Four. The latter also ignores Tris when she asks for shooting advice. This adds a little more meaning to Tris's second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage">Training Montage</a> where Four does offer her advice - and it also explains why she is slightly cold to him when he does.
</li><li> The sequence involving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edward getting stabbed in the eye</span>. Tris goes to Four afterwards and he pretends to not care, but changes his tune as soon as he knows Eric isn't listening. This emphasises that the Dauntless rules are changing.
</li><li> Tris tries to comfort Al privately about his fear of being cut. He bluntly tells her "I just hate anyone who's better than me."
</li><li> The visiting day sequence where Natalie comes to see Tris, telling her to eat some chocolate cake for her. This segues to Max explaining how the fear training will work.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The commercially available cut of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E9TheTimeMeddler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E9TheTimeMeddler">The Time Meddler</a>" is restored from a poor quality 16mm telerecording found in Nigeria. The Nigerian censors removed a scene in the episode "Checkmate" in which two Vikings get stabbed to death for being too violent, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">no visuals of the scene are known to exist</a>. The soundtrack of the 'missing 12 seconds' does exist, and the DVD special features contain the audio, accompanied by portions of the script. The American syndication version of "The Time Meddler" cuts the scene in the first episode where Vicki finds Steven stowed away in the TARDIS, as it's a direct continuation of the previous story ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E8TheChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E8TheChase">The Chase</a>") which doesn't make much sense if you haven't seen that too.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E4Inferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS7E4Inferno">Inferno</a>" has a scene of the Doctor and the Brigade Leader listening to a radio broadcast talking about the apocalypse about to destroy the world. The scene was cut due to the fact that the radio announcer was played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a>, and although he was doing a 'voice' the director decided it was too obviously the same actor. Seeing as the plot involved a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> in which the Doctor is conspicuously absent, this had the potential to get extremely confusing, and the scene was ditched. It's still viewable on the DVD.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E2TheArkInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E2TheArkInSpace">The Ark in Space</a>":
<ul><li> Had a scene where, in the final stages of larval infestation, Noah's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">head splits open and cracks</a> in a torrent of acidic goo, that was cut because it was too graphic. There are conflicting reports on if the scene was ever filmed, and if it was, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">the scene was lost</a>. (Probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">for the best</a>.)
</li><li> A scene was filmed where Noah confronts Vira and begs her to kill him to end his agony, that Philip Hinchcliffe decided to cut as it was too dark. The scene as in the aired episode cuts from a shot of the Doctor looking on to a shot of him glowering and looking harrowed from a similar angle in a different room, with the door shut and no indication how they got away from Noah. Kenton Moore, who played Noah, expressed his opinion that he was furious about the scene going because it was crucial to the whole story. The missing scene is lost.
</li></ul></li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E1TerrorOfTheZygons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E1TerrorOfTheZygons">Terror of the Zygons</a>"'s TARDIS arrival scene was cut from the original broadcast and VHS versions due to difficulty getting the TARDIS splitscreen effect to work. This ends up leaving the Doctor inexplicably dressed in a tartan Tam-o'-shanter tracking something with a gadget. The scene was restored from black-and-white footage and recolourised for the DVD version, giving the Doctor time to explain that he's trying to locate UNIT with a receiver (and that he knows he's in Scotland <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircularReasoning">because he's dressed for Scotland</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EightCrazyNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EightCrazyNights">Eight Crazy Nights</a></em>, there was originally going to be a scene where Davey coaches the basketball team against prisoners. It involved a lot of cartoonish antics (including a scene where one of the kids is decapitated but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">gets better</a>), and at the end, they bring their secret weapon: a giant man named Hammer, who is knocked unconscious by a basketball to the face.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></em>, there was a scene where, after Elliot's frog-freeing antics, Elliot's mother meets with the school principal played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> had it removed, feeling Ford's presence was too distracting.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination">Final Destination</a></em> included deleted scenes with the original ending. The scenes have the hero sleep with his love interest, then get killed saving her. The baby she ends up giving birth to is how she considers he "cheated death", creating new life even though he died.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986">The Fly (1986)</a></em>:
<ul><li> After Ronnie tells Stathis she is pregnant, there was an entire reel of the film that ended up deleted, with an additional stage in Seth Brundle's transformation to boot. We see Seth working on his computer, looking much worse and also rather psychotic, as he calibrates the telepods to, as we come to find out, fuse together a cat and the surviving baboon. As he leans in to see what happened, a grotesque mutant with two heads and several limbs (half-cat, half-baboon) jumps out, scratches him on his (much bigger) bulge, and cowers behind a box, after which Seth kills it with a pipe. Right after, he climbs up to the roof and screams "No" repeatedly, until the bulge starts hurting him and a perfect insect limb comes out. Horrified, Seth works through the pain and bites it off, throwing it aside. As he looks on in a great deal of pain, it's <em>still twitching</em>...This reel was cut after the first test screening in Toronto because the audience lost all sympathy for Seth after he killed the mutant animal — that one audience member <em>vomited</em> didn't help — seeing it as working out his frustrations on the beast rather than, as intended, giving it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>.
</li><li> Following that was a scripted scene that was never filmed where Seth attacks and kills a bag-lady. It got as far as the casting stage for the extra needed, but again, the need to keep Seth sympathetic led to the sequence being cut.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>: The uncut episodes on DVD tend to have scenes that were cut not just for syndication, but also scenes that also didn't originally air due to content. One example is when Joey is angry at Chandler for making fun of the bracelet he gave him. When Chandler says he should focus on the fact Chandler wore it even though he hated it, Joey tells him to "focus on this" and grabs his junk while the camera cuts to behind Joey. Another extra sequence, in "TOW The Cheap Wedding Dress", seems to be an ad-lib from Matt LeBlanc: After a love interest ditches both Ross and Joey at a restaurant, Ross asks if Joey is hungry, to which Joey replies, "Does a bear shit in the woods?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em> was initially going to have a narration by a troll with a Brooklyn accent at the start of the film, explaining that a child is born with ice powers every 1,000 years during a Saturn alignment. It was decided not to include it because of questions it could raise about the rules of the magical nature of the world, and instead deciding to just state that Elsa was born with them in the film itself and explain the full circumstances later.
</li><li> The official full trailer for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GeorgeOfTheJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GeorgeOfTheJungle">George of the Jungle</a></em> movie includes a scene where the Tooky Tooky bird sits first class in a plane on his way to warn George about Ape's capture. Needless to say, this scene is not in the film — all we get is a brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a> that covers his flight (using his natural wings) from Africa to San Francisco.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> has had a few: two scenes from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E3TheTicketMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E3TheTicketMaster">The Ticket Master</a>", a minor shot from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E14SuitedForSuccess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E14SuitedForSuccess">Suited for Success</a>", and a major scene from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E4LunaEclipsed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E4LunaEclipsed">Luna Eclipsed</a>".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldenCompass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldenCompass">The Golden Compass</a></em>'s original final 20 minutes, which culminated in a downbeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a>, were cut when the studio decided it would be better to have it serve as the opening scenes of <em>The Subtle Knife</em>, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillbornFranchise">ultimately never produced</a>. This happened so late in production that <em>all</em> of the promotional stuff, including the trailer, includes it. Because the video game tie-in is closer to the film than the book, a lot of the lost footage (from when Lyra is reunited with Lord Asriel to when Lyra and Iorek split up) can be seen in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatGatsby2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatGatsby2013">The Great Gatsby (2013)</a></em> has three deleted scenes of Nick and Jordan's relationship. There is also an alternate ending which is the same as the book where Gatsby's father <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">attended his son's funeral</span> and where Tom meets Nick in New York, a few months later.
</li><li> Interestingly, the DVD of the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movie includes a deleted scene in which Sirius Black's attack on Gryffindor Tower is discussed. This attack occurred in the book, but was not in the film or in another deleted scene. Presumably, the entire sequence was removed before they would have filmed the actual attack, leaving us with a weird "orphaned" scene which would only make sense if paired with material that was never filmed. The same film also has an extra scene with the Knight Bus in which the blue screen wasn't edited out before it got removed and it's included as-is on the DVD. You can see both scenes, among others not in the film, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eBE8CttgvQ">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. There are also three others.
<ul><li> There are dozens of unreleased scenes from the eight movies whose existence have <em>not</em> gone unnoticed by fans, to the point where petitions have been made to release them. Some of these are quite glaring, such as an alternate ending to the fourth film in which the trio looks out over the maze, a scene from the fifth film of the brain room from the book, and the moment from the first book where Harry asks Dumbledore what he sees in the mirror of Erised.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyGilmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyGilmore">Happy Gilmore</a></em>, the orderly in the nursing home was a complete jerk who used everyone in it, including Happy's grandmother, for slave labor. A deleted scene shows that grandma mentioned what the orderly had been doing. He tries to talk his way out of it by claiming she is senile, and Happy pretends to go along with it, transitioning into the orderly being thrown out of a second story window similar to the fate of the IRS agent earlier in the movie. Naturally, all of the residents of the nursing home are very happy to see the orderly get what he's deserved.
<ul><li> There were also a couple of scenes that gave auto(The homeless man Happy hires as his caddy) more to do, including going through a minor arc involving becoming a better caddy. Likely cut in favor of just showing his change over time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou">Have I Got News for You</a></em>, and more recently <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI">QI</a></em>, have 'extended' versions of their episodes (usually about ten minutes longer) featuring content cut from the original broadcast.
<ul><li> Podcasts <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheBugle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheBugle">The Bugle</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Psycomedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Psycomedia">Psycomedia</a></em> both construct entire episodes out of such content, known as 'offal' and 'Frankenpodcasts' respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Here Comes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em>, while on his way to rescue Odie from the pound, Garfield encounters a female cat on a fence post and wonders what she's thinking about. The scene was apparently animated and voices were recorded but for whatever reason it was cut. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgMC6WVVLcU">The song accompanying the scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can be heard on the soundtrack.
</li><li> The "Humuhumunukunukuapua'a" number was deleted from the theatrical version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical2">High School Musical 2</a></em>, to avoid spilling the beans about Ryan's sexuality, but retained in the DVD release and stage adaptation.
</li><li> The trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> includes a very quick scene where Ellie reaches out during the initial Jeep ride from the helicopter to the visitor's center and plucks a leaf from a tree. This scene is not in the final cut of the movie. She just randomly has this leaf in her hand right before we see the first dinosaur, and she comments on it with no explanation how she got it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Laura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Laura">Laura</a></em> had a scene cut due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">Conspicuous Consumption</a> going against the spirit of rationing during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. To give an idea of how much, the scene included the eponymous Laura wearing several expensive outfits, including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutCape">pear decorated cape</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink">a mid-length fur skirt</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em>'s "balcony scene," an extended version of the sequence where General Allenby talks Lawrence out of resigning. When the movie was restored in 1989, the editors couldn't fit it into the existing film without damaging the continuity. There were also concerns that the actor dubbing Jack Hawkins' dialogue wasn't a convincing soundalike. This scene was included on the 2012 Blu-Ray release as a special feature.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaidIIReturnToTheSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaidIIReturnToTheSea">The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a> "Gonna Get My Wish" is cut.
</li><li> The extended editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> films had loads of these included. Better yet, there's even <em>more</em> footage that hasn't been released to date; it's mostly from the ending of the film (every character would have gotten their own epilogue).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask">The Mask</a></em>.

It was restored to TV and video versions in the 1980s.
</li><li> Episode 38 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em> originally began with a choreographed number on behalf of the Conservative and Unionist Party which is absent from most prints.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen">Mystery Men</a></em>, one of the deleted scenes on the DVD shows an alternate method of destroying Casanova Frankenstein's machine: rather than throw The Bowler's bowling ball into it, they were going to throw one of Dr. Heller's Tornado-in-a-Can into it. The effect for this can still however be seen in the theatrical release; just after they toss the bowling ball in and it does its damage you can see the green swirling smoke coming out of the hole.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> in Korean film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePresidentsLastBang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePresidentsLastBang">The President's Last Bang</a></em>. Korean censors ordered newsreel clips (of 1979 protests at the beginning, and President Park's funeral at the end) deleted. The film as released shows a black screen with titles noting that the scene was deleted due to orders from the government. The black screen stays up until the newsreels were supposed to end, after which the film starts, and later the credits roll at the end.
</li><li> <em>Rent</em> contains a prominent example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scene</a>; the director mentions in the commentary that a particular sequence (in which the antagonist and one of the protagonists mend fences and make ironic jokes) projected the wrong tone. The sequence was re-shot to maintain its dramatic impact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em>:
<ul><li> The DVD has the song "Superheroes" brought back to its full length - for those who have only seen the old American cut, the Criminologist's cryptic poem is the final stanza.
</li><li> "Once In A While" appeared on the 20th anniversary VHS, the 25th anniversary DVD, and the 35th anniversary Blu-Ray. None of these incorporated the scene into the movie, however - leaving fans to do their own editing.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the trailer for the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSantaClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSantaClause">The Santa Clause</a></em> includes a shot of Scott and another character conversing in front of a playroom, with Scott giving his acquaintance a big grin.
</li><li> Some television broadcasts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> cut out an entire flashback sequence where Mystery Inc. kicks Scrappy-Doo off the team, likely so as not to broadcast the seconds-long sequence where Scrappy urinates on Daphne's cleavage to "mark his territory," which is the reason he's thrown out (along with his general obnoxiousness). Unfortunately, this scene's removal for TV broadcasting also results in the removal of a key plot point that helps a later scene in the film to make more sense, namely, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Scrappy's desire for revenge for that unceremonious ousting motivating his role as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span>.
</li><li> The movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> had a director's cut which added more scenes, making the film even more faithful to its source.
</li><li> The various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> films had large chunks taken out in post-production, some of which was restored via director's cuts or extended versions:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">Spider-Man</a></em> has a number of deleted subplots and scenes, including the infamous "World Trade Center web" trailer that was reportedly cut from the film after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Likewise, there were deleted scenes from early trailers and story descriptions (including a sequence of Peter building mechanical webshooters, which was seen on a trailer that debuted at E3 2001 and a reported cameo by Eddie Brock, who was played by a minor actor) that still haven't been officially released.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> had so much deleted content that it was eventually released in an extended version called <em>Spider-Man 2.1</em>. Even then, there's a TV version that has additional scenes that weren't included in the 2.1 cut (including Mary Jane flippantly telling Peter that she's got a boyfriend while they're talking outside his house).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3">Spider-Man 3</a></em> had boatloads of footage cut prior to release, with much of it only being seen in trailers or early screenings. This included more subplots like Sandman's quest to cure his daughter's sickness, an alternate scene of Eddie Brock joining forces with Sandman while the latter is playing with his daughter at a park, a sequence where a distraught Mary Jane speaks to Peter about Harry in his apartment just before she's kidnapped, and much more footage of Peter taking out criminals in the symbiote costume (and being confronted by a nightmarish reflection in his mirror). Some scenes make an appearance in <em>Spider-Man 3: Editor's Cut</em>. The reason Harry's butler waited until <em>3</em> to explain how he knew Norman's death was an accident was because a deleted scene showed that he was a hallucination, which fills a major plot gaffe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> had a few scenes cut that didn't really add much to the plot and probably dragged on too long. Other deleted scenes, however, would have added a <em>lot</em> of characterization and depth: Connors begging Peter to help him after the fight in the school, afraid the police will kill him (and Peter, after clear hesitation, doing so); Connors talking to his son. There was also an extensive scene that featured Peter and Connors talking the sewers, with Connors asking Peter if <em>he</em>'d give up his power and Peter realizing they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>. It also would have clarified what happened to Ratha: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Lizard bit his head off.</span> Most of this scene was fully rendered, implying it was cut very late in production. Part of it still appears in the theatrical release but it has been re-cut in such a way to remove Peter, making it seem like Connors is talking to himself.
</li></ul></li><li> The initial television broadcast of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em> movie included deleted scenes never seen before. These included the fleshing out of Peter Preston and more scenes with Saavik, among others.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> has a few of these.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> had a few interesting deleted scenes. One was a simple lab scene where Obi-Wan analyzes the poison dart he got from the bounty hunter. It was deleted because they realized it didn't move the plot "We didn't know anything going in and we knew nothing going out" and a simple mention of it in a later scene was enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> cut out a few scenes that detailed the Senators who openly opposed Palpatine, who would go on to be prominent members of the Rebel Alliance. They deleted it mostly because it was just a few token scenes in an office, and it interrupted the flow of the real meat of the story (the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> and Anakin's fall).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> had scenes on Tatooine in which Luke first observes the hunting of Leia's spaceship with a telescope, then goes to tell his buddies about it, after which they discuss whether it would be worth to join the rebels. Leaving these scenes in would have explained why Luke was talking to some of the rebel pilots he meets later as if they were friends of his - they were, in fact! The scene where Han is confronted by Jabba the Hutt before leaving Tatooine was originally cut, but restored in the Special Edition with a CGI makeover.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> has a deleted scene during the Hoth escape. The scene takes place while Han, Leia, and Threepio are running through the snowy hallways fleeing from incoming Imperial snowtroopers. Threepio, in a moment of almost sadistic brilliance, pauses for a moment to tear a sign off a door before hurring away. The sign reads "DANGER! WAMPAS!" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wingdinglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wingdinglish">Aurebesh</a>, and naturally the Imperials that come onto the scene investigate the door. One of the snowtroopers opens the door, whereupon a Wampa arm reaches out, grabs an unlucky snowtrooper, and yanks him into the room. The first startled snowtrooper hurriedly locks the door back back shut while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOnlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundOnlyDeath">horrible sounds ensue</a> and the remaining two snowtroopers can only listen through the door. Darth Vader actually happens on the scene, takes one look at the extremely sheepish snowtrooper who opened the door in the first place, and says nothing before walking off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> had several that gave some depth to Moff Jerjerrod, not to mention more showcasing just how evil Palpatine was. Long story short, Palpatine ordered for Jerjerrod to fire the superlaser on Endor should the Death Star's shield be deactivated, an order that Jerjerrod reluctantly attempted to obey (it's obvious that his reluctance is because several of their men will be killed in the blast). It was apparently cut for time purposes, although it was retained in the Novelization, and was also included in the Blu-Ray releases' special features.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap">This is Spın̈al Tap</a></em> is possibly the king of deleted scenes. Between the Criterion DVD, MGM DVD, and bootlegged workprint, nearly FIVE HOURS of deleted scenes are in circulation, featuring truckloads of bad language, explicit drug use, male and female nudity, countless forgotten subplots, Nigel being racist and even a wealth of material leading up to Derek having the cucumber in his pants. Oh yes, and a total of ten minutes in which nothing happens but Tommy Pischedda (Bruno Kirby) telling stories about Sinatra.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> had several deleted scenes that, until the release of the special edition DVD set, could only be seen during the A&amp;E syndicated airings of the show. They included many character moments cut for pacing, as well as an extended shootout in the final episode between Jack and the Drazen brothers.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne">The Vision of Escaflowne</a></em> was first aired in Japan, Sunrise made too much animated content for the show's earlier episodes to fit in it's TV time slot. As a result, some scenes having nothing to do with the advancement in the show's plot had to be cut for time. The deleted scenes were restored in Japanese video releases. Said deleted scenes have not made it to the US DVDs, even in the 2009 re-release for some reason, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">No Export for You</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> director's cut edition restores twenty-four minutes of scenes cut for time. As the full version is over three hours, it's really easy to see why.
</li><li> There's 20 minutes of footage left out of the final cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfman2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfman2010">The Wolfman (2010)</a></em> that is featured on the DVD. For example, there's a scene where Wolfman!Lawrence bursts into a masquerade ball during his London rampage and then proceeds to kill and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSplatteredInnocents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSplatteredInnocents">splatter blood on the guests</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie">It was in the trailers</a>, but didn't make it into the theatrical release.
</li><li> Though most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> deleted scenes were cut for time reasons and have little bearing on the plot, there are quite a few deleted scenes ad-libbed by David and Gillian that couldn't be included without taking the "U" out of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">UST</a>. There are at least three deleted kisses, two of which can be seen on Youtube.
<ul><li> One of the deleted kisses (the infamous hallway kiss from <em>Fight the Future</em>) seems to have been a joke played on the actors. It was finally released 10 years after the movie came out, presumably in anticipation of the 2008 movie, which naturally caused fans to squee and faint dead away. When interviewed about this deleted scene, Frank Spotnitz said that "Nobody ever called 'cut'" and so the scene proceeded as is. There are definitely other takes of the hallway scene in which David and Gillian are clearly messing around and hamming it up for the camera, however.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1963 adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheFlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheFlies">Lord of the Flies</a></em> had a scene from the original book with Ralph and Jack that was cut from the final release. It can be viewed in the DVD release of the 1963 adaptation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls  Friendship Games</a></em> had an entire subplot lopped out and changed. The subplot would have had Sunset Shimmer angsting about returning to Equestria. She would have wrote to Princess Twilight Sparkle for advice (who would help her instead of leaving her hanging due to the events of "The Cutie Re-Mark") and have a duet with the Human Twilight Sparkle. The ending would have had Sunset deciding to stay as the Human Twilight Sparkle returned to Crystal Prep, her former tormentors becoming her new friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em> has a deleted scene where Mr. Orange gets briefed on the past of Larry Dimmick/Mr. White. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> cut it because he felt it spoiled the audience too early. If left in the scene would have broken the film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromosomeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromosomeCasting">Chromosome Casting</a>, as Orange is briefed by a female detective played by Nina Siemaszko.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Help" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Help">Help!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Footage for a few deleted scenes has been floating around. One of the most prominent ones is for a scene in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> attend The Sam Ahab School of Transcendental Elocution. While there, they, Sam Ahab, and another student known as "Lady Macbeth" are hypnotized by the cult's "Go to the Window" music, except for George, who was wearing earplugs. They try to chop off Ringo's hand while most of the room is in a trance, but George knocks the axe (!!!) they were using out of their hands and into a mirror. The cult flees and everyone wakes up to see the axe left behind. The scene ends with John removing the axe and asking Lady Macbeth "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Is this a chopper</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">that you see before you?</a>". This scene would have explained why Ringo withdrew his hand so quickly the next time they tried to cut it off, as well as how the boys knew to plug their ears in the Scotland Yard scene.
</li><li> One scene cut from the movie had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a>, disguised as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a>, sitting in a treehouse.
</li><li> A scene cut from the film was to have been within the attempts to kill Ringo, (within the five attempts), it involved Ringo making a phone call in a phone box, and a blotched sacrifice attempt made within the phone box.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Riddick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Riddick">Riddick</a></em>: There was a scene removed from the theatrical version that continues after Riddick escapes the planet where he goes back to the Necromongers to find that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was Krone who really betrayed him, and Vaako has crossed into the Underverse.</span> It was restored in the extended cut.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildThings">Wild Things</a></em>: Several scenes were not included in the film, including one that expands on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suzie</span>'s motives for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> scheme: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's actually an unacknowledged heir to the Van Ryan estate. Sandra Van Ryan's late father was an adulterous philanderer with a love of hookers, meaning Suzie is Sandra's half-sister. Of course, this makes her seducing Sandra's daughter Kelly a lot more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> in hindsight as well, which is probably why it ended up being cut.</span>
</li><li> The ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a>" episode "Just One Bite" was originally aired with a scene where Squidward sneaks into the Krusty Krab and finds out that their security is a bucket of gasoline that's set on fire (two in fact). This was presumably because it was deemed imitable.

<ul><li> For a book example, many deleted chapters of Arthur C. Clarke's novel <em>2001</em> (which was written concurrently with the movie) appear in <em>The Lost Worlds of 2001</em>, which also talks about the process of creating the book and movie.
</li><li> The Death Row scene in <em>The Adding Machine</em> was omitted until a 1956 revival restored it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</a></em> contained a scene that was to be featured before the second boss. It featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Sorceress</a> berating Bianca for failing to kill Spyro, then creating Spike to finish him. It can still be viewed on the Platinum edition of the game, as well as by inputting a code in the original.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BabesInToyland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BabesInToyland">Babes in Toyland</a></em>, the elaborately staged prologue was dropped when the original production spawned a smaller touring company; most revivals after Herbert's death continued to omit the prologue.
</li><li> Even theme park attractions are prone to this, as the former <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/BackToTheFutureTheRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/BackToTheFutureTheRide">Back to the Future: The Ride</a></em> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios">Universal Studios</a> had a slightly longer ending scene, in which Biff Tannen once again gets covered in manure; but was cut as the ride's producers felt that the gag was too forced. The unaltered ending can be seen in the ride's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kdU1IVY-Y">rough draft footage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The 2013 West End musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em> originally opened with an animated short designed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a>'s regular illustrator Quentin Blake, "Creation Overture", that whimsically depicted the making of a chocolate bar. It was dropped upon the show's first major cast turnover in 2014, for reasons unknown (possibly pacing, or even not wanting to rerecord the narration provided by Douglas Hodge, the first actor to play the role of Willy Wonka).
</li><li> For pacing reasons, the 2010 touring production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> dropped the battle between the villagers and the Enchanted Objects, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">two of the Broadway production's songs</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow">The Goon Show</a></em> often overran and had to be cut for timing purposes. Curiously, in the case of a few episodes, the timing cuts in the broadcast versions were omitted from transcription versions, although these had other timing cuts, and so where the broadcast and transcription versions both survive it has been possible to restore all of the cut parts for CD release.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>A Blink of the Screen</em>, the collection of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s short stories, includes at the back a deleted scene from "The Sea and Little Fishes", which was taken out at the advice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSilverberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSilverberg">Robert Silverberg</a> (who edited the <em>Legends</em> anthology where the story first appeared) for slowing everything down. It later got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefittedForSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefittedForSequel">reworked</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em>. (It also got mentioned in <em>Josh Kirby: A Cosmic Cornocopia</em>, explaining why Josh's first cover illustration for <em>Legends</em> wasn't used — he'd gone for that scene.)
</li><li> Two deleted scenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RaisingSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RaisingSteam">Raising Steam</a></em> were compiled into a little book presented at the 2014 Discworld Convention. One involves Moist trying to find water for the engine and stumbling into a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> parody, the other a dwarf writing an angry letter to the <em>Times</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> TV series are subject to deleted scenes for much the same reasons as set out for films in the introduction, and just as with film sometimes the restoration of said scenes resolve plot holes. Other reasons for deleted scenes to exist:
<ul><li> A series is produced for cable/streaming in one part of the world, but airs on a commercial broadcaster elsewhere, necessitating the removal of scenes with an unacceptable amount of sexual content or violence. (Examples of this include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bitten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bitten">Bitten</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vikings">Vikings</a></em>).
</li><li> A series is produced for broadcast on both commercial and non-commercial broadcasters, resulting in deleted scenes existing from the perspective of viewers of the former. A recent example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victoria">Victoria</a></em> which has scenes included in the non-commercial American PBS showing that were deleted from the commercial UK broadcast.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged">Dragon Ball Z Abridged</a></em> occasionally uploads "Alternate Takes", which are sometimes this, and othertimes throwaway jokes that wouldn't fit into the actual episode's continuity. Episode 51's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">stinger</a>, especially, is an alternate take where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Krillin accidentally kills Android 18</span>, something that would have ended the arc right there and then.
</li><li> The Paramount DVD release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy">Ren &amp; Stimpy</a> season 2 has a couple scenes cut from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RenAndStimpy2x09TheGreatOutdoorsTheCatThatLaidTheGoldenHairball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RenAndStimpy2x09TheGreatOutdoorsTheCatThatLaidTheGoldenHairball">The Cat that Laid the Golden Hairball</a>. They feature extended scenes of hairball production and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeCloseUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeCloseUp">Extreme Close-Up</a> of Stimpy's belly getting licked naked. The reasons why they were deleted are not apparent.
</li><li> An In-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CentralPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CentralPark">Central Park</a></em>, Season 1 "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CentralParkS1E9LiveItUpTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CentralParkS1E9LiveItUpTonight">Live It Up Tonight</a>". Zoom sings "Zoom's Home Alone 2 Deleted Scenes Tour" and "Rated Hard PG, for Spookiness" where he sings about the deleted scenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone">Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</a></em> (which probably didn't happen in real life) and why they were deleted.
