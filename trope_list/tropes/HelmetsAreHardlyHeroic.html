In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> the helmet is the most important piece of personal armor ever invented besides the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">shield</a>, since the skull and brain are highly vulnerable to all kinds of weapon blows and projectiles. In an ancient shield formation, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">large shield</a> would usually protect your torso but leave your head sticking over the top, thus inviting the slings, arrows, swords, and spears of the enemy. In modern ranged combat you have to expose your head every time you peek out of your trench or foxhole, and all kinds of debris and shrapnel from explosions might fall on your head. Clearly, helmets are a good idea. So why does a character who has access to a helmet rarely use it?
</p><p>In visual media this is usually the creators bowing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">Rule of Perception</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMoney">Shoot the Money</a>. Even an open-faced helmet will at least obscure a character's hair. Hairstyles can be important for identifying a character in a crowd, especially in animated works with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">Only Six Faces</a>. A fully enclosed or visored helmet can be an even bigger problem because people are good at recognizing faces, and associate faces with having individuality and personhood. A person without a face is dehumanized and treated as expendable by way of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">Faceless Goons</a> trope, which is no good for a character whom you want the audience to care about. In film and television, both the director and the actor will want the audience to see their facial expressions as the heart of their performance. It defeats the purpose of hiring a famous and probably good-looking actor or actress if you're going to make them harder to recognize. Also, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfDiminishingDefensiveEffort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfDiminishingDefensiveEffort">The Law of Diminishing Defensive Effort</a>, less armour implies a character is skilled enough not to <em>need</em> it.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Alternately, the armor the main character wears might not be distinctive enough to make him stand out from other people wearing armor; we wouldn't want to lose track of our hero among the Faceless Goons, after all. Writers and artists often try to alleviate this by giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform">main characters almost, but not quite the same uniform as</a> the Faceless Goons  or cheat by giving the hero a helmet, but one that shows their face clearly, while everyone else wears a full face helmet. When this is used to distinguish someone from an identical group of mooks, it's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniformityException" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniformityException">Uniformity Exception</a>. Real life battlefield recognition solutions adopted by armored warriors such as knights and samurai included elaborate helmet crests; heraldic colors on shields, surcoats, or horse trappings; armors decorated with etching, inlay, appliqué ornaments, heat/chemical bluing, paint, lacquer, or textile covering; and all kinds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a>. Often, fiction will not take full advantage of these options. Also, curiously enough, this trope is especially common for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarqueeAlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarqueeAlterEgo">superheroes</a> even though almost all of them <em>do</em> have a completely unique costume that would be instantly recognizable even if the wearer's face werent visible.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A variation is that when modern characters are depicted in boxing or martial arts training, they will rarely be shown wearing padded headgear that would generally be mandatory.
</p><p>And in video games where you can customize your character's appearance, wearing a helmet will often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConcealedCustomization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConcealedCustomization">obscure it and waste all the effort you put into it.</a>
</p><p>This may be justified in certain situations. Helmets can be somewhat heavy and restrictive, so a person who relies on keen vision, hearing, or freedom of movement might prioritize those things over the protection a helmet provides. Helmets are also bulky and awkward to carry when not being worn, so a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a>-type hero is also likely to forego them for the long haul. A character who starts out with a helmet might discard it after it becomes too damaged to use, but this might invite the question of why they don't look for a replacement. In any case, there's still little excuse not to use one in open battle, especially when characters go through the trouble of armoring every part of their body <em>except</em> for the head.
</p><p>On a related note, in virtually every superhero movie in which the main character wears a mask, it will be pulled off during the climax of the movie. Usually it's torn off or so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenFaceplate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenFaceplate">badly damaged</a> that there's no point in keeping it on; sometimes the hero just decides to take it off.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet">Cool Helmet</a> (where the helmet enhances the hero's image) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyHelmetEnforcement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyHelmetEnforcement">Fantasy Helmet Enforcement</a> (where the hero is setting a safety-conscious good example). Also contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBareheaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBareheaded">Never Bareheaded</a> (in which the heroic character is never shown without a helmet on his head) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureHeadgear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureHeadgear">Signature Headgear</a> (when the hero's distinctive helmet makes them stand out).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> For someone who wears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourArmor">24-Hour Armor</a>, Guts doesn't seem to like helmets. It's possible he either feels it wouldn't help or has trouble seeing out of them with only one eye. Ironically, one of the few times we ever see him wearing a helmet, it ends up saving his life, albeit shattering in the process. Whenever Guts does wear his helmet it usually gets struck off in the midst of battle (albeit saving his life in the process), while during the Hundred Man Fight he boldly throws it away himself midway through as if to show that he's about to get serious. How else would we see his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">beautiful battle smile</a>? Perhaps terrifyingly averted when Guts obtains the Berserker Armor, which includes a Hellhound-shaped Helmet that only appears when Guts is in an uncontrollable fury... Basically, see Guts' face; you may be OK. See the Helmet; kiss your ass goodbye. However, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he learns to keep it under control with Schierke's help</span> he keeps the helmet on but his face is shown in some scenes by only drawing the outline of the helmet.
</li><li> Furthermore, everyone who was part of the Band of the Hawk stopped wearing helmets altogether after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they won the Hundred Year War for Midland, Guts left, Griffith had a breakdown and got arrested, and the rest of the Hawks became fugitives</span> although they all continued to wear the rest of their armor.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>, Laios, Kabru and Shuro (two knights and a samurai, respectively) all wear full armor below the neck but lack helmets.
</li><li> It usually doesn't last long in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> before the main heroes start losing their helmets early in the battle for the rest of the arc.
<ul><li> Of all the Gold Saints, only two <em>always</em> wear their helmets: Aldebaran, who has a reputation as a jobber, and the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> Deathmask.
</li></ul></li><li> Even though it's <em>part of his body</em>, Greed of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> hardly ever uses his Ultimate Shield on his head. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explicitly because</a> he doesn't like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">the way it makes his face look</a>.
</li><li> Some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor">Barrier Jackets</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleBallgown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleBallgown">have actual armor on them</a>, but even those never have helmets unless they're being used by mooks. Justified by the fact that Barrier Jackets protect the entire body regardless of what's covered, a helmet would just block their peripheral vision.
</li><li> Erza of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> has many, many suits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor">Instant Armor</a>. Though most have some sort of headwear, only <em>one</em> has an actual helmet (fittingly, it's also the one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">that is purely defensive in nature</a>), and even that one doesn't actually cover her face. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, because she's wearing <em>magic</em> armor. Some suits protect her from magic attacks while others boost her physical abilities and yet others give her different magical abilities to work with. So, the helmet is decorative. As are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">legplates, armbands</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage">a chestpiece</a> sometimes...
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DesertPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DesertPunk">Desert Punk</a></em>: pretty much everyone wears desert suits with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet">Cool Helmets</a> whenever their traveling or are in combat, main characters included. However, Kanta semi-frequently loses use of his entire suit, generally before doing something incredibly badass (like disabling a <em>tank</em> by himself, with a shotgun). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">Junko</a>, out of shear vanity, wears her suit's helmet only when absolutely necessary.
</li><li> Justified in a flashback in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> where Saito shows how he first met The Major, where initially her, Batou and Ishikawa are all wearing the white UN Peacekeeper helmets until he starts sniping them, at which point they remove them. It's justified because the stark white of the helmets is actually endangering them by making them easier to see, the former two are full-body cyborgs, and they find out firsthand that the helmets might as well be tissue paper when faced with a high-velocity round when Saito takes out several of their helmeted comrades.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Discussed at the end of the Soul Society arc. In the middle of the arc, the helmet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">Captain Komamura</a> always wore is broken in battle by Captain Zaraki. He'd been trying to hide the shame of being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">anthropomorphic wolf</a> instead of human. However, once everyone learns the truth, they accept him on the grounds that wearing helmets make a person come across as untrustworthy whereas showing his face makes him seem honest and therefore reliable - good guys don't wear helmets, only people who are up to no good hide their faces.
</li><li> In episode 12 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AntiMagicAcademyThe35thTestPlatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AntiMagicAcademyThe35thTestPlatoon">Anti-Magic Academy: The 35th Test Platoon</a></em>, for the final battle Takeru loses the face-concealing helmet he normally wears in his Witch Hunter form.
</li><li> Exploited in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavyObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavyObject">Heavy Object</a></em>. Cameras in Object cockpits record the Elites during combat for propaganda videos and since a helmet would make them look less heroic they don't have any. Since the majority of military development is spent on Objects and their Elites this means that air force pilots have the same system and so no helmets or oxygen masks.
</li><li> Ryuuko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GroundControlToPsychoelectricGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GroundControlToPsychoelectricGirl">Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl</a></em> is considered unusual for wearing a helmet while riding her bicycle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nekki Basara of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross 7</a></em> never even bothers to wear any pilot suit at all, he just sorties with whatever clothes he's wearing at the time which is usually his live show outfit. Speaking of which, in one episode it does seem to be able to turn into a functional space suit with helmet and everything for extra-vehicular situations, but after it served its plot purpose of allowing Basara to float in space outside his VF while stuff happened, the helmet along with the space suit mode were never seen again.
</li><li> And the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta">Macross Delta</a></em>, Hayate Immelmann, outright refuses to use a helmet, since he feels constrained by both its physical presence and the flight-support AI it enables. His VF-31 had to be customized to take that into account.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer">Goblin Slayer</a></em>, from the series of the same name, subverts this trope to the point of parody. He wears his helmet (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourArmor">and the rest of his armor</a>) almost all of the time, only taking it off for maintenance or when he sleeps in the safety of home. It reflects his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a> attitude towards being attacked by goblins. He's somehow capable of even <em>eating and drinking</em> through the slits of his helmet. Ironically, even though his face is never shown to the audience, he nevertheless has a distinctive appearance because of his helmet and armor. Other characters in the series tend to play this trope straight.

His helmet is not worn for most of the story. It's seen in two panels: a <em>distant</em> shot of him attacking the bad guy has him wearing it. The very next panel, a closer shot as he speaks, has the helmet in the process of being knocked away, leaving his face mostly uncovered in that panel.

(These days, though, Mags' outfit doesn't change no matter how nice he's playing.)

</li><li> A weird example in the Star Wars <em>Empire</em> arc covering the Imperial backstory of Biggs Darklighter that somehow averts and plays the trope straight at the same time. Instead of the faceless TIE helmets seen in the movie, Biggs, Hobbie, and other main characters in the arc wear a helmet where we can see their faces while piloting their fighters. These helmets are never seen again in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a> continuity.

He dutifully wears it for combat, even though it's awkwardly heavy, restricts his vision, and looks stupid on him. (It's exactly the kind of horned helmet available at the beginning of the game.) After it gets dangerously in his way a couple of times, he finally discards it and never wears one again, relying instead on his speed and reflexes (and the author being nice about not letting him get hit on the head). It's mentioned he envies Khalid's much lighter helmet, which is seen on his character portrait in the game.

As in the comics, Dredd himself is never seen without his helmet (save for the opening scene, which shows him dressing for work. Since he's only depicted from behind and in shadow, his face is still not visible). The more idealistic (and female) rookie he's mentoring, however, eschews a helmet entirely.

The men of Laketown don't even seem to wear armor, so they might not have any. Thorin and company put on helmets and heavy armor when prepping for a siege, but stick to light armor instead when they go out to fight to not be worn out by the weight, and may have abandoned the helmets for the same reason. Dain starts with a helmet, but loses it. Given that without he can still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead">headbutt</a> Orcs who <em>do</em> have helmets, he arguably doesn't need one.

Not only does he opt not to wear his helmet, he takes off <em>all his armour</em>, saying he "can't breathe with it on." You won't breathe if you take it off either, Will, <em>because you will be dead.</em> In the commentary, the director talks about the convenience of cutting from the actor slamming down their visor to the stunt man in full armor and helmet.

The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> series generally averts this with Tony keeping his faceplate down in most situations, but makes up for it by inter-cutting shots of Tony's face from inside the helmet in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsUpDisplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsUpDisplay">Heads-Up Display</a>, which still allows him to emote and react to what's happening. Ditto for Rhodey.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>, Black Panther's helmet has to be manually removed whenever he wants to show his face.

The suits Iron Man makes for himself and Spider-Man in <em>Infinity War</em> have the same advantage.
</li><li> Although he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">not a hero</a> (unless you see him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">the main character of the movie</a>), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Infinity War</a></em> was widely mocked online for the fact that Thanos <em>never</em> wears his iconic golden helmet - or any armor at all, for that matter - when actually fighting, sticking with a sleeveless shirt and going for a bareheaded look that some fans described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">"high school gym coach" or "your fat uncle on casual Friday at work".</a>

Then when all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">resurrected heroes</a> who died in <em>Infinity War</em>, none of whom are anywhere near as tough or durable as Thanos, arrive on that same battlefield, they <em>also</em> immediately remove their helmets, and are rarely seen wearing them in the ensuing battle outside of landscape shots.

They discover the iconic sky-blue helmets are flimsy plastic and provide about as much protection as a cloth beret, so they choose not issue them (actual, real helmets, like the steel M1, came years later as armies started switching to composites such as kevlar).
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman">Snow White and the Huntsman</a></em>.

The Clone troopers in the prequel trilogy are an outlier in terms of wearing face-covering helmets despite being both competent at fighting and initially on the "good" side; after Order 66 you never see a clone trooper take off their helmet, and their successors the Storm Troopers are for the most part disposable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">Faceless Goons</a>.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em>: all pilots do wear helmets, but none of the named characters ever have their sun-visors down over their eyes while flying (not even "by the book" pilots such as Jester or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Viper</span>). Conversely, the helmets of all the unnamed MiG pilots cover the entire head.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willow">Willow</a></em>, Madmartigan dons a full suit of armor complete with helmet in preparation for the battle of Tir Asleen, only to lose the helmet about a minute into the fighting, and never bothers to retrieve or replace it.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries">X-Men</a></em> movies are rather infamous for making sure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman">Hugh Jackman</a> never wears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>'s iconic mask/helmet from the comics.

He regrets this later because the material of the suit does provides protection against magic, and when under mental attack he's reduced to shoving his arms in front of his head to get more of it between his enemy and himself.

</li><li> Earlier in that same battle Tyrion reprimands the king for raising his visor, for fear he'll get an arrow in his eye. The king is not expected to fight (and in fact is too cowardly to do so) but if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy">he is killed morale will be destroyed</a> (not to mention the Queen Regent will be really pissed off at Tyrion).
</li><li> Ser Barristan chooses not to wear his helmet on one occasion, because he's expecting to be in tight quarters with many side passages, and considers retaining peripheral vision more important than the protection.

In interviews the actor, Colin Baker, revealed that this was not so much directly because of this trope as because when he was wearing the helmet the plumage was too tall for the doorways and he would have to awkwardly duck under the doorheaders on every entrance, so he carried the helmet instead. During taping he decided that the helmet was a chicken named Esmerelda.

He only removes it when he thinks they've won, which turns out to be a mistake when he is wounded in the face during a counterattack. George has noted at other times that it does get his goat, but on the other hand it's TV, and you have to see the actors.

</li><li> Also lampshaded at the end of "Redemption, Part 2", when newly minted SG-1 member Jonas Quinn shows up with a helmet and Carter tells him to lose it. O'Neill gestures no, which is probably because he gave it to Jonas to make him look silly in the first place.

Even in battle scenes, the helmets are off far too often. Also, most of the models of officers and HQ units in <em>Warhammer 40000</em> lack helmets by default, and the few who do have helmets are usually painted in a different colour or has a different design from those of regular troops. It's justified because it makes the models easier to spot by the players, but for the same reason it would be a rather bad idea in an actual battlefield. The lack of helmets is exploited in one piece of flavour text, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel Straken</a> kills a Chaos Lord by laying in ambush and attacking him from behind when he removes his helmet.
<ul><li> One likely reason the helmets come off so easily is so GW's modelers can show off all the exquisitely-detailed faces they have to paint on a regular basis.
</li><li> Also, Space Marines are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">genetically-engineered</a> and conditioned/made to have <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">tough skeletons</a>, so going without a helmet is not quite as stupid for a Marine as it is for a human. It is still pretty stupid, though.
</li><li> Occasionally arises in the new background, such as the Vorlinghast's Bane story, where the Space Marines sent to cleanse the planet were infected by the warp plague affecting the planet's populace — but only the ones who did not have helmets. The ones who wore full armour were not affected, as they had a completely sealed environment.
</li><li> Another of the justifications, for the Space Wolves, is that much of their method of fighting as well as communication between each other is derived from their amazing senses of smell and hearing (Even compared to other marines), and producing helmets with auto-senses precise enough to avoid losing information is incredibly challenging<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ejvf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ejvf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ejvf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">So much so that, in the case of smell, the few helmets that are modified to allow them to take advantage of their senses just use a small air chamber which takes in small amounts of the surrounding air when needed.</span>. Also justified among the Space Wolves because they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Space Vikings</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">with all that implies</a> - it's not enough to just <em>say</em> you killed an alien beast the size of a tank in single combat, <em>somebody has to see you do it</em>.
</li><li> As far as the actual tabletop models go, almost every race has a lot of basic troops with helmets, where squad leaders and commanders and tank crew almost never wear them. That said, they will <em>usually</em> give you enough helmets to give the sergeant/commander a helmet as well, though thanks to WYSIWYG rules you normally have to paint the sergeant's helmet a different color or otherwise make him more ornamental.
</li><li> Exploited by a <em>White Dwarf</em> article about inclement battlefield conditions, with an acid cloud that affected any model with exposed skin, specifically calling out all those un-helmented commanders and sergeants.
<ul><li> Also handwaved in one novel, where it is stated that one of the first things that breaks down irreparably on a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> is the air scrubber, so anyone wearing a helmet will be caught in the smell of a couple of thousand years worth of stale farts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">and since officer and hero armour often is some kind of ancient relic...</a>
</li><li> Justified also because the Commander almost always has a melee weapon such as a Chainsword which leave enough of a mess on your armor so as to make wearing a helmet difficult because of the gore obstructing your already limited vision.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Although</a> getting that gore in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">your eyes</a> probably isn't much better...

</li><li> Exploited in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Prospero Burns</a></em>. The main character gets many headshots since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpaceWolf">Space Wolves</a> are rather... dim on helmet policies. Hell, instead of wearing good old fashioned ceramite helmets, they wore leather masks that are shaped like a wolf head. See, up until this point Space Marines, and Space Wolves in particular, were deployed as intimidation-based shock troops rather than special-operations precision eliminators, and the Space Wolves were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">expecting an enemy Space Marine planet to be vulnerable to the same tactics</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, in the other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, neither the Empire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knights of White Wolf</a> nor Bretonnian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Knights Errant</a> wear helmets.

Exact wording in the rulebook puts fancy helmet on the same level of importance as a good hairdo — purely cosmetic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, helmets are usually purely for flavor. Whether or not you wear one makes no difference to Armor Class, barring enchantments. One exception exists in the <em>Complete Fighter's Handbook</em> for AD&amp;D's 2nd edition, which discusses a more detailed treatment of helmets as an optional rule...by which they mostly provide penalties to sight and hearing in exchange for some minor side benefits and <em>still</em> don't affect overall armor class. An attacker could in theory, using another optional rule, make an attack specifically against an unarmored head's "natural" armor class rather than that of the actual body armor they're wearing, but said rule then itself penalizes head shots sufficiently that it'd take a pretty extreme contrast to actually make that worthwhile.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, a helmet is an integral and necessary part of any player's kit. Nonetheless, it's completely optional whether or not your helmet is visible on your character. However, it remains equipped either way. Of course, most of the important NPCs aren't wearing helmets either, although there are still some notable NPCs who always wear them (Maiev and Darion Mograine) or for an important battle (Tirion Fordring, Varok Saurfang and Muradin Bronzebeard in Icecrown Citadel).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, helmet visibility is optional. Likewise, one of the starting options for warriors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> is "no helmet at all." A symbol of the warrior's lack of fear of death.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline">Warhammer Online</a></em>, helmet visibility is optional.
</li><li> Generally, a lot of MMORPGs have helmet visibility options, partially due to this trope and partially to make the choice of the avatar's hair matter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>: Gordon Freeman is never depicted with his helmet on in official art, despite his HEV suit coming with one and every other HEV wearer wearing one. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Arguments have been made</a> over why nobody shoots him in the head and why he can breathe on Xen, the consensus being that he does have a helmet. He just doesn't wear it all the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar1">Gears of War</a></em>, the protagonists don't wear helmets, and doing so seems to doom you to an untimely death. The helmet design makes it difficult to spot snipers with only two small spots for your eyes to look out of.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar2">Gears of War 2</a></em> has a couple instances where the protagonists and Ben Carmine (who wears a helmet at all times) point out situations where wearing the helmet would have been incredibly useful.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> and ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar3">Gears of War 3</a></em> with Clayton Carmine, who is shot in the head by a friendly sniper mistaking him for a hostile... but the poor angle of the impact causes the round to glance off his helmet, leaving him stunned but unhurt. If he had not been wearing the helmet, it would have killed him. Clayton's tattoo he got in memorial of his fallen brothers shows their helmets. For the Carmine family, their helmets <em>are</em> their real faces. Each of them even wears a unique helmet design.
</li><li> Referenced in the first panel of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=218">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VGCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VGCats">VG Cats</a></em> comic.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, all characters except Tali have a helmet on/off option with no disadvantage for not wearing a helmet. Only when the atmosphere isn't breathable do all characters wear their helmets. This might be justified by the fact that the character rely more on shields than physical armor to protect them from high-tech weaponry. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, however, wearing a helmet does give you stat advantages... you alone, and the bonus for wearing most helmets isn't really all that impressive, with both of your starting helmets providing a whopping 5% more health. Your allies don't even get the <em>option</em> anymore. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">third installment</a>, you have the option of helmet visibility for cutcenes for Shepard and squadmates separately. The Mars level is still kind of weird, as we <em>see</em> Shepard's team taking their helmets on and off whenever is convenient. It's unclear where exactly they go, or why - when set to "off in conversations" - everyone's helmets will disintegrate the moment you stop to chat, then rematerialise as soon as the conversation ends.
<ul><li> It's also zigzagged throughout <em>Mass Effect 3</em>'s Multiplayer. All human characters wear helmets, some turians and krogans do and some don't, <em>none</em> of the asari or drell wear helmets, all quarians wear helmets and the geth are completely helmetless. Because they're robots.
</li><li> Many players deliberately invoke this trope, as wearing the helmet obscures the character's face during the cutscenes when they wear them (hence the option to remove them in ME3 in case the player wants the stat boosts a helmet provides). Conversely, some helmets in the second and third games make the character look disturbing, as they cover up the upper part of the face and have no eye pieces (there are displays on the inside of the helmet so Shepard can see).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> if you equip a helmet on any character, it shows whether you like it or not, but is magically removed during all dialogue scenes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">The sequel</a> goes further and restricts your party members to their unique ungradable armor sets (<em>ME2</em>-style), none of which features anything remotely face-concealing. Hawke may still wear a helmet but it is magically removed during dialogue, like in the first game. In <em>Dragon Age II</em> you can check the "Hide Helmet" box in the interface settings, found in the options. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Why, of course they would be removed during dialogs</a>! It's rude to talk to somebody with your helmet on.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc">Luminous Arc</a></em> games, as with a lot of SRPGs, the player spends a considerable amount of money on helmets, hoods, hats and other headgear which NEVER makes a difference to the character designs in-game.
</li><li> Armored knights/generals in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games generally wear helmets that obscure their faces while in combat, especially in the GBA games, where characters of a class shared the same battle sprites — but will be helmetless in dialogue. In, say, <em>Path of Radiance</em> and <em>Radiant Dawn</em>, your generals won't bother. Admittedly, in Gatrie's case, his armor hides the lower half of his face anyway.
<ul><li> None of <em>Radiant Dawn's</em> Marshalls (third-tier armored knights) wear helmets. While Gatrie and Brom never use headgear in RD, Tauroneo and new addition Meg do start out helmeted. That's right — they promote <em>out</em> of helmets.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone2">Killzone 2</a></em>. While the main cast of heroes never wear combat helmets, virtually everybody else does. In fact, combat helmets act as an actual gameplay mechanic, with few weapons being capable of penetrating an enemys helmet on impact. The helmet is however knocked off the enemy mook, ensuring the next headshot to be fatal. Finally, the trope itself is lampshaded in the games cinematic intro, with a news topic briefly scrolling during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">big bads</a> speech. The topic reads: "Combat helmets, are they really necessary?"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourArmor">Inverted</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> series. The helmet of the Master Chief is one of the iconic images of the series and looks pretty awesome; no wonder we never see his head without it!
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></em> the faceless Rookie always wears his helmet, but the rest of his unit will take theirs off or de-tint the visors whenever they're not in combat. You also have an option to play as one of the other squad members in Firefight without a helmet, and you'll take the same amount of headshot damage either way.
</li><li> A similar situation happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em>; the members of NOBLE Team always wear their helmets during combat situations, but only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Noble Six</a> and Emile will keep them on when the shooting stops.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloWars">Halo Wars</a></em> with Sergeant Forge, who is the only UNSC ground pounder in the game to never wear a helmet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>, this is played almost completely straight by Sarah Palmer.
</li><li> The various UNSC Army and Marine sergeants all seem to prefer wearing caps as opposed to the helmets worn by their subordinates.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloWars2">Halo Wars 2</a></em> multiplayer; the given reason for Sergeant Johnson's super-advanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> not having a helmet is "Well, would YOU hide behind an armored faceplate if you had Sergeant Johnson's rugged good looks?"
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII">Ultima VIII</a>: Pagan</em>, where the Avatar's in-game appearance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedEquipment">even when he is not wearing any armour at all</a>, features a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_helm">Great Helm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that <a class="urllink" href="http://raoow.blogspot.ch/2010_06_01_archive.html">completely obscures his features<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This led to some fans giving him the nickname <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Ol' Bucket-Head</a>. The Avatar's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver">Crossover</a> appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper">Dungeon Keeper</a></em> is modelled after the sprite from Pagan.
<ul><li> The Knights in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonKeeper">Dungeon Keeper</a></em> games also wear helmets, be they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmour">good</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight">evil</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII">Starcraft II</a></em> makes a point of giving all the power-armored characters helmets with reflective (and presumably armored) visors. They tend to raise them fairly often in cutscenes, even when sometimes a little extra protection seems like it would be quite worthwhile. At least there's a second, transparent visor behind the outer one that keeps the suit sealed.
<ul><li> The marine helmets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">don't tend to protect them</a> against enemy attack though. The one time a visor is shown lowered in battle, that marine almost immediately gets impaled through the visor.
</li><li> Ground vehicle pilots tend to not have any sort of helmets at all, odd when compared to their original Starcraft equivalents sometimes epic headgear. The new siege tank driver looks like he's driving a tank in an officer's dress uniform, sans topper. Special mention must go to the Viking pilot, who opens and closes his faceplate when the unit changes form, and the Banshee pilot, who lowers a display eyeshield and blacks out the cockpit glass when she cloaks.
</li><li> The Protoss also invert this trope pretty hard. The base infantry Zealot goes bareheaded, but the unit portraits for some of the heroic and pilot characters feature some really epic headgear. Of course, protoss don't have much in the way of a face, so concealing it isn't that big an issue.

</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, at least for the player character, where actually equipping helmets and other headgear is a necessity to make the most out of your gear, but actually having them be enclosed or even visible on your head is strictly optional; there are commands both for making your headgear invisible and for moving its face-concealing parts out of the way, on top of a system to use a glamour prism to make it look like something else entirely, like a simple beret, bandanna, or a feather in your hair. Cutscenes beginning from <em>Heavensward</em> start to enforce this, as even if you have your helmet visible, it will be toggled off for certain cutscenes. A particular standout is in the Grand Melee about halfway through <em>Heavensward</em>'s post-release story, where your current outfit is temporarily glamoured into a set of Ishgardian armor - minus any sort of helmet, even if you toggle it visible - while, in an inversion, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raubahn</span> wears a helmet with a face-concealing visor for the first time in his fight against you.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>, in which party member Zoah wears a helmet... And pretty much nothing else.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em> games none of your soldiers wear helmets even while fighting in a civil war or against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">a whole empire</a>, since they've got to show off their unique appearances and personalities. In contrast the villainous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> and morally ambiguous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirts">red shirts</a> wear helmets that either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">cover their faces</a> or hide their eyes.
</li><li> Played with occasionally in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series. Usually Samus subverts this trope by wearing a helmet that fully conceals her face, but in some games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpaceEveryoneCanSeeYourFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpaceEveryoneCanSeeYourFace">her visor is fully transparent</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Other M</a></em> she can polarize and depolarize the opacity of her visor at will (she depolarizes the visor when speaking to people to appear less intimidating, but otherwise has it opaque during combat). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Federation Marines</a> in <em>Other M</em> try to find a medium by having helmets that mechanically open to completely reveal their faces (unfortunately the opened helmets look a bit top-heavy, giving them a tendency towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">Dark Helmet Syndrome</a>).
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em>, the helmet can apparently be teleported on and off at Samus's whim, but the only times she does it is when an overdose of Phazon causes her to vomit, and parts of the ending. Otherwise she never takes off the helmet during a mission, even on planets with earthlike atmosphere. Nor does anyone else, except for Admiral Dane.

The only exceptions are Ogryn BONEheads who wear a horned helmet and some Battle Sister squad leaders. Squad leaders and heroes of other factions vary a good deal: The Chaos Lord is bareheaded (though Eliphas gets a helmet), the Eldar Farseer, Tau commander and Shas'ui (unlike the tabletop) have helmets. A line from the helmetless Force Commander of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> 2</em> "My faith is my shield!...", combined with his somewhat-unlikely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">chiseled and handsome visage</a> has led to the popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">Mondegreen</a> of "My face is my shield!"
</li><li> Played absolutely straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warhammer40000SpaceMarine">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a></em>, as with all other 40K examples. Titus, Sidonus, Inquisitor Drogan, Lt. Mira, and Inquisitor Thrax <em>all</em> go without helmets. Leandros has one to start with, but it is damaged and promptly discarded during the scene in which you meet up with him. The Orks of course don't wear helmets, though almost all of the other various mook-of-the-minute types (the Imperial guardsmen, Chaos militia, etc.) all wear helmets.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Zack</a> wears a helmet meant to resemble a Greek helmet and the SOLDIER helmet for all of 10 seconds, plus however long it takes you to beat the first battle with him. Once it's knocked off, he never wears it again.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, the main characters in <em>Birth By Sleep</em> all wear armor into combat, only for them to lose the helmets for one reason or another (Terra remove his, Aqua's is knocked off by an attack, and Ventus' is smashed against a cliff).
</li></ul></li><li> Most units in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> series wear full armor with helmets, but Commando units usually don't. In Tanya's case, she barely wears anything protective at all.
</li><li> This trope is common throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> series, as its main characters rarely wear helmets, even when riding at the head of helmet-clad troops.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">Uncharted</a></em>'s multiplayer, only villains wore helmets. Taken to eleven in Uncharted 3's multiplayer, where you can buy ten different helmets for your custom villain — and the only one a hero can get is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone">ISA helmet</a>, which you need real money to buy.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Section8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Section8">Section 8</a></em>. Your character is almost never seen without his helmet, which also applies to some allies, while villains are usually seen helmetless.
<ul><li> Dropping in from orbit without a helmet may be hazardous to your health.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> series. Being based on 3rd Edition <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, helmets <em>usually</em> don't add anything to Armor Class, but to an extent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a> at higher levels anyway. The real reason to wear a helmet is for its enchantments: most basic helmets (particularly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">the sequel</a>) will add +1 to Concentration, which is useful to spellcasters.
</li><li> One of the gameplay options in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a></em> lets players hide helmets on their character.
</li><li> A weird, villainous version in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em>. In <em>Champions</em>, your equipment <em>never</em> affects your appearance, so you can go naked if you want. However, bad guy organization VIPER have units called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jetpack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jetpack">Air Cavalry</a>... and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Air Cavalry Ace</a>. The Air Cavs have the standard VIPER full-concealment helmet, but the Aces only wear goggles. Then, eventually, VIPER subverts it with Viper-X, apparently the leader of the Air Cavalry, who does not appear to wear a helmet (and then it slides into place when he enters combat).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade">Infinity Blade</a></em> completely inverts this trope: every character is never seen without their helmet, even the enemies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">wear no armor at all</a>. The later games show the main characters without helmets here and there, but this is only for a short while before they re-equip their armor around the clock.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI">God of War</a></em> as Kratos is badass enough that he barely wears any armor at all let alone a helmet, however early concept art from the game had him dressed in full Hoplite suits. The developers actually started removing the armor, helmet included, because he looked <em>too</em> heroic.
</li><li> Not a single major character in David Mason's squad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII">Call of Duty: Black Ops II</a></em> wears a helmet, including David himself - the only member of the squad who does, Crosby, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">completely disappears from the plot</a> after his first mission and only reappears much later in the story to get non-fatally shot. The only time Harper is ever seen wearing one is during the wingsuit sequence in "Celerium" and the jetpack one in "Judgment Day", and even then, he actually <em>takes it off</em> after landing.
</li><li> Played with in<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>:</em> The character usually keeps their helmet on at all times, but the player can set helmets to invisible and invoke this trope. The only time the game forces you to go helmetless is when a crafting station is used. Which makes perfect sense, as delicate craftsmanship would be a lot harder with a face covering helmet on.
</li><li> Done oddly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimsMedieval">The Sims Medieval</a></em>: men wear helmets, women don't. The default armor for women is otherwise sensible (it's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainmailBikini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainmailBikini">Chainmail Bikini</a> and may even cover her more than her regular outfit) but there is no helmet, unlike the default men's armor. However, some other armors include helmets whether they're worn by men or women.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:

And because it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>, many players leave the headgear on—especially Troopers, Bounty Hunters, and Sith—as they are quite proud of the masks and helmets they bought, hunted down, or fought for completing the character's look.

The game really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">goes the extra mile in regards to this trope</a>, however, in that it was only in the DLC that helmets were added.

Raiden and the Winds of Destruction <em>do</em> engage their helmets/visors whenever they fight each other, but only right at the end of the cutscene just before they fight. Raiden does consistently wear his visor when he fights the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, but only so that said boss can shatter the visor early on and expose Raiden's face for the rest of the game.

Some champions have an excuse in that they can protect themselves with magic (like Lux's shield ability) or have personal reasons for going armorless (Draven, who's a gladiator). Of course, there are also plenty of characters who <em>do</em> wear helmets, like Jarvan IV, Kayle, Master Yi, Pantheon, and Quinn. Nautilus is a special case in that he's fused to his armor, and Kai'sa does have a helmet- but it's off by default and is only toggled on during her dash or if the player wants it on.

<ul><li> Some Celtic and Germanic tribes disliked using helmets, or only chiefs wealthy enough to afford them did.
</li><li> In one (sort of) example, after being unhorsed at the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror removed his helmet so his allies could see that he was still alive.
</li><li> The full helmets of the high mediaeval period seriously restricted the wearer's vision. As such, a lot of knights chose to raise or remove their visors for hand-to-hand combat, accepting the increased risk as a necessary sacrifice in order to remain aware of what was going on around them. Of course, they were very seldom dumb enough to go <em>bareheaded</em>.
</li><li> Historically, captured knights (and other armoured opponents) relinquished their weapons, helmets, and a gauntlet. The gauntlet was for later identification of their captor so he could claim the ransom. The reason for surrender of the weapons should be obvious, but the helmet was removed so that even if the captive could find weapons he would be unable to effectively fight, given that a conflict with a bare-headed opponent ends very, very quickly. Removal of helmet = death in combat. Good examples of this come from records of the French-English battle at Agincourt.
</li><li> For similar reasons, in American football a player's helmet is taken immediately when they suspect he has a concussion specifically to prevent him going back out onto the field, since even a concussed player realizes that without a helmet he can't play (both for practical reasons and because it's against the rules).
<ul><li> Before the NFL mandated wearing a helmet in 1939, some players- most famously Philadelphia Eagles end Bill Hewitt- refused to wear one, believing it would impede their senses and reaction time.
</li></ul></li><li> The whole of heraldry derives from the medieval practice of a knight actually wearing a coat of arms — i.e., a coat over his armor — with a distinctive pattern, so that he could be recognized even while wearing a face-concealing helmet. Eventually knights started duplicating the pattern on their shields, and then the pattern evolved into a personal/family emblem represented on a stylized shield.
</li><li> The trope was practically enforced in private duels and in fencing practice with foiled rapiers or smallswords from roughly the 16th-18th centuries. Foiled swords had blunted tips covered with tennis-ball-sized pads in order to reduce the chances of poking someone's eye out (it still happened), but wearing any kind of fencing mask was considered unmanly and they really didn't catch on until the 19th century.
</li><li> Police forces in many countries such as the U.S. tend not to wear helmets, either wearing distinctive hats or going bareheaded. They spend the vast majority of their time patroling or dealing with minor offenses, and military-style helmets look too threatening while also being too cumbersome and uncomfortable to wear all day.
</li><li> Inverted for SWAT teams and the like, who wear helmets for protection because they are dispatched specifically to respond to violent emergencies. Helmets and masks serve to hide their identities in case of reprisals, and by making them look scarier also increase the likelihood of the perp(s) hopefully surrendering upon seeing them without firing a shot. On the other hand, the increasing use of such gear by non-SWAT units and the dispatching of SWAT teams to deal with more routine situations have been criticized as part of the excessive militarization of law enforcement, since military-style gear can encourage officers to have an inappropriately aggressive mindset and the public tends to mistrust police forces that look like an occupying army.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">Cricketers</a> first started wearing helmets in the 1970s, some commentators didn't like it. One asked the great Don Bradman about the trend. Bradman replied that if he had been offered a helmet during the infamous bodyline series (where the English constantly bowled short-pitched deliveries that bounced up to around the Australian batsmen's head area), <em>he</em> would have worn one.

During the battle, he was knocked off his horse and badly shaken, so he had his armor and helmet taken up by Megacles, who was of similar build to him. A Roman horseman manages to kill Megacles and sever his head, holding it up and riding down the lines to show that he had killed the Epirote king. The Epirote army began to falter, until Pyrrhus took up a horse and started riding along the lines without a helmet, showing his men he was alive.
</li><li> British troops based in southern Iraq wore berets instead of helmets on patrol in an effort to win over the local population. This is SOP for peacekeeping operations; it makes the soldiers appear less threatening... unless the soldiers in question are from the Parachute Regiment or the Royal Marines (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Names to Run Away from Really Fast</a> if you're an enemy combatant), whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">distinctively-coloured berets</a> serve as a remarkably effective deterrent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for some special operations forces, who may forgo helmets and body armor depending upon the mission profile. This is not to say it doesn't compromise their combat effectiveness, it's just that in some missions, blending in is deemed more important. For example, scouts and recon often forgo wearing a helmet as it can limit vision and hearing. Snipers will typically not wear helmets while they are stalking to get into position and taking their shot.
</li><li> During the evolution of the NHL during the seventies, Canadian players protested the new rules regarding helmet use. According to the Canadian players, a mask for the goalie was enough. Bizarrely, players from the States and Europe didn't tend to agree. This is especially visible during the 1972 Summit Series. The Canadian National team were bareheaded throughout (except for, oddly enough, eventual series hero Paul Henderson), while the Red Army team wore helmets.
</li><li> The Chinese People's Liberation Army Marine Corps. While half of them wear the standard black helmet with goggles on the helmet, the other half <a class="urllink" href="http://i1125.photobucket.com/albums/l597/Cifyra/PLA/PLAN/U135P200T1D207292F16DT20081225172132.jpg">wear wool/fleece tuques with goggles on their tuque caps<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. Justified for the tuques keep their head warm at sea and the fact that they are mainly a peace keeping force escorting vessels near the Gulf of Aden.
</li><li> Many tank commanders also preferred not to wear helmets as they thought they were too restrictive when they did get inside the turret. Not surprisingly, wounds to tank commanders were usually to the head and often fatal. In WW2, American tank crews took fewer casualties than their British counterparts despite usually riding around in the same tanks because the Americans wore helmets and the British merely wore berets.
</li><li> A common reason for bikers and bicyclists not wearing helmets is because the rider thinks they're uncool.
</li><li> Pyotr Grigorenko in his <em> In the underground you can meet only rats</em> memoirs wrote about such a trend among some early Soviet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalOfficer">Political Officers</a> (the sort of guys who had some rank, but no one dared to give them any actual command positions even during the total mobilization), which he had to counteract and urge his men to wear helmets. In the end, the best argument was visual one — his own helmet discarded due to a big, sharp, gnarled-looking shrapnel stuck in it (he got away with a scratch and light knockdown that time).
</li><li> U.S. soldiers deployed onto the Normandy beaches for the D-Day invasion were <em>instructed</em> to remove their helmets first if they had to jump overboard in a pinch. This is because they were trained to jump in feet first, and if they left their helmets in place with the chin-strap still fastened, the sudden rush of water into the helmet during submergence could snap the wearer's neck.
</li><li> Inverted in the video <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9yL5usLFgY">I Love Helmets<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which a helmet-wearing skateboarder gets up totally unhurt despite wiping out and hitting his head on the pavement. He gleefully declares, "I love helmets!"
</li><li> In Xenophon's Anabasis, an account of the expedition of several companies of Greeks into the Persian Empire under the leadership of Cyrus the Younger, Cyrus is said to have entered his battle with king Artaxerxes II (his brother) bare-headed. Just as the battle was about to be turned in his favor, he was struck a fatal blow under the eye with a javelin. Wear your helmets, kids.
</li><li> On Trajan's Column in Rome, Italy (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentOfHumiliationAndDefeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentOfHumiliationAndDefeat">triumphal column</a> commemorating Emperor Trajan's victory in the Dracian Wars) the Roman soldiers have their helmets cut away and shield size cut down to reveal more of their faces. Their Dacian opponents aren't shown with helmets at all, except as battle trophies, perhaps to make them appear less martial and heroic.
</li><li> When the Brody helmet (the British "tin hat" helmet) was introduced in 1915 (as protection from shrapnel shells detonating over the trenches), there was a lot of skepticism and dismissal of the idea, in part because it was seen as an archaism that was pointless on the modern battlefield (because it couldn't deflect bullets, which were still seen as the more significant threat). This conclusion seemed at first to be confirmed when there was an increased rate of reported head injuries, until it was noticed that it corresponded with a reduction in overall fatalities. In other words, Tommies were now <em>surviving</em> head wounds that used to simply kill them without the helmets. After that, the objections generally vanished. Similar disputes, and results, were seen with the French Adrian helmet (which became the common helmet design across most of Europe in various forms, with even one of the Central Powers, Austria-Hungary, adopting a design based on it) and the German stahlhelm (the famous "coal scuttle" helmet) when they were introduced.
</li><li> Horse-riders are notorious for not liking to wear helmets, at least for older teens and adults. May stem from the association of horses with nobility/wealthy, since they were usually the only people who could AFFORD a proper riding horse in the first place.
