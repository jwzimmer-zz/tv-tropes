The character will, through fate or choice, be presented as not having any friends, or at least not within easy visiting or communication range. They will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingLunchAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingLunchAlone">eating lunch alone</a>, or looking forlornly/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">enviously</a> at others with friends and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interests</a>, and usually be found immersed in reading, video games, or some other highly solitary activity.
</p><p>These are the most common causes:
</p><ul><li> <strong>Newcomer</strong>: Be they a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent">New Transfer Student</a> in a new school, an employee at a new work place, or having escaped their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Doomed Hometown</a> as a refugee.
</li><li> <strong>The Loner</strong>: Might be because of preference or ostracism. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">Freakishness</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFashionMildMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFashionMildMind">optional.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass-ness</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality">optional.</a>
</li><li> <strong>Homeschooled</strong>: Similar to Newcomer, the character has grown up or lived away from others. May or may not come with interesting psychological quirks.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Trauma</strong>: Some sadness like parental abuse (often seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Dark Magical Girls</a>) or other kind of angst may keep the character from letting anyone close to them, can result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shyness</a></strong>: Some characters (like in real life) are insecure of themselves for whatever reason and are not even able to talk to other people (sometimes temporary).
</li><li> <strong>Lack of self-confidence</strong>: Similar to the one above, the character may believe they're not worthy of other people's friendship while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">craving acceptance.</a> Or possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial">they want to feel like they're important, but don't</a>. Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> characters are prone to this.
</li><li><strong>Incompetence</strong>: A character may simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">lack the social intuition</a> required to connect with others, regardless of how willing or confident they are.
</li><li> <strong>Unattractiveness</strong>: The character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrotesque">physically repulsive</a> and avoided or mistreated because of that.
</li></ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The last five types can result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">envy</a> for more extroverted characters (like Misao from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy">Magical Project S</a></em>).
</p><p>What's curious about this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> (or present) is that it's incredibly easy to fix. "When you have nothing to lose, you stand to gain everything", so to speak. In short order the character will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrashIntoHello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrashIntoHello">Crash-Into Hello</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">get in a fight</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetCute">drop their groceries</a> or make a new friend through less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">quirky</a> means. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">Before long they'll make loads more friends</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0o9au');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0o9au" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0o9au');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Which for some reason usually become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSocialCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSocialCircle">Limited Social Circle</a>, but hey, it's easier to keep track of than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">Cast of Snowflakes</a>!)</span> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">join a group of them</a>. Despite their lack of social skills or experience they'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">magnetically gather</a> new friends thanks to their at times strange but honest charm and learn to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> to its fullest.
</p><p>Of course you can expect the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedLoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedLoner">"genuine" loners</a> who become one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">moan</a> about being stuck <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">With Friends Like These...</a> — all while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold">secretly thanking</a> them all.
</p><p>In more tragic cases, a friendless character whose new friends turn out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend">False Friends</a> is very vulnerable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">falling to despair</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">even</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">worse things</a>.
</p><p>It should be mentioned that this can become implied against the author's wishes if the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfDetail">never mentions</a> or demonstrates having had friends before meeting their new ones, and/or never hangs out with anyone outside their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSocialCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSocialCircle">Limited Social Circle</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge</a> Loners, so to speak. If they had any friends, they're kind of like a set of living <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFallenFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenFallenFriend">Forgotten Fallen Friends</a>. Of course, this can be fixed by introducing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredChildhoodFriend">Beleaguered Childhood Friend</a>, showing a photo album, or introducing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Those Two Guys</a> as friends.

Unlike Natsu, though, she doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">appear</a> to be too traumatized by it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice">A Silent Voice</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ishida Shouya and his entire class in bullied a young deaf girl who transferred into their school badly, ostracizing and tormenting her as often as they could, with the teacher allowing and encouraging it from the background. When confronted by the principal on this, his entire class used him as a scapegoat, feigning innocence and causing him to take the blame for everything. Ishida spent the next <em>five years</em> being ostracized by his entire school, constantly mocked, beaten and bullied, well also believing he deserved it completely for what he did to the deaf girl years before. He eventually decides his whole life is basically meaningless because of these factors and decides it would be easier and <em>better</em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">just kill himself.</a> Thankfully he decides against it and slowly begins developing friends later. Shouya insists he had no friends in prior to the ostracization however elementary portions clearly shows him frequently hanging out with two boys. It's possible he did not consider them "real friends" as they abandoned him when he began being bullied.
</li><li> Shouko herself didn't have any friends growing up due to being ostracized because of her deafness. After she met Shouya she began making friends alongside him.

<ul><li> Gaara never had a single person in his village who loved him - not even his own parents - because everyone (including his own siblings) was afraid of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">the tailed beast sealed inside him</a>.

However, flashbacks from his, Choji's and Shikamaru's point of view showed that they hung out together at times with Kiba as the "Dead Lasts". Shikamaru was Choji's first and only friend before that point, and his parentage didn't enforce Naruto's ostracism like other families did. So, how friendless Naruto (or Choji) was depends on who's telling the story, how close their association can be considered to friendship, and how much the author wants you to think their life sucked compared to who they're fighting. And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie">The Last: Naruto the Movie</a></em> tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> this by making Hinata each other's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friend</a> in childhood.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto1997">prototype pilot</a>, Naruto is undeniably in this trope. The only person who even professes to be his friend in his village of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">Youkai</a> (Naruto <strong>is</strong> a Nine-tailed fox in the pilot, rather than host to one) does so in an attempt to get out of Naruto's pit trap, before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail">threatening to tell on Naruto if he doesn't let him out</a>. As a result of this, the chief (who lost all eight of his friends while fighting Naruto's father) tells Naruto not to return to the village until he brings back a human friend.
</li><li> Despite being popular with girls and held in respect for his skills. Sasuke is not close to anyone, even before his family's massacre as the flashbacks to it show. Sasuke didn't hang out or was close to anyone outside of his family.

Nobody before his master, and later Tanjiro, bothered to notice Zenitsus good qualities beyond his apparent faults.

Sailor Jupiter tearfully asks if she has anyone like Usagi to be there for her, and the queen gets angry and blasts her.
</li><li> On another note, at least in the movies, it's shown at least twice that all of the Inner Senshi had little to no friends before Usagi befriended them. However, the movies may be separate from the anime continuity. Anime episode 54 suggests that Rei is pretty popular at her school (she attends a different school from the others).

For a long time Zenkichi was her only real friend. Which is why she drags him along with her, she is desperate not to be alone again. Abnormals in general seem to have this sort of background; their Abnormalities make it nearly impossible for them to form connections with other people. "Minuses" also have these backgrounds, except they don't want friends either. The Abnormal Hinokage has it the worst though: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> people can't even remember him...<em>because he is so awesome they forget him out of sheer fear</em>.</span>

<ul><li> Shinra and Izaya are in a similar situation. The only person Izaya was ever close to in his life was Shinra.

<ul><li> Harry himself. Prior to going to Hogwarts, he's an outcast at his Muggle school, partly because of the tatty hand-me-downs and broken glasses he wears, but mostly because his cousin Dudley is the school bully and no-one wanted to befriend Harry (his primary target) and become targets of his bullying too. Dudley's gang frequently beats him up, referred to as "Harry Hunting." He is absolutely friendless until Hagrid shows up in his life.
</li><li> Ron is mocked for being poor by the Slytherins, and of course is perpetually in Harry's shadow, so he's an outcast to an extent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> indicates many wizarding children, including the Weasleys, are homeschooled before starting Hogwarts, so it seems they conveniently don't have much chance to make friends before they're eleven. You'd think the Weasley kids would have made friends with Luna considering how close she lives to them, but book 5 seems to be the first time she and Ron meet. No wonder Ginny got so entranced in that diary — she literally had no one to talk to other than her older brothers and parents.
</li><li> And Hermione... well, she was a stuck-up prissy know-it-all in the first book. To misquote Ron, "No wonder she hasn't got any friends!" But probably Neville has it worst in their year, until book 4 or 5.
</li><li> Luna also seems to suffer heavily from this trope. Being somewhat strange, she is heavily teased or just ignored. She loved being part of the DA because "it was just like having friends". When the trio happens upon her room they see that she hand-painted a magical mural of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville, all interlocked by a moving golden chain of "friends" repeated over and over</a>.

<ul><li> Brienne of Tarth is treated pretty poorly by the men she meets, as they scoff at her for acting manly, but laugh on the rare occasions she's forced to act feminine. Brienne says that the women are worse. One of the reasons she falls so hard for Renly is because he was nice to her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">and this goes double for Jaime</a>.
</li><li> Sam has it even worse. Oh sure, he got along with his mother and sisters, but his soft, gentle demeanor was not only mocked by essentially everyone but was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyCouldntYouBeDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyCouldntYouBeDifferent">a source of serious abuse</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">his father</a>. Then he goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">the Wall</a> where he becomes fast friends with Jon Snow and all of Jon's friends.
</li></ul></li><li> Various characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series fit the trope in various ways.
<ul><li> Rincewind seems to have made very few friends, except perhaps the exasperating Twoflower, if only because he's usually running too fast to get away from some kind of danger. (He says that his parents ran away from home before he was born.) Even once he settles down, he's something of a loner, if only because his new colleagues regard him with amiable contempt and <em>use</em> him for various purposes.
</li><li> Susan makes a couple of friends at school, but they're fellow loner/outsider types. Even at that stage, it's clear that she's a bit too weird and a bit too intelligent to get close to normal human beings. Once she learns that she's the granddaughter of Death, with all that implies, fighting the dangers of isolation becomes a full-time issue for her — though she manages.
</li><li> The trope is <em>really</em> central to the whole species of noble dragons, however. "Noble dragons don't have friends. The nearest they can get to the idea is an enemy who is still alive." Of course, they don't care.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud">Thud!</a></em> when Vimes learns Mr A.E. Pessimal's initials don't actually stand for anything, he asks the government inspector what his friends call him. Mr Pessimal looks like this question involves a pretty huge assumption, so Vimes decides to back down on the confrontation a bit.
</li></ul></li><li> The background of quite a few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a></em> characters. Briar was part of a gang as a kid, but they seemed more like 'allies' then friends with any really degree of concern for one another. Sandry also had a lot of trouble making friends; her parents moved continiously, other noble parents didn't want their children associating with such a strange family, while commoner kids regarded her with great suspicion. This made her just very, <em>very</em> determined to make friends. Tris, however, was by far the worst off, being neglected by her relatives and bullied by almost all her peers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhyWeTookTheCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhyWeTookTheCar">Why We Took the Car</a></em>, Maik is stated to have no friends at all. Tschick appears to have no friends either when he enters Maik's school, and never makes any there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rolitania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rolitania">Rolitania</a></em>, Samuel is friendless in either timeline. In the first timeline, the equally lonely Kuro befriends him.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SchooledInMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SchooledInMagic">Schooled in Magic</a></em> series, Emily left nothing she valued or missed behind on Earth (relationship wise), such as a loving family or friends. In fact, she feels like her life only just got started now that she's left Earth behind.
</li><li> Christian Ozera from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy">Vampire Academy</a></em> had no friends until warming up to Lissa and Rose. Went with his status as a social outcast.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em> and its sequels, a friendless background is par for the course for the Salmissras - it's very hard to make friends in a court where everyone is trying to poison everyone else in order to increase their own power and influence, and the royal pharmacologists (who are the real power behind the throne) prefer to keep their queens lonely and codependent so that they'll constantly seek to get drugged out of their gourds.
</li><li> Ishmael from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DontCallMeIshmael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DontCallMeIshmael">Don't Call Me Ishmael!</a></em> is bullied and doesn't have any friends at school until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent">New Transfer Student</a> Scobie makes him join the debate team.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProjectTau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProjectTau">Project Tau</a></em>: Kalin falls squarely into this trope, possibly due to his high intelligence.

<ul><li> Amy Farrah Fowler of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> is this trope personified. She has a preoccupation with friendship activities, especially with Penny, because this is the first time in her life she's been able to experience anything of the sort. Sheldon didn't have any friends back home either, but he's less concerned about it. (Perhaps because his family, even though they didn't understand him, loved him.

</li></ul></li><li> Most of the main characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>, for various reasons: Britta is a hypocritical buzzkill, Abed is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">weird</a>, Annie was an awkward nerd in high school, Pierce is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> and Chang is certifiably insane.

She's been kicked off multiple anti-terrorism taskforces in the past for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">being too blunt</a>, and when she joins the team, she has nobody to put down as an emergency contact until Cooper volunteers himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>: While it isn't mentioned too often, the Doctor himself apparently had a very lonely and miserable childhood. He once remarks on the unpleasantness of being "the only kid left outside", and when asked if he knows what that's like emphatically replies that he does. In fact, all indications suggest that he had a grand total of one friend his own age growing up, and that was the Master.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>, ironically. Although by the time the series starts the gang - in their early twenties - have formed their tight-knit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>, several of them are hinted to have been this growing up. In particular Chandler never mentions any friends from when he was younger and is upset he has hardly anyone to invite to his wedding.
<ul><li> Subverted concerning Rachel and Monica. In high school Rachel was the popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch">Lovable Alpha Bitch</a> and Monica, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBestFriend">Fat Best Friend</a>, was implied to be this trope. However, during the series Monica mentions or even dates several friends, including her fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat">Formerly Fat</a> friend Will (played by <em>Brad Pitt</em>), her childhood friend who helps Chandler enter advertising, Lewis Posin her "fifth grade best friend", an exchange student whose mom gave her food, and two cousins she was close to growing up. By comparison, all of Rachel's wealthy "friends" ditch her early on and everyone from their old school seems to hate her. It's also worth mentioning that Monica is the rock of the gang who brought them all together, and it was only because of her they accepted Rachel initially. Ultimately it's the awkward Monica rather than the outgoing Rachel who made real friends, despite her apparent unpopularity.

<ul><li> During the flashback that showed how Carly came to know Sam, Carly was eating alone. Probably justifiable since Carly had moved to Seattle from her existing home in California. Not friendless before that though, as she had Missy, her best friend back in California.
</li><li> Freddie apparently came to know Carly and Sam either during the last year of elementary school, or their first year of middle school. Whatever friends Freddie had must have moved to different schools, as it was shown in the earlier episodes his only real friend was Carly. Eventually, he started joining various school clubs and became friends with a handful of other students.
</li><li> Sam was a bully, even in her younger years, and her only 'friend' was likely to be her twin sister Melanie, who left on a boarding school scholarship, as well as being a grade ahead due to Sam falling behind. Carly pushed back when Sam stole her sandwich, and their friendship was born.
</li></ul></li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jessie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jessie">Jessie</a></em> is that Ravi doesn't have any friends besides his pet lizard, Mrs. Kibbling.
</li><li> This seems to initially be the case for Brian Krakow in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MySoCalledLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MySoCalledLife">My So-Called Life</a></em>.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SchittsCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SchittsCreek">Schitt's Creek</a></em> David Rose was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">Lonely Rich Kid</a> who socialized a great deal before moving to the town but only with people interested in what he could obtain for them, not with people who liked him. He tells Stevie that she's the first best friend he's ever had. Stevie admits the same, and little is known about her life before David arrived but it seems like she too had few if any friends.
</li><li> Sherlock Holmes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>. Until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">John</a> comes along, he didn't have any friends at all — Mrs. Hudson being more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> and Lestrade a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce">Friend on the Force</a> of sorts who, while quite a nice man, isn't willing to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder">Cloudcuckoolander's Minder</a> that any friend of Sherlock's inevitably ends up becoming. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation">Intelligence = Isolation</a> combined with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Hero</a> persona are the likely causes, though he makes little effort towards befriending anyone anyway. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother">Mycroft</a> points out in the very first episode:
<div class="indent"><strong>John</strong>: I'm guessing you're not friends. <br/><strong>Mycroft</strong>: You've met him. How many <em>friends</em> do you imagine he has? <em>[...]</em> I am the closest thing to a friend Sherlock Holmes is capable of having: an enemy.
</div><ul><li> Or, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">Sherlock himself</a> puts it:
<div class="indent"><strong>Sherlock</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality">I don't have "friends". I've just got one.</a>

At the beginning of the show he's living alone in a depressing little flat after being invalided home from the Afghan war, he hardly even talks to his sister (from whom he is estranged for reasons that aren't specified, but may be related to the drinking problem that gets literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sherlockscan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sherlockscan">Sherlockscanned</a> in the pilot), and the only friend (or even <em>acquaintance</em>) of his we see is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">Mike Stamford,</a> towards whom he acts rather aloof (though Mike himself is affable enough); and that was merely a chance meeting. Before Sherlock, he also appears to have been entirely alone in the world, as stated by him during his one-sided conversation with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sherlock's headstone</span>:

</li></ul></li><li> Lex Luthor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>. The most poignant scene is actually very short, but drives home the point that Lex has been a loner all his life, probably because he was considered a freak by the other kids (not to mention his twisted upbringing): Adult Lex flashes back to his childhood, to a birthday party where he sits alone at a table surrounded by cakes and paper streamers, crying silently.
</li><li> Spock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>. It's mentioned in the series (and shown in both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">the animated series</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">the 2009 movie</a>) that he was bullied as a child, and it's implied that Kirk is his first real friend. In the episode "The Naked Time" he mentions being ashamed of his friendship with Kirk, so it's possible Vulcans don't generally <em>have</em> friends in the way humans do.
<ul><li> Though they do at least have <em>some</em> variety of friendship; in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E1AmokTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E1AmokTime">Amok Time</a>", Spock formally identifies Kirk and McCoy as his friends to T'Pau, and mentions a legal right to have them present for his wedding in that capacity.

<ul><li> The manga for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> fleshes out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">the protagonist's</a> character quite a bit, and depicts him as friendly and polite, but distant. Because his parent's work causes them to move around a lot, he tries to avoid getting attached to other people, so he won't disappoint them when he leaves, essentially like a perpetual "Newcomer" version of this trope. Naturally, a large part of the game involves him getting over that and forming social links with various people around Inaba.

No one cares beyond that, except Etna who wanted to use him for her own gain, and one of his vassals who expressed disappointment that she didn't get to use the grave she dug for him. Granted, everyone are demons and thus clearly aligned Evil, it's only in their nature to abuse, backstab and use each other. Laharl doesn't even care for his own father aside from disappointment that he found out too late that his father died and thus the competition for his father's Overlord position had been going on for quite some time before he woke up.
