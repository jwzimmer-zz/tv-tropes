After Watanuki manages to help convince a shy girl that her negativity is cursing her to fail and that she should try to be more positive, her more upbeat and outgoing twin suddenly turns into the sister from hell, psyching her out even worse than she ever did to herself until the poor girl is on her knees and paralyzed by the feelings of uselessness her sister is laying on her. Then, after Yuuko intervenes and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> is learned, all is sunshine again.

In episode 32, aptly named "_____", upon meeting a deaf-mute kid, Akko-chan, out of empathy and curiosity, wishes to her magic mirror to be a deaf-mute version of herself. Upon discovering that, being speechless, she can't wish anymore, and she'll be stuck that way forever, Akko-chan breaks apart, feeling scared and useless until the mirror, reasoning that she got her Aesop about hasty wishes and physical ailments, and she understood the true courage of her new friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop">(who will never be seen around for the rest of the series)</a>, lifts the wish on its own accord.

Instances of this include his battles with Prima, Brawley, and Drake of the Elite Four. May also got this in one of her contests when she gained a Coordinator Superiority Complex <em>out of nowhere</em> and was reprimanded for it, and then it never comes up again.
</li><li> The original Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">Hikari</a> a crippling reliance on her brother in the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode">Dark Ocean</a> episode. It may have been an attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue">keep her from looking too perfect</a>, but while she does freak out at the Dark Ocean in a later episode, she doesn't mention Taichi at all.
</li><li> Louise in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em> went through a rapid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGamblingAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGamblingAddict">descent into gambling addiction</a> while trying to go undercover. Despite Saito's best attempts to stop her, she wagered larger and larger amounts until she finally placed all of their remaining funds on one bet, all without winning a single time.

Josuke's tic, biting his bottom lip, appears all of once, where he does it and it gets him captured, despite being nervous several times before and after. This is only the case in the manga, however, as the anime adaptation adds additional moments in previous fights where he can be seen biting his lip.

</li><li> Many authors who worked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> gave Tony Stark's alcoholism a spin of their own, thus making him a borderline example. This trope applies largely because it is always restricted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">specific plotlines</a>. Outside these plots, he may be seen drinking but is never shown having this habit as a problem. Nevertheless, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">is somewhat well known for this aspect of his character</a> and there's no guarantee he won't go on a drinking binge again whenever someone decides they can make an innovative take on it.
</li><li> In the early '90s, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> comics had an infamous period where Mary Jane revealed right out of the blue that she used to be a smoker and a bunch of different stressful events all happening at once (such as Harry Osborn reverting back to his Green Goblin personality and the arrival of Carnage) caused her to have a relapse and take it up again. It lasted for roughly a year and a half or so before Peter was able to get her to drop the habit, and true to this trope, was never brought up again after.

Nothing of the sort was mentioned in the first film. A flashback at the beginning of the second film shows that, even as children, Melman had a crush on Gloria. This is partly due to the fact that a dropped subplot for the first film would've been that Gloria would've been pregnant during the film and Melman, whose crush on her was clear in this version, would've eventually gotten together with Gloria and agree to raise the child with her. Additionally, an inverse case with Melman's hypochondria in the first film, which is completely gone by the sequel. The only hint appears to be his great knowledge of medicine.

</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> had Leonard making up a lie to avoid seeing Penny sing due to her singing being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodToneDeaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodToneDeaf">Hollywood Tone-Deaf</a>. However, other episodes have shown her singing "Soft Kitty" to Sheldon while sounding completely normal.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em> revealed that Rose has been addicted to prescription strength pain-killers for <em>decades</em>. It also strongly implied that her perpetually sweet disposition is at least partially the result of taking these drugs. Despite the coda of the episode having her statement that she'll be fighting this addiction the rest of her life (albeit filled with hope that she can pull it off), it's never truly referred to again. Similar events happened to Dorothy, who had two relapses of former addictions she had beaten (smoking and gambling.) Aside from the episodes in question, they were never mentioned again.
</li><li> Joey from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blossom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blossom">Blossom</a></em> hates a gay guy in one episode, revealing a prejudice that hadn't previously been mentioned in the show. Later in that episode, his black sister-in-law tells him a story about how she faced discrimination as a child, causing him to renounce his prejudice as quickly as he developed it.
</li><li> A particularly offensive episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire">Lizzie McGuire</a></em> featured her pal Miranda becoming anorexic and then getting over it within the course of a week. It also had Gordo becoming addicted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Deeandeeaproximine</a>... and then getting over it within the course of a week.
</li></ul><ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFactsOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFactsOfLife">The Facts of Life</a></em> has Sue Ann getting, and recovering from, anorexia.
</li><li> D.J. became worried about her weight in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em>. She didn't eat for three days straight and was over-exercising. Danny helped her realize that her crash-dieting can eventually lead to developing an eating disorder.
</li></ul><ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpinCity">Spin City</a></em> had Carter trying to quit smoking, despite having never been seen touching tobacco before (or since). This episode also featured Paul getting addicted to nicotine gum.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide">Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide</a></em>, "Guide to School Records"- Ned is a well-intentioned, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">smart but</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">lazy</a>" kid in the rest of the series, but this episode shows him pulling all sorts of deliberately mean pranks on his way to accruing the biggest permanent record in the school. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashbacks</a> are used, which (unusually for the show) were filmed just for this episode, not taken from earlier ones, further playing up the trope.
</li><li> If a young attractive female character is introduced to a series and some fuss is made over the "fact" that she smokes, then it is near certain that that will be the last time that she is seen with tobacco, or that it will even be mentioned. Examples:
<ul><li> Lois Lane in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>.
</li><li> Mimi Clark in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho">Jericho</a></em>.
</li><li> Marissa Taylor in the defunct Australian comedy/drama <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_greener">Always Greener.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> Admittedly this last one could be regarded as just a set-up for a joke about an exploding cow, but credibility was stretched in a later episode where she stood right next to another character who was smoking, without batting an eyelid.

</li></ul></li><li> A particularly extreme example appeared on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome">Rome</a></em>, with the reveal that Octavian was deeply in love with (as in, wanted to have sex with) his own sister. Not only had nothing even hinting about this ever come up before, but the episode itself has zero hints about it until Servilia lets his sister know — which actually justifies it, as he was clearly very good at keeping it secret.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "TOW The Thumb". When the others berate Chandler for his smoking, he rattles off a list of their annoying habits that he puts up with, such as Joey's knuckle-cracking, Phoebe chewing her hair and Monica snorting when she laughs. None of them ever came up before (though this is understandable since it's only the third episode) or after. The one about Ross over-pronouncing every word applies, though.
</li><li> An episode that shows less respect for continuity comes in the Season Five New Year's episode where Rachel suddenly turns into a gossip who can't shut up about her coworkers' dirty laundry. The whole thing turns out to be a plot device to launch us into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdTurkeysAreEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdTurkeysAreEverywhere">Cold Turkeys Are Everywhere</a> plot as Rachel resolves to stop gossiping, and then immediately discovers the unkeepable secret that Chandler and Monica are doin' it.
</li><li> Several episodes made jokes about Chandler being <em>more</em> emotional than the other guys, and "The One With All The Candy" specifically pointed him out as the most likely to cry (and he did). Then, in "The One Where Chandler Can't Cry" it turns out...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesops</a> about snoring tend to suffer from this, as characters spontaneously develop the habit and then no reference is made to this afterwards. Examples include Joey from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> (Chandler can suddenly hear him through the wall after living with him for five years with no problem), Charles Winchester from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> (due to allergies), and Homer Simpson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> (he suddenly starts snoring loudly after years of sleeping with his wife).
<ul><li> The Winchester one is at least understandable if you ignore the show's status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runner</a> and consider it to actually take place within the confines of a stint in a combat zone during the Korean War. Seasonal changes do affect the breathing of some people.
</li></ul></li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> where the crew is forced through the air ducts of Starbug. Lister is revealed to have claustrophobia. Subverted somewhat when Cat lists a number of examples where he's been trapped in a confined space and didn't freak out; naturally, this didn't help Lister.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>: Worf was the victim of this in the episode where a genderless alien species showed up, and he was saying things like it being "unnatural" and the like. This particular prejudice wasn't seen previously in all the cases where he met aliens who didn't have a traditional gender setup and never appeared again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Odo becomes involved with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">Female Changeling</a> in "Behind the Lines" and "Favor the Bold," he becomes utterly obsessed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedSex">linking</a>. Given that their linking scenes have the feel of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">love scenes</a>, and that he neglects other duties to link with her, his actions seem to be a metaphor for sex addiction. This was merely a rare lapse in Odo's normal ability to keep his emotions closely guarded. Several episodes mention or deal with how important Linking is to him and his species, and how much it's the thing he's most forsaking in order to reject The Founder's actions.
</li><li> There was a late episode, where there was a homicidal shapeshifter on the station, and the other main characters responded by revealing their prejudice against shapeshifters, which had never been hinted at before, even after years of fighting a Dominion run by shapeshifters. Might have been partly explained by that particular shapeshifter constantly harping about how everyone else was prejudiced against him for being so superior to them (which inclined them to treat him like a jerk). Odo's friends make an effort to be nice to the stand-offish stranger at first, but he brushes them off and accuses them of trying to make Odo an Uncle Tom.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, in an episode where the Doctor found out that Janeway had tampered with his memories to prevent him going "insane" over an old triage case, and Janeway and the entire crew suddenly seemed to develop an anti-AI prejudice which then immediately vanished again next episode. This is made worse in hindsight because another episode had them arguing the Doctor was a person, not just an AI, when he was denied rights over the publishing of his holonovel for being a hologram.
<ul><li> A further example occurs in a <em>Voyager</em> episode where Chakotay notes that whenever Janeway fiddles with her comm badge it is a tell-tale sign that she's making a big plan. Janeway then performs the incredibly awkward-looking gesture, which she never did before or after that one moment.

The creators of the show initially wanted to portray vices more realistically, but CTV, considering Degrassi to be an educational show, forced them to make every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> show a compressed vice, allowing younger viewers to see the moral quickly, Once the show switched channels, they began portraying vices more realistically (examples: Fiona is shown to be drinking excessively for a large part of the season before being revealed as an alcoholic, Cam is shown to be suffering from depression and anxiety before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> committing suicide</span>, and Katie pops pain pills for several episodes before being sent to rehab).
</li><li> Vampire's strong vulnerability to werewolf blood in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human (UK)</a></em> Wasn't heard of and only revealed very offhandedly several series in.
</li><li> Tommy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun">3rd Rock from the Sun</a></em> is revealed in one episode to have been hiding sandwich bags full of spices to indulge his secret cooking hobby in secret. "It's marijuana. I smoke it with friends I swear!" This is never mentioned again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>: the plot of episode "C*A*V*E" is based on Hawkeye's suffering from crippling claustrophobia, which had never been mentioned before and was never referred to again.
<ul><li> In a variant, Winchester falls to the temptation to taking amphetamines, and quickly pays the price becoming addicted to them.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise Commander Straker in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UFO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UFO">UFO</a></em> episode "Sub-Smash". He develops claustrophobia on a submarine despite operating numerous times in spacecraft which should give him similar problems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheProfessionals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheProfessionals">The Professionals</a></em>: In "Klansmen" Bodie displays overt racist behaviour never shown previously by his character; it's not that such tendencies would be <em>unusual</em> in that era, especially from a decidedly working-class bloke like Bodie, but it was completely out of left-field and due to the events of the episode (in which his life is saved by a black doctor) we never see it again. Actor Lewis Collins was not pleased.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em> episode where Francis turns out to have been in AA despite never having been shown getting drunk in previous episodes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The other characters find out that he had all the signs of alcoholism <em>except</em> for drinking.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch">Baywatch</a></em> was rather terrible with this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, characters would suddenly have eating disorders, gambling addictions, PTSD from previously-unmentioned past traumas, and numerous other personal issues that would immediately disappear by the next episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>
<ul><li> An episode deals with the annoying habits of the group. The bad habits of Ted, Marshall, Barney, and Robin are noticeable prior to the episode (although Robin's misuse of the word was subtle before it was pointed out), and they still have them in later episodes. Lily's habit of chewing too loudly is a true Compressed Vice, as it appeared only for that episode. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in later episodes featuring the characters throwing "interventions" to stop each other's similar minor annoying habits: though Barney's use of magic was featured in previous episodes, other characters' habits had just never been incorporated into Future Ted's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">unreliable narration</a>.
</li><li> Lily is a frequent victim of this. One episode gave her a complete inability to aim just because the episode was about the group's blind spots in regards to common knowledge (something that doesn't even follow the main theme anyway...), and another episode claimed she had many similarities to Marshall's father just because the episode was about the psychological tendency to end up with someone like your parents.
</li><li> Another episode shows <em>all five</em> characters being habitual cigarette smokers. Previously, Barney, Robin, and Lily had been seen smoking cigars, and it was hinted that Robin smoked cigarettes, but this episode portrayed Robin as practically a chimney. The other characters don't smoke nearly as often but obviously way more than has ever been let on before. Ted's children are stunned at the news. Justified, as Future Ted on-occasion realizes he forgot to mention seemingly-obvious plot points until they became relevant to the story.
<ul><li> He's also actively editing content, most notably with his "eating sandwiches" euphemism.

</li><li> An odd example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> in that Jack's heroin addiction from season three is dealt with over multiple episodes, but since those episodes take place over one day, he really should be suffering for far more than the first few hours. But then, many examples can be taken from the show where people get over things (emotionally or physically) way faster than they should realistically be able to - Tony having major surgery after being shot but getting straight back to work just a couple of hours later, for example. The heroin thing was handwaved by Jack being given some vague other drug that would mask the withdrawal symptoms for about a day, i.e. the rest of the season, after the writers realized it was becoming more trouble than it was worth.

<ul><li> In "The Power of Madonna", the boys are suddenly shown mistreating the girls in various ways in order to set up the feminist message of the episode. This is incredibly jarring because, for instance, Artie is shown being rude and misogynistic to Tina, even though he has never displayed this attitude before.
</li><li> A few other examples include Mercedes developing a borderline eating disorder (cured by a granola bar and a "Don't worry, you're beautiful" talk), Rachel becoming self-conscious about her big nose (cured by a song and dance number), everyone becoming a heavy drinker (cured by solemn talk from Mr. Schue) and Tina all of a sudden being jealous of Rachel (cured when she's promised solos next year, which incidentally never happens).
</li><li> Ryder is suddenly revealed to have crippling dyslexia. It isn't cured or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">mentioned again</a> and he's able to read perfectly in a later season.
</li><li> At the beginning of Puppet Master Blaine inexplicably becomes an insufferable control freak, which is then promptly cured by the end of the episode.
</li><li> The latter seasons in general tended to make excessive use of this to compensate for the increasingly thin overarching story-lines.
<ul><li> Rachel learned every other episode either that she shouldn't apologize for the ambition or that sometimes friendship is more important than ambition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>.

However, he does turn back to alcohol in an episode two seasons later after he learns some devastating news, though only for that episode.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alice1976" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alice1976">Alice</a></em>, Alice, Flo, and Vera all try to help each other kick their previously-unmentioned vices: Alice eats too many sweets, Flo drinks too much coffee, and Vera <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">very uncharacteristically</a> smokes. None of these vices, or the fact that at the end of the episode, they had all <em>switched</em> vices, was ever mentioned again.

After failing to make her stop, the rest of the family comes up with an idea: They agree to watch the shopping show with her, and whenever she tries to buy something, scream "NO!" and hit her over the head (they got the idea from a pet-training guide).

The show tries to justify this by suggesting Henry only feels this way because he's worried about Charlotte taking his job as Captain Man's sidekick. However, the subplot of Charlotte becoming Captain Man's new sidekick is quietly resolved at the end of the episode, making Henry's sudden sexism subplot pointless.

Though some have come to receive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nods</a> every now and then.
<ul><li> Minor but still worth mentioning: Marge being obsessed with visiting Paris (and being occasionally disappointed when the show's constant use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacationEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacationEpisode">Vacation Episode</a> doesn't take the family there) was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> that continued long after the family actually lived there as ex-pats for an unknown amount of time (long enough to become fed up and go back to the United States) in the episode "Bart Mangled Banner".
</li><li> Another aversion is mentioned in the episode where Lisa begins having an eating disorder, due to suddenly getting body-image issues. Homer looks at her at the end of the episode, waiting for her to mention the moral she learned, but Lisa admits that - like many people - she is still suffering from these body-images and isn't sure how soon it might disappear, if at all. A few episodes still make references to her having these problems. Her being a vegetarian was also a character detail that never went away (by contractual obligation to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a></em>, even) but the show has provided a few gags that Lisa still has a love for eating meat that she has to consciously struggle against (like loving to smell the all-meat meals Homer eats).
</li><li> One of the most flagrant examples of this in the episode "Fear of Flying", which suddenly introduced Marge's titular phobia and linked it to several incidents in her childhood despite an earlier episode ("Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington") having had the family go on a flight with no incident whatsoever.
</li><li> The plot of the episode "Kill Gil, Vols. 1 &amp; 2" revolves around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser">Straw Loser</a> Gil Gunderson becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave">The Thing That Would Not Leave</a> in the Simpson house for almost a whole year because Marge is unable to tell him "no" and takes <em>that</em> long to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">build up the rage</a> to finally say it. Marge Simpson, who is the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKilljoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKilljoy">nay-sayer and nag</a> in the whole series to the point that multiple episodes either revolve around her negativity ruining the lives of everybody else in the cast or make mention that she has a well-known reputation as one among all of the people in Springfield.

</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the form of Homer's "life-long ambition" changing every time it comes up, and Marge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">pointing this out</a>.
</li><li> One episode had Bart's hellion tendencies stemming from Homer's inability to punish Bart for his bad behavior. The same Homer who routinely strangles him for misbehaving. Which was then the focus of <em>another</em> episode when he went to a parenting class because strangling Bart as punishment was inappropriate. So Bart is either a borderline sociopath (at least by Lisa's standards) <em>because</em> Homer strangles him or Homer strangling him for anything Homer perceives as a slight is <em>the one thing in the universe</em> that prevents him from literally taking over Springfield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Stewie Griffin-style</a>.
</li><li> Both Homer and Marge had separate displays of homophobia, punctuated even further by both of them showing the opposite opinion in each other's bouts. In Homer's case, he not only doesn't care about other men that he's befriended (because of plot reasons) being gay but he's so dumb that he doesn't even notice said men are gay no matter how blatant they are until another member of the family (normally whoever is the one showing discomfort <em>this</em> time) flat-out points it out to him.
</li><li> "Girls Just Want to Have Sums" has the extremely common, and extremely annoying, case of this trope where male characters become inexplicably misogynistic in order to justify a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminist</a> taking over the school so they can preach a message about gender equality. While Bart and Homer have been sexist in the past, <em>Principal Skinner</em>, despite acknowledging in the past that Lisa is the best student in the school, makes a crack about a former student's less-than-perfect math grades being because she's a girl, setting off the events of the episode.
</li><li> One episode has Mr. Burns being mistaken for an alien because he glows in the dark, thanks to his continuous exposure to the power plant's toxic wastes. This trait never comes up again.

<ul><li> Brians Got a Brand New Bag has Brian fall in love with a 50-year-old woman named Rita, and move out of the Griffins house after they keep mocking her age. For the rest of the episode, Rita suddenly starts displaying memory lapses, frailty, and outdated speech patterns that never came up before, leading to Brian having an affair with a much younger woman and ruining their relationship.
</li><li> Jerome is the New Black is well-known for Quagmires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> toward Brian, and Quagmires raging hatred of the dog would become one of his defining traits, yet there was absolutely no sign of this animosity in previous episodes, with Quagmire being perfectly fine having Brian live with him in The Tale of Two Brians one season ago.
</li><li> Speaking of Jerome, Baby Got Black portrays him as incredibly hateful toward white people to the point of opposing his daughters relationship with Chris purely because of his skin color. He fortunately learns his lesson by the end, but its still jarring when his aforementioned debut had portrayed him a cool, easygoing guy while Peter was the one who needed to get over his irrational hatred (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">over Jerome previously dating Lois</a> rather than his race).
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em> episode "Where the Rubber Meets the Road", Adam Evans, aka Rubber-Band Man, suddenly has such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">extreme dyslexia</a> that he's nearly unable to read (having to use special techniques in order to do so), and has allegedly had it since he was a child. The episode ends with Static and Adam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">giving a brief speech about dyslexia</a> and the issue is never brought up again. This is particularly egregious since Adam <em>was previously shown reading normally</em>. One previous episode even had him state "I still have all this fan mail to read" as he picks up, opens, and <em>begins to read said mail</em> - and when he's retconned into being dyslexic, the fact that none of his fan mail has been opened is the first clue that he has difficulty reading.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:

By the end of the episode, he learns how to overcome this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by Fry pointing out that Bender has never once had this problem before, to which Bender responds that every other time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">he was always lying slightly on his side.</a>
</li><li> One episode gave Bender an obsession with being remembered - something he'd never even hinted about caring about before. It does manage to become a bit of a recurring character trait tied to his ego and budding megalomania.
</li><li> Another episode parodies this. Four of Bender's ten most frequently used words were words he only used in that episode. This came with the bonus that some of said words <em>were</em> added into his regular slew of catchphrases ("Hot diggity daffodil!").
</li><li> Bender's irrational hatred of Nibbler lasts exactly one episode.
</li><li> At the beginning of "Neutopia", every male Planet Express employee is suddenly misogynist, and all the female employees suddenly act like stereotypical women. It probably was just to get the plot going, but still.
<ul><li> There's also the earlier episode of <em>Amazon Women in the Mood</em>, where Fry becomes as chauvinistic as Zapp Brannigan, despite usually being a well-meaning idiot. The two episodes are far apart enough to be a case of this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> In "Benderama", Bender is <em>psychotically</em> lazy, to the point that it's his only defining trait in that episode.
</li><li> The human crew's sudden (and inconsistent) robot racism in <em>Fear of a Bot Planet</em> is flagrant.
<div class="indent"><strong>Fry:</strong> So let me get this straight. This planet is completely uninhabited? <br/><strong>Bender:</strong> No, it's inhabited by robots. <br/><strong>Fry:</strong> Oh, kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
</div></li><li> Leela and Amy are suddenly extremely vitriolic and competitive towards one another in "The Butterjunk Effect", when they've gotten along fine in every other episode. Made even weirder by the fact that Fry states that they've always been this way. While Amy and Leela did have a somewhat vitriolic relationship before, it seemed to be mostly Amy having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> instead of her intentionally trying to piss Leela off, and Leela would normally respond with an annoyed expression. In this episode, her jabs are entirely intentional and Leela's responses are a lot more direct.
</li><li> In "The Prisoner of Benda", Amy is suddenly an extreme glutton. However, her childhood obesity was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> prior to that episode, so it's more a sudden decision to fall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheWagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheWagon">Off the Wagon</a>.
</li><li> In the first "Anthology of Interest", Leela is suddenly very inhibited and unimpulsive. While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> of the group, she definitely had moments of impulsiveness (such as ejecting a delivery mid-flight just so she could rush to do something else) and said episode stood out as even weirder as later episodes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">would make her</a> <em>overly</em> impulsive.
</li><li> In "The Sting", Leela, usually the team's voice of reason, turns out to be almost suicidally competitive, going on an unnecessary mission and putting herself and her crew in mortal danger to prove themselves superior to Farnsworth's previous crew (who died on the mission in question). This trait does recur in the episode "Möbius Dick" and the movie <em>Bender's Game.</em>
</li><li> In "The Ghost in the Machines", Fry is suddenly scared of just about everything, from parade balloons to bars of soap. This makes Bender's goal of literally scaring him to death almost too easy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope">Parodied</a> in the first few minutes of "Free Will Hunting", in which Bender fully cycles through several of these in under 24 hours in a way that would be unbelievable coming from anyone but Bender.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bender:</strong> It's been quite a journey. I dropped out of school, joined a gang, took money from a loan shark, and fell into a spiral of despair, addiction, and discount prostitution. <br/><strong>Hermes:</strong> Mon, you had one hell of a day!
</div></li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em>The New <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker">Woody Woodpecker</a> Show</em>, "Automatic Woody", has Woody dreaming about eating "Butterscotch Finger Pies", and then waking up and finding tons of empty wrappers in the various places he's stashed some for midnight snacking, and then going through lots of trouble to buy some more.
</li><li> Unfortunately, most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> is about getting a character flaw of the week that must be conquered by the end of the episode. This includes her being extremely competitive in one episode (never mentioned again) and telling white lies constantly (brought up but then presumably ignored, because it was never brought up again and she continued to do it).
</li><li> Brenda's slovenliness was revealed in the same episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeamoSupremo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeamoSupremo">Teamo Supremo</a></em> as it was cured. (At least her desire to be a famous pop singer cropped up in more than one episode.)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ProducingParker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ProducingParker">Producing Parker</a></em> episode "The Skinny on Parker" had Parker developing anorexia and immediately getting over it after being force-fed a sandwich.
</li><li> Sam Dullard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em> has two. One in the episode "The Jinx" where he causes many predicaments for everyone else due to his jinx status, something that has never been shown in episodes beforehand. The other in "Big Air" where he suffers an asthma attack despite the fact that there were never any hints showing that he had asthma in episodes before, and it is never brought up again after that episode.
<ul><li> Reggie gets one in "Reggie and a Net" where she hogs the ball during volleyball tryouts just to show her skills at the sport. The episode was to have Reggie learn a lesson in teamwork, which doesn't fit her character considering she plays street hockey with the other guys, thus already knowing how to be a team player.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Trixie Tang</a> was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">tomboy</a> who liked "boy things" but is embarrassed to show that side of her to any of her friends in the popular crowd. Like a lot of things in this show brought up in just one episode, it was never mentioned again, disappointing fans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode revolves around Hank's obsession with his guitar. Peggy claims that he pays more attention to the guitar than to her despite the fact that it's the only episode in which the guitar appears. It was eventually replaced with a similar vice: him treating the family dog Ladybird extremely well, sometimes better than he treats Bobby or Peggy. This one, however, stayed through the entire series.
</li><li> Peggy again claims that Hank was ignoring her and was spending more time with Bobby who was doing well in Home Ec., though this was more from the longer-running character flaw of Peggy that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">she has to be the center of attention and acknowledged as the best at everything, even when it's incredibly clear that she's not.</a> Bobby taking up cooking was something she supported at first until it became clear he was better at it than her and getting more attention from Hank as a result.
</li><li> They also had an episode in which the whole family took up smoking, and was over it by the end credits. It does go to the trouble of explaining that both Hank and Peggy were apparently smokers at some point in the past, at least. Hank does smoke once, in a much later episode (<em>Hanky Panky</em>) during a severely stressful situation.
</li><li> The episode "The Honeymooners" depicts Hank's mother Tilly as being selfish, wild, reckless, and out of control, she also cheats on her husband Gary whom she loved dearly and divorced him for a man she just met, the other characters act like she's always behaved this way.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama Action</a></em>, Trent demonstrates an unhealthy obsession with the number 9, which he claims he's had since childhood even though he never showed any signs of it in the previous season.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em> episode "Cellphone-itis", Beezy had a severe cell phone addiction, which is never mentioned in any other episode. Jimmy did try to help him cure it, but Beezy never even gets over his cellphone dependency; in fact, his addiction ends up saving his dad!
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em>, Dale has the same reaction to chocolate that Monty usually has to cheese. It never really comes up before or after that mission.
<ul><li> Another episode has Chip and Dale suddenly obsessed with tricking each other (followed up by shouting "Got you last, got you best!") when otherwise the only thing they really compete over is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CockFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CockFight">Gadget's affections</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Office Spaceman" reveals that Francine has a hatred of left-handed people because she was originally left-handed herself as a child, but a nun she was raised by was convinced that lefties were evil and disciplined her into using her right. At the end of the episode when Steve and Hayley get her to accept the fact she's left-handed, she tries to get used to being a lefty again and handles tasks like you would expect a right-handed person doing tasks with their left for the first time would do, from writing on the shopping list illegibly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat">slitting Steve's throat with a butter knife</a> (he got better).
</li><li> "The Wrestler" has Stan obsessed with his wrestling record from high school, with a room in his house devoted to the trophies, and Francine is sick of hearing about his wrestling career and touring his museum. Odd, then, that none of the previous 126 episodes had mentioned any of this. Lampshaded by Steve commenting that he's lived in the house all his life and has never seen the wrestling museum before.
</li><li> "Pulling Double Booty" suddenly reveals that Hayley has severe anger issues when being dumped (by "severe", we mean "rampaging death machine"), even though she was dumped by an illegal immigrant in "American Dream Factory" and harmed nobody (though she did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">immediately call the FBI to capture and deport him</a>, though it was a far more controlled tantrum she soon regretted), and yet the episode implies she's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">The Berserker</a> since she was a child.
</li><li> Lost in Space displays Jeff as incredibly neglectful toward Hayley in their relationship. Even considering that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the compilation was rigged to leave out all the good times they shared</span>, it's hard to buy that an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a> like Jeff would ever look like the bad guy at all given Hayleys more consistently callous portrayal (Stan mentions in the aforementioned Pulling Double Booty that she dumps Jeff at least once a week).
</li><li> A combination of this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers">Forgot About His Powers</a> is a main contributor of Stans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> as well as his status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a>. Many episodes will have Stan develop a completely new never before seen flaw that is usually completely contradictory to his previous skill set.
</li><li> The plot of the episode "Finger Lenting Good" pretty much revolves around this trope, where the family vows to rid their bad habits during Lent or else <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Bullock will cut off the finger of the person who cracks first</a>. The bad habits in question - Stan's constant shouting in anger, Francine's smoking habit, Steve's excessive crying, Hayley's junk food addiction and Jeff's constant hugging - only show up in this episode and never reappear.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2g9b1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2g9b1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2g9b1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Francine's smoking did pop up now and again, but seldom enough to count for this trope, and while Stan and Steve are regularly portrayed as overbearing and wimpy respectively, its not to the extent in this episode</span>
</li><li> Similarly, Dr. Klaustus focuses on the Smiths secretly disrespecting each other in ways that have never come up before: Stan has eaten out after work to avoid Francines apparently horrendous cooking for a decade (despite regularly eating her meals in other episodes), Francine steals $50 from Stans wallet for drugs every week, Hayley plays Ultimate Frisbee without Jeff because he plays it poorly (never mind that shes never shown any interest in the game before now), Jeff cannot get aroused with Hayley unless he thinks of Francine, and Steve has Greg and Terry pose as his parents in front of his girlfriend because hes ashamed of Stan and Francine. All of them are also presented as being pathologically incapable of listening to anything Klaus says unless theyre not looking directly at the talking fish; Klaus is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, but they arent usually THIS callous toward him.

They cursed just as much before and after then.
</li><li> Justified with Randy's single-episode struggle with alcoholism. He was pulled over for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkDriver">Drunk Driving</a> and forced to attend AA despite not really being an alcoholic. Impressionable joiner that he is, he takes the "admitting you are helpless to help yourself" part rather too readily to heart, and descends into full-blown dependency, convinced he has a terminal illness that forces him to drink. Though it should be noted later episodes do make him quite the alcoholic but this is the only one that focuses on it to such a degree.
</li><li> Randy again, in the episode "Holiday Special", is revealed to have been a Christopher Columbus fanboy for all of his life, and this comes to bite him back in the ass when he decides to protest Columbus Day by tearing down Columbus statues and worse. Of course, this is just another of his many quirks that were never mentioned before.

<ul><li> Finn falls into the dark, foul abyss that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">shipping</a> addiction in "All the Little People". While it only lasts an episode, there's a FOUR MONTH <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> in the middle, in which Jake moves out after finding Finn's behavior creepy.
</li><li> "Power Animal" gives Jake extreme ADHD. He has shown a short attention span in other episodes, but never to the absurd life-threatening levels shown here.
</li></ul></li><li> Goofy is randomly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em> episode "The Incredible Bulk." Despite this being a large part of the plot of this episode, it is never brought up before the episode or again and other episodes portray Goofy more logically as a <em>light</em> eater. The other characters who are more consistently played as Big Eaters (Pete and PJ to a lesser extent) are shown to be astonished by his appetite in this episode too.
</li><li> Rufus of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em> spent the majority of the series as an almost sickly sweet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a>, however on the rare occasion one of the heroes was required to say or do the wrong thing (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">usually to get the Dreamstone stolen</a>) and get handed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>, he would usually take the role.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> episode "Cover Up" reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">Buttercup</a> psyches herself up to fight crime by privately stroking a green blanket while repeatedly muttering "I am a good fighter". She's so dedicated to this ritual that she's late to helping her sisters save the day, despite flying out with them before and after this episode, and goes hysterical when the blanket disappears. Blossom tricks her with an ordinary rag, and when Buttercup gets back the real one that Professor was actually washing the whole time, her sisters shame her out of dependence. What makes this particularly odd is that Bubbles, who regularly sleeps with a stuffed octopus and keeps a large pile of stuffed animals, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">is just as judgmental as Blossom.</a>

Most evident in "Edward Strikes Out", where he suddenly develops a rather callous case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> towards Rocky. Later episodes seem to settle for making him rather self-conscious, which was at least vaguely referred to in the original episodes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">if not nearly to the same extent</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em>: In <em>Walk on the Wild Side</em>, after Scott makes an uncharacteristic joke about Damsels in Distress, Jean becomes a staunch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminist</a> who's 'sick of always being treated like the weaker sex', even though she's never been treated with anything but respect and admiration in the past.

</li><li> A few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> involve this.
<ul><li> One that sticks out is "Arthur Weighs In", where Arthur has an obesity/weight management problem when he had shown few to no signs of this in prior episodes (one would expect it to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> Buster Baxter to have this problem, and Arthur <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">looks no bigger than usual either</a>).
</li><li> Arthur also suddenly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">becomes a bully out of nowhere</a> when he continually teases Sue Ellen about her funny looking sweater in "So Funny I Forgot To Laugh", it makes it seem like Arthur, one of the least likely characters to become a bully and who was often teased by his classmates in prior episodes, was just made a bully for the sake of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about bullying. Flagrant is an apt description.
</li><li> Yet another episode, "Buster Gets Real" involves Buster giving up Bionic Bunny in favor of a reality show about employees at a supermarket because it's more true to life. This happens for no other reason than for Arthur to learn that you can still be friends with someone with different interests than you. It's especially ridiculous given that the character involved is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">the one whose most defining trait is his obsession with fantastical stuff</a>, so the idea of Buster rejecting something on the grounds of it being unrealistic is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">absurd</a>. To top it all off, Buster's like for said reality show is never brought up again, and he is seen still enjoying Bionic Bunny in later episodes.
</li><li> "Speak Up, Francine" is driven by the fact that Francine has severe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageFright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageFright">Stage Fright</a>, even though by that point in the show's run she had long been established to have no issues with being up on stage performing in front of or speaking to a bunch of people (and having done so a few times completely by herself).

</li><li> Patricia gets another in "Living Hellp" in the form of spending all her time helping the other mutants.
</li><li> Peri is usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> who causes trouble accidentally but in "Sgt. Snuggums" he is extremely cruel to Fuzzy.

When questioned why she is suddenly wearing glasses, Raven mentions she lost her contacts. The fact that Raven is near-sighted has never been alluded to in any other media, or, flagrantly, even in any other episode of <em>Go</em>.
</li><li> "Coconut Cream Pie", which very similarly spoofs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">Gilligan's Island</a></em>, has Raven playing the role of Mary Ann, giving her a strange obsession with baking coconut cream pies and trying to make people eat them.

It's so bad that even when the bus is stopped in traffic he gets ill. This has never been mentioned before or since, not even the times where he rode with his family in their car up to a campsite in "The Other Exchange Student" or in the Season 2 episode "Friendenemies" where he partied in a bus, sang karaoke, and even rode around on a white tiger (sort of) with absolutely no problems whatsoever.

</li><li> "Martha's Dirty Habit" has a main plot that is about Martha's obsessive digging. While this main plot isn't an example of the trope as she digs a lot anyway and the obsessiveness is said to be something that only happens in springtime, there's a subplot of Daniel Lorraine (Helen's dad) giving up snacking between meals and it shows that Mariella (Helen's mother) has been trying to get him to stop. Not only is there no logical reason for Daniel to stop snacking (he's not sick, doesn't have an eating disorder and is not even overweight), Mariella has never shown any disdain for his snacking before this episode.

</li><li> In "28 Pranks Later", Rainbow Dash plays various inappropriate, cruel pranks and refuses to stop when other point out that what she's doing is wrong; meanwhile, Pinkie Pie laughs at these pranks even while objecting to them. However, in the much earlier episode "Griffon the Brush Off", both were shown to have limits, with Pinkie refusing to prank Fluttershy at all because she wouldn't take it well, and Rainbow seeing Pinkie's point and agreeing not to do it.
</li><li> In the short "Starlight the Hypnotist", Twilight Sparkle is suddenly shown to have a crippling, debilitating, and completely over-the-top fear of ladybugs that dates back to a childhood incident, in spite of her <a class="urllink" href="https://derpibooru.org/1105581">being shown having no problem whatsoever with ladybugs before<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and her much-beloved "Ladybugs Awake" rhyme.

<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TinyToonAdventuresS2E8BusterAndBabsGoHawaiian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TinyToonAdventuresS2E8BusterAndBabsGoHawaiian">Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian</a>", Buster is shown to dislike riding on airplanes, even going as far as to convince the episode's writers (three then-eighth-grade girls) for a rewrite regarding the plane scene. He wasn't shown to dislike riding on airplanes when he and Babs flew back to ACME Acres from Paris, France in a previous episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TinyToonAdventuresS1E50WhoBoppedBugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TinyToonAdventuresS1E50WhoBoppedBugsBunny">Who Bopped Bugs Bunny?</a>".

In her "Babs Bunawalskioversmith" disguise, she asks the audience how humans can stand walking in high heels, suggesting she can barely walk in them. However, in a previous short, "The Amazing Three" (part of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TinyToonAdventuresS2E10LoveDisconnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TinyToonAdventuresS2E10LoveDisconnection">Love Disconnection</a>"), she has no problem walking in high heels.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampLazlo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampLazlo">Camp Lazlo</a></em> episode, "Campers All Pull Pants" involves Edward pulling down the pants of every camper in Camp Kidney, with the intention of pantsing Lazlo. In most episodes of the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfDressedCartoonAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfDressedCartoonAnimal">most of the campers don't wear pants, or underwear, for that matter</a>. In fact, Edward himself doesn't wear pants and underwear until the episode's climax.
</li><li> In the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>, there are two non-consecutive episodes in which Marinette becomes a bully...despite in every other episode of every other season being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> who regularly risks her life for people she hates. The episodes aren't part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> arc, they're just...there.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheodoreTugboat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheodoreTugboat">Theodore Tugboat</a></em> epsiode, "Emily and the Tug-of-War", George suddenly becomes sexist towards Emily. George and Emily have clashed before, but it was never over each other's gender differences. Thankfully, George grows out of this behavior at the end of the episode.
