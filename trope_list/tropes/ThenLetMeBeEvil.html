Prolonged exposure to the cynical side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a> has conditioned this character to accept the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Humans Are the Real Monsters</a>, and if they want to get anywhere in life, they have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">be every bit as dirty and cruel as they are.</a>
</p><p>The villain normally gets to this point by being rejected by the resident morality enforcers and treated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">demonization</a> and assumptive behavior. Whether it is due to being of a different nationality, hailing from a (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">stereotypically</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> species in somewhat more justified cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet">having bad things happen wherever they go</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">having had a few evil moments in the past</a>, they just <em>cannot</em> get a break; even if they try to do good deeds, it will only lead to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">horrifically punished</a> for them at worst and having them be disregarded or treated as insincere attempts at fostering good will at best. As they see it, their reputation is so tarnished that there is absolutely no way of changing anyone's mind that they are not a monster. So what is the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouTriedNotBeingAMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouTriedNotBeingAMonster">trying to be anything other than the monster which they are already seen as</a>?

</p><p>Once this trope has been declared, unlike a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil">Ambiguously Evil</a> characters, the new villains won't be redeemed in spite of their sympathetic traits  this is largely because it took a lot of work to turn them evil in the first place. Interestingly, in spite of all this, they don't look for excuses to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">kick puppies</a>  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">they still have morals</a>, they just exercise a (much) more cynical variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule">The Golden Rule</a>. That is not to say that they won't do terrible things  indeed, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> may follow. The difference is that while they may wind up doing something truly heinous or, at the very least, becoming horribly callous and ruthless, they won't go around engaging in wanton acts of needless cruelty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The trope can be played to be more or less convincing for the audience depending on what point the writer wants to make. You can have the statement come across like a cheap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> such that it feels just like the villain is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">not truly owning up to their own part in their villainy</a>. You could have it come across as a genuine explanation, but still not an excuse; either their actions were too far beyond the pale, or it is a case of "too little, too late". And then again, it could be used as a genuine exposure of mistakes society has made, or even an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">exposure and commentary of the other characters' hypocrisy</a>.
</p><p>At that last point, you might start wondering who the villain really is, and the trope enters into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a> areas. You might have fun arguing with people over the authorial intent. There are also quite a few non-evil examples on this page, whose cynicism and bitterness makes them adopt a harsh exterior to hide the kindness that they were never rewarded for.

<ul><li> Though a bit of a meta-example, this is what happened to Momonga and his guild members in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Overlord2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Overlord2012">Overlord (2012)</a></em>. Originally, he and his guild of heteromorphic-race players believed that having a guild that was exclusive to non-human PCs was a fun idea merely because it was cool and set them apart. However, over time the other players of YGGDRASIL came to view Momonga's guild (Ainz Ooal Gown) as being evil and monstrous. As Momonga and his friends were heavily into role-playing, they felt it was only proper to respect the other players' feelings and start <em>acting</em> evil and monstrous. Eventually, this led to them becoming one of the most well-known and respected guilds in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> kept lauding the statement that the Titans, also called the Subjects of Ymir, are evil and will destroy humanity if they are not eradicated. This message eventually evolves into specifically calling <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren Yeager</span> <em>the</em> devil Titan that will cause the end of humanity. Said character was already going through a phase of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> over the past few years, and the latest rendition of '<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren Yeager</span> is the devil that will destroy the world' resulted in them going through with their attack and killing innocent civilians. The world wants to see them as the devil? They will <em>be</em> the devil and start up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">the Rumbling</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to ensure that the people he grew up with in the Walls will finally live in peace and without fear of being hounded</span>.
</li><li> Though he was already an antagonist from the start, Raoh from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> didn't exactly agree with this at first, taking an interesting spin on this trope. Believing himself to be a savior who would reunite the ruined world and aspiring to become powerful enough to challenge the heavens, he went on an endless conquest with his army. However, the combination of his army's frequent corruption and his questionable sense of morality led his name to become feared worldwide, particularly among the people of Shura (who feared that he would one day cause their genocide). When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Kenshiro</a> popped up to challenge him and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">acquired the powers of Musou Tensei</span>, Raoh realized that he would have to become a demon in order to fulfil his ambitions and defeat Kenshiro. However, he eventually reforms after his final confrontation with Kenshiro, when his defeat allows him to admit that he still had some compassion left inside him.
</li><li> Gaara of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> was originally a sad, lonely boy who simply wanted a friend. But the villagers feared his power, and hated him because of its source. Finally, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Yashamaru tried to kill him</a>, on orders of Gaara's father no less, Gaara becomes exactly what Yashamaru and the villagers had always said he was: A monster that loved only itself. Fortunately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a>, and after fighting Naruto and losing, Gaara eventually regains his sanity and learns to trust and love other people again. He later even becomes the new Kazekage, and is now revered by the villagers as a hero.

He only told Gaara that nobody ever loved him, and that even his own mother hated him, because they thought the shock would make him easier to kill, an order given only because they thought he was too unstable because of the demon placed within him. When the Kazekage sees all that his son has accomplished in spite of all this, he tells him that both Yashamaru and his mother always loved him, that he is sorry for ruining his life, and that he has never been prouder of him and should have had the faith in him that his mother did.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki">Loki</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em> fits, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. It is almost always more that Loki THOUGHT that the Asgardians didn't trust him and that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> compared with Thor (combined in some continuities with the reveal that he is a Frost Giant, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> race) that caused his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, not that he was actually disliked/hated. Thor, years later after fighting as the hero to his villain, still cares enough about him to get him reincarnated after Loki engineered the near fall of Asgard <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and helped save it in a last-ditch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> has been a recurring thing for Loki when the threat gets too great for a long, long time</span>.
<ul><li> Also, there might have been a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a>, since according to some writers the Ragnarok cycle, while it existed, contained the prophecies of the Norns that wrote the fates of the Asgardians and those around them. Loki might have been dealing with the knowledge that it said he would be evil.
<ul><li> The seriousness with which the mythological factors are treated in the Mighty Thor materials varies a lot, but it is always going to be...<em>off</em> when it comes to Thor-and-Loki because it requires them to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">set of good and evil brothers</a>, which is categorically wrong in every particular way. Although Thor does seem to have been considered the safest of the Aesir to petition.
</li></ul></li><li> Since Thor destroyed the fate of the gods, and his death and rebirth <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even after the child murder, body snatching and guilt complex over it, long story</span>, Loki is determined to <em>not</em> become evil again, or at least <em>not</em> go quietly into any box others build for him, because there are forces, some even on the side of good <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like the All-Mother of Asgardia</span>, who want the status quo back and actively make his life miserable for this reason. Yeah, if he would snap now he would be perfectly justified.
</li><li> In Jason Aaron's run, he stabs Freyja with a poison knife during a civil war on Asgard between her and Odin. Freyja lives, but barely, and is in no condition to rule. Odin's brother Cul - who has a certain insight on being an evil prince - notes that to just barely keep somebody alive, Loki must be either very bad at poisoning, or very, <em>very</em>' good at it (and as it turns out, he's right). But thanks to Loki's actions, the civil war in Asgard is over, the Asgardians are united against coming threats, and Loki is the most hated man in Asgard, not Odin or Cul. As usual for Loki, he appears to be playing both sides, but making sure to give the Asgardians the villain they desire. ** Mostly these days, when he/they play the villain, it's with an additional purpose - when Tony Stark assumes that Loki's pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> again, stating that his 'phase' as an 'emo anti-hero' is over, T'Challa points out that Loki's latest scheme (involving the Celestials and the Final Host), erased the Final Host as a threat and created a new Avengers team with a giant dead Celestial as their HQ. As he once put it in <em>Young Avengers</em>... "putting together the Avengers. It's Loki's greatest hit."

All his life, people told him that he would grow up to be "a psycho killer" and he contemplates whether or not it is happening to him.

A descendant of Mxyzptlk commands everyone in the 40th century to believe that Supergirl is a criminal. Supergirl is captured with Kryptonite, tried, and sentenced to have the word "OUTLAW" branded on her forehead. Afterwards Kara is marginalized, insulted and bullied until she cracks and decides that "[She's] been branded an outlaw, so [she'll] be one!" Subverted, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she had realized that Mxyzptlk was behind everything, and she pretended to crack to fool him</span>.

</div></li><li> In the Mexican comic <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Memin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Memin">Memin</a></em> (about a poor Black boy) a story had some bullies convince him that Black people never go to Heaven, no matter how good they are (claiming that the fact there are no pictures of Black angels proves it). Memin is so angry that he swears that if he's going to Hell, he'll rule it by being the most evil kid in the world! (being a preteen his idea of evil acts are things like disrespecting his mother.) His friends hatch a plan to reform him by painting one of the angels in a Church (with the clergy's permission) Black and then show it to him. It worked.
</li><li> During a visit to Hell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane">Bane</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SecretSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SecretSix">Secret Six</a></em> discovered that despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> (at least what he thought was one) he was still damned. He figures that since he is beyond redemption anyway, he might as well stop trying to be a half-assed antihero and embraces villainy. First order of business? Settle the score with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> once and for all.
</li><li> While it never actually happens, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> comics have repeatedly teased the reader with the possiblity of Spider-Man becoming a menace due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">All of the Other Reindeer</a> mentality of the world around him. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderman">Ultimate Spiderman</a></em> comics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> was particularly worried that all of the tragedy and bad publicity in Peter's life would drive him to villainy — and given the combination of Peter's intelligence, determination, and superpowers, that would be a very bad thing.
<ul><li> The closest it came in the mainstream Marvel Universe was during the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActsOfVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActsOfVengeance">Acts Of Vengeance</a></em>, when he gained the godlike powers of Captain Universe, which he could not control, making the New Yorkers more scared of him than ever. The fact that super-villains were attacking him for no seemingly reason at all (something that was happening to the entire hero community during the crisis) only made him angrier. Finally, during his battle with the robot T.E.S.S. One, the insults from the people he was trying to help made him lose his temper, and he screamed, "You want a menace?? <em>I've got your menace right here!!</em>" And then he blew T.E.S.S. One to smithereens. (He may have eventually <em>truly</em> fallen into this trope had he not been able to win their respect by saving the city and winning their respect again - at least for a while.)
</li></ul></li><li> The Scorcher, a Spider-Man foe, reportedly started out like this. According to his origin story, research scientist Steven Jamal Hudak was framed for embezzlement by a co-worker and had to go into hiding to avoid his arrest.

At first it seemed that he would surrender and stand trial for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the murder of Charles Xavier</span>, but after spending some time in prison, he decides that he is more useful outside bars, and since he and his "Phoenix Five" team are already fugitives believed to be guilty, why not take advantage of that to go where the regular X-Men can't go, and operate outside the law?
</li><li> The original version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Blackfire</a>. As the first princess born from Tamaran's royal family in centuries, her birth was supposed to be a joyous day. Then the day she was born was marred by the Citadel destroying a city and slaughtering its three thousand inhabitants <em>in her name</em>, and a childhood illness robbed her of the ability to fly. Because of this, <em>everyone</em> hated her, treating her like a villain and passing her birthright to her little sister Starfire, who became the focus of Blackfire's rage. Then one day she snapped during training and tried to kill her sister, and was exiled... And when she returned on Tamaran, she was <em>leading the Citadel's armies to conquer the planet</em>, relenting only when Starfire too was stripped of her birthright and made her sister's slave. To add salt in the wound, it is eventually found out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blackfire is a born queen, as shown when she takes over Tamaran and quickly becomes a much better ruler than her father ever was</span>.

</li><li> Paperinik is often tempted even in the 'classic' continuity, and was extremely close to this in his early stories, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow">making people pay for the mistreatment he suffered in his civilian identity of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>.

</li><li> Fittingly, it is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a> by lord John Lamont Quackett, AKA Fantomius the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a>, whose journal would later inspire Donald into becoming Paperinik (even using his costume and, early on, his gadgets): having moved to Duckburg from his native England, the local high society treated him as a lazy do-nothing because he didn't lower himself to their hypocrisy. The day he saw one of the most important members of Duckburg's high society frame Gyro Gearloose's great-grandfather for a theft he himself had committed made him decide that the best way to deal with thieves masquerading as gentlemen was to be an actual gentleman masquerading as a thief... And on that very day he first wore the costume of Fantomius, exposed the frame-up, and <em>stole the diamond himself</em>.

In both of her origin stories, she is forced into gaining her powers. Pre-Crisis, she is coerced into helping a criminal steal some rare herbs, only for the crook to poison her with them and cause her transformation. Post-Crisis, she suffers a traumatic childhood thanks to her distant parents and gains a Ph.D. in botany, only to be seduced by Dr. Jason Woodrue and forcibly injected with toxins and poisons as a cruel "experiment." She has repeatedly attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">go straight</a> and focus on creating botanical paradises, only for various villains, such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> firebombing the island she was living on or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifter">Clayface</a> taking over her plant operations, to ruin her genuine attempts to help the world (or at least stop hurting it) and drive her deeper into insanity. It doesn't help that her powers have given her a toxic kiss, making relationships extremely difficult, and a "hyperactive immune system," which means that she can never have children. The years (and in some cases <em>decades</em>) of emotional (and sometimes sexual) abuse at the hands of men have only furthered her problems, to the point where she has essentially given up on aiding humanity at all and instead focuses strictly on the plant world, making her a kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> (who is still criminally insane). It is lampshaded in one story, when Harley Quinn (one of her few friends and occasional lover) points out that Ivy's created plants that are stronger than steel and can generate natural light, would be a huge boon to construction projects and energy crises.

We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example.

While he was lured to the Dark Side from Palpatine's manipulations convincing him he could prevent death, just about every circumstance built up to that moment. Born a slave, removed from his mother's care and later seeing her die, it was clear to him since the get-go that nobody on the Jedi Council wanted Anakin to be trained because he has the potential to become very powerful and evil. They only agree to train Anakin because Obi-Wan insisted, being the dying request of Qui-Gon Jinn. Throughout Anakin's career as a Jedi they keep him on a very tight leash and leave him out of the loop, when Anakin was placed on the Jedi Council at Palpatine's request, they denied him the rank of Master to spite him <em>and</em> Palpatine, which he took as a direct insult. Much later, he was actually on the brink of redemption with the Jedi when he informed them that Palpatine was a Sith Lord, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in a pitched battle Palpatine slaughtered several Jedi but was at the mercy of Mace Windu.

Luke came to the conclusion that he will grow up to become just as powerful and dangerous as Darth Vader. So he decided to kill Ben in his sleep, but stopped himself at the last minute, realizing he was doing the wrong thing. Unfortunately, Ben wakes up, sees his own uncle over him with a drawn lightsaber and defends himself. He kills half the other students and burns down the Jedi school Luke Skywalker was running. Luke's fear became a reality because he gave up on Ben out of fear, just like the Jedi Council never accepted Anakin out of fear.</span>

In this version, Grendel begins as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Hero</a> who develops a Nihilist worldview over time. This stands in contrast with the Danes, who are deeply religious and keep attacking him in the name of their King and God. He initially relates to them since he can understand their language and is emotionally swayed by their poetic songs, but turns on them in part because they keep attacking him
</li><li> While it's hardly the only factor, this is one of the main reasons why Jaime Lannister in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> became the cynical and amoral monster he is at the start of the series: The entire kingdom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">looked down on him</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathBreaker">breaking his oath</a> and killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">the Mad King Aerys</a>, giving him the mocking name of Kingslayer and an undeserved reputation as a scheming, treacherous backstabber- even though Aerys was about to have all of King's Landing (the capital city, with a population of about 500,000 people) burned down out of spite. After years of being called a monster for what he rightly considers his "finest act," it is not hard to see why he eventually became one, although what fans sometimes seem to forget is that <em>no-one knew what Aerys was about to do and Jaime never bothered to tell anyone</em> (maybe they wouldn't have believed him, or discounted it, but he could have tried - his father could also have used influence to spread the true story and temper the hatred, had he known). It also happened at the same time as his father sacking the city after the war had in effect already been won at the Trident, making it look like a patently obvious attempt to get on the good side of the rebels and a pointless betrayal; another theory suggests that despite the killing being a good act, Jaime must have felt deep down he deserved the scorn for the betrayal regardless, or he would have attempted to defend himself at least (possibly because he felt guilty for having stood by for plenty of Aerys' <em>other</em> horribly insane and cruel acts). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Recently, it seems like he might finally be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turning his life back around</a>, eschewing his family's toxic influence and taking a newfound pride in his honor as a knight.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jaime's younger brother Tyrion</span> seems to be heading down this road too. After being treated as a perverted monster for much of his life, he was eventually framed for murdering one of his nephews, denounced by most of his family, and branded an outlaw. This has caused him to lash out in vengeance, to kill some of his former loved ones, and to join with other outcasts.
<ul><li> Sandor "the Hound" Clegane probably qualifies as well. He is the younger son of a knight, but he was physically abused and scarred by his older brother Gregor Clegane during their childhood. Sandor has a jaded view of the world, and initially seemed content with being a hired sword for whoever happens to be in power. After losing his position in the court, he found himself targeted by people blaming him for either crimes which he committed while following orders or for the crimes of his brother. Despite his villainous reputation, Sandor is not nearly as ruthless or cruel as some of the other "knights" in this war. His reputation got even worse when a genuine serial killer impersonated him for a while.

Kovit is a zannie (an unnatural who needs to feed on human pain), one of the species on the list, who decided as a child that if the world is guaranteed to see him as a monster because of his DNA, he might as well be one and torture innocent people for his food instead of finding passive ways to get it.

His introductory episode has the characters mistreating him for no clear reason (mainly Ronon, who utterly despises all Wraith due to their wiping out his planet and putting him through years of torture), before he realizes that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Tomato in the Mirror</a> and breaks out to return to his people... but they won't accept him either, since he's still partly human.

It's hard to escape the fact that, before he came to Genoa City, Adam was relatively moral and well-adjusted. It was only after prolonged exposure to the chronic backstabbing and underhanded business dealings of the city that he started his horrific revenge plan — and at the end of that, he lapses into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment and tries to reform.

<ul><li> There's an episode in the second-to-last season where Gul Dukat tries to convince Sisko (and himself) that they really were friends all along and that he has always been misunderstood as merely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, not a true villain. Eventually, with some subtle goading from Sisko to drop his facade, Dukat realizes that he has always been a villain and decides to embrace his role by destroying Bajor and everything Sisko cares about.
</li><li> A variation also occurs in the episode where Sisko goes after the traitor Eddington. He realizes that Eddington sees himself as a hero fighting for a noble cause and decides that he has to embrace his role as the villain in Eddington's mind in order to beat him. He eventually engineers a situation that plays to Eddington's nobler instincts, forcing him to turn himself in to stop Sisko's villainy. This consisted of poisoning a Maquis planet in such a way that humans couldn't live there (but Cardassians could), essentially just balancing out the nearby world Eddington had just poisoned to Cardassians but not humans, and then threatening to do so to every Maquis settlement he could find.
</li><li> Winn Adami considers herself a very spiritual person, one who has sacrificed for her religion. In truth, she's a political manipulator, and because the Prophets know this, they have never given her visions. However, when the Pah-wraiths, the equivalent of demons in her religion, start giving her visions, she's terrified that this marks her as evil and corrupt. Kira tells her that she can achieve redemption simply by ceding her political and spiritual authority as Kai (the head of the Bajoran religion). Winn cannot bring herself to do this (couching her political machinations as "Bajor needs me."), and chooses instead to curse the Prophets and follow the path the Pah-wraiths laid out for her.

</li><li> A major theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> makes several efforts to do good and often helps Clark and others save the world, but several characters- especially Clark's parents, no less- treat him with suspicion at best because he is the son of local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> Lionel Luthor, who himself had been trying to mold his son into another ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> (whilst simultaneously letting Lex know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">just how much of a disappointment he was).</a> The latter stuff really had put the seed of evil in Lex's heart- <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Oliver Queen</a> knew Lex at school and saw him beat up his best friend (though Oliver had been a bit of a dick to both of them, mind), and a horrified Lionel covered up the fact that as a boy Lex had murdered his own baby brother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though it turned out, Lex only took the fall for his mom, who wanted to spare the child Lex's horrible childhood</span>. There is a lot of tension between Lex's natural bad side and his desire to genuinely do good getting screwed over; he is particularly annoyed that Clark, his best (and only) friend, is obviously hiding stuff from him- Clark, for his part, has thought about revealing his secret to Lex but has been dissuaded by, amongst other things, hallucinations, that make it seem like a bad idea. Not helped by the fact that the two of them are aware of a prophecy about a mortal man fighting a godlike alien and Lex believing that to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSuperman">Beware the Superman</a> might actually be sensible; after all, how can anyone be trusted with that much power?
<ul><li> Several episodes are devoted to Lex's own internal struggle. One such story inverts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a>- Lex, having been shot at Christmas, meets the ghost of his mother who shows him what happens if he changes his ways: he has a loving and happy marriage with Lana and is finally treated like a friend and family member by the Kents; Clark holds no grudge about the two of them marrying either and is happy for them and remains his best friend. Then Lana gets seriously ill and Lex can't afford it, so he goes back to his dad to ask him to help...and is promptly brushed off, meaning Lana (and their baby) both die because Lex gave up his money and his wicked father's fortune. When he wakes up, Lex decides that money and power are the only things that really matter in life, because then you can protect the people you love.
</li><li> Lionel himself gets some of this. Early in season 4 he is in prison, and tries to escape by swapping bodies with Clark. His plan fails and he ends up back in his own body by the end of the episode, but having Clark inhabit his body leaves him a changed man and after getting out of prison on a technicality anyway, tried to convince the rest of the suspicious cast, meeting the most resistance from Lex himself, who is also trying to earn everybody's trust. Things hit a head in one episode when Black Kryptonite splits Lex into his good and evil halves- the good Lex lets his father know he'll trust him and encourages him in his do-goodiness; the <em>bad</em> Lex goads Lionel into assaulting him with a poker, then says that proves he hasn't changed at all.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Storytellers</a> sometimes use this tactic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheReckoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheReckoning">Hunter: The Reckoning</a></em>. Since almost all of the mook monsters you meet actually have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">measure of humanity</a> and are enslaved to their natures or other, worse monsters, there is already a bit of a gray area to killing them in the first place. Since hunters constantly hound the monsters, cutting off their resources and food supplies, they can eventually get fed up or be driven to desperate acts of violence since their beastly side starts taking over. This could cause a normally nice vampire who only drinks just enough blood to survive, and only from animals, to become a raging beast draining the nearest humans dry. If the monster survives, you can bet he won't care much about keeping his humanity anymore. Expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">angry party members</a> who have more forgiving views of the monsters.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> there's the Refinement of Stannum in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean: The Created</a></em>, which is centered around wrath and getting revenge on the world that scorns you at every turn. Prometheans eventually draw the wrath of humanity and the suffering of nature everywhere they go, and Stannum is about focusing that wrath where it belongs. Each Refinement is a philosophy the Promethean follows during their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBecomeHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBecomeHuman">Pilgrimage</a>, and the various paths usually require some careful study before you can switch over. Stannum, however, can be entered <em>instantly</em>, and is usually entered when some Promethean goes, "Oh, <em>fuck</em> this shit."
<ul><li> And a step below <em>that</em> is the path of Centimani, the Refinement of Flux. Flux is a force of dissolution and mutation, and the Centimani themselves are focused on monstrosity rather than rebirth. Prometheans on this path have not only given up on trying to be good, they've given up on trying to be anything resembling a human. In a subversion however, some Prometheans see Centimani as a way to humanity just like the others.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1t1eq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1t1eq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1t1eq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The logic being, 'to be human, you must learn the atrocities that humans must <em>not</em> do'.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>: The Imperium <em>loves</em> causing this.
<ul><li> It is said that to betray the Imperium is the heretical work of Chaos. After all, the Emperor Protects, and His Imperium provides for all. So who cares if you grew up on a world with a 95% conscription rate, if your local sub-System governor cut off all incoming supplies to your desert planet because the local figurehead didn't want to marry off his only daughter to the guy, or if you only accepted the help of that one benevolent alien race in fighting off the far-less-benevolent alien race because the Imperial Guard/Space Marines wouldn't arrive for, oh, fifty years. The response will still be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">BURN, HERETIC</a>, so if you'll be condemned for being a pawn of Chaos anyway, you may as well get the fun powers (and horrid mutations) that go with it.
</li><li> Mutants usually arise from non-Chaotic sources, such as exposure to rubber-science radiation, but are <em>at best</em> barely tolerated and the victims of severe discrimination because it's feared that they will turn to Chaos. For some reason, having it made clear for your entire life that you're one slip-up away from the stake means that when a cult teaches your differences are in fact holy, you're statistically very, very likely to be on board with that - meaning that you do, indeed, turn to Chaos. Then again, many mutants <em>do</em> turn to Chaos or are tainted by Chaos at birth, meaning the Imperium's attitude is usually the correct one.
</li><li> More than once, Space Marine Chapters have been accused of treachery on scanty evidence, leading to them ending up genuinely in the hands of the Dark Gods, most notably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulDrinkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulDrinkers">Soul Drinkers</a> (although they later gained a form of redemption).
</li><li> More than one Primarch was a victim of this during the Horus Heresy.
<ul><li> Most notable was Konrad Curze, who was cursed with visions of the galaxy falling into eternal bloodshed and himself being executed as a traitor by an agent of the Imperium. After his one sincere attempt to seek help from his brothers was violently rebuffed, he decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">embrace his fate</a>.
</li><li> Part of the reason Mortarion slipped into heresy was his steadfast opposition to use of psychic powers, which he viewed as sorcery in all cases. When a daemon makes it clear that his "clean" wards and counteragents are useless, Mortarion unleashes his own sorcerous might to destroy it and vows to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">master the practice himself</a>.
</li><li> Magnus the Red seems to be slipping this way. He intended to let himself be executed for his defiance of the Decree of Nikaea, but when it came to the end watching his world and sons be destroyed angered him too much to do this. Since he's now banished, friendless and trapped in the power of the Chaos Gods, he might as well embrace it.
</li><li> Alpharius may end up a victim of this. The Alpha Legion embraced treason for the greater good of the galaxy, but by the 41st millenium they all seem to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">card-carrying villains</a>. Of course with the Alpha Legion, who really knows.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Often the case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> as well. Village witches, alchemists, and various others are all too open to accusations of being in league with Chaos, at which point they generally have nothing left but to either die or actually go over to Chaos.
<ul><li> Those who start mutating later in life are usually hidden away by their families, until they get chased out by the rest of the townsfolk, join a band of mutants/beastmen, and lead them right back to the village that kicked them out. In the case of beastmen, mutants quickly find that they might have had better luck staying with the village, as beastmen view human-born ungors as expendable slaves and emergency food.
</li><li> Archaeon the Everchosen combined this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>. Archaeon was originally a devout Sigmarite who found out about a prophecy about the birth of the Everchosen, the greatest champion of Chaos ever to live. He travelled around the world trying to find and kill the child, only to realize to his horror that the prophecy was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">about him</a></em>. He then tried to kill himself, but when he tried to stab himself and his dagger bent, he took this as a sign that he would never be free of Chaos, and might as well serve them as best he could.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fiend-blooded Tieflings are prone to this. While they are no more predisposed to good or evil than their human kin, enough people treat them as if their heritage makes them intrinsically evil that they often give up trying to be decent to their abusers. Compare their Aasimar counterparts, who sometimes get so worn down by the assumption that their celestial blood means they must be paragons of good and justice that they end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">bobsledding off the slippery slope</a>.
</li><li> Warlocks are born with magical gifts from unspecified dark powers, ranging from powerful fey to actual demon lords, and are commonly treated as evil by default on the basis of their gifts being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">a bit spooky</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">Consequently</a>, there are a lot of evil warlocks.
</li><li> Chromatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Dragonborn</a> will usually end up in situations like this, given that Chromatic dragons tend to fall between being instinctual feral beasts or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> pillagers amassing hordes and terrorizing towns, it shouldn't surprise anyone when being called a monster all their life makes them decide to follow in their dragon parent's footsteps. In some sources adopting this outlook will even cause their Dragon parent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">finally acknowledge them as their offspring</a>... unfortunately for their tormenters who while prepared to fight a dragon<em>born</em>, probably can't fight a <em>dragon</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> It takes a lot for the samurai of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Rokugan</a> to betray their Emperor. The Code of Bushido is very clear- if you betray your lord, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">you must kill yourself to restore your honor</a>. So imagine how bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Hantei XVI</a> was to have <em>his entire personal guard</em> turn on him and slay him- in their minds, bringing dishonor on themselves and their family and having to commit seppuku was a preferable fate to letting Hantei XVI stay in charge.

When Shylock sees the opportunity to get revenge on Antonio and do it legally, he jumps at the opportunity, even though he knows it is villainous: As he states at the end of his famous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouThinkICantFeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouThinkICantFeel">Hath not a Jew eyes?</a>" speech, "The villainy you teach me, I will execute."

I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage.

Because of this wrongful arrest, he is permanently tagged as a criminal, and whatever hopes he had for a bright future are ruined.

However, rather than take revenge on everyone, they instead focus on their personal grudges, before moving on to various corrupt high-notoriety figures.
<ul><li> The protagonist saves a woman from being assaulted by a man with extreme power and influence, who threatens her into making false testimony against him, earning him an arrest, criminal record, getting him put on probation and ruining pretty much any but the slightest hope of a bright future.

Not many were convinced, and he even set up a charity to help the victims of his past crimes after one of them tried to kill him. Then his body starts failing, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his doctor/girlfriend decides to try and knock him unconscious and use his organs to see what went wrong. Freeze barely survives, and goes back to revenge again, killing his traitorous girlfriend, and planning to blow up the Wayne-Powers compound, threatening to kill hundreds more, with him along with it</span>. While in the animated movie <em>Sub Zero</em>, which took place decades earlier, Freeze had finally achieved his goal of saving the life of his wife and seemed to have undergone a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> as a result of that (he also tells Batman and co. to save some children rather than save him when he is badly injured on an exploding oil rig) in the following series, <em>The New Batman Adventures</em>, his body is falling apart and he decides that even though his wife is alive and happy, if he can't be happy with her he is going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutThemAllOutOfMyMisery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutThemAllOutOfMyMisery">make the lives of everyone in Gotham as miserable as possible</a>, culminating in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> plot. It's understandable if Freeze isn't wholly trusted.

Sightly unhinged, the Riddler ends up finding love in college with his science partner. She ultimately ends up sabotaging him, sending him down a path of villainy all so she could take all the profit from the experiment for herself.
</li><li> This was Jinx's motivation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>. Because she had the power to cause bad luck, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople">she thought evil was the only option for her</a>. Kid Flash eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">pulls her out of that belief</a>.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> had the crew make a delivery to a giant ugly monster. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">Bender continuously insults him</a>, but the guy remains calm and composed and takes the barbs in gentle stride.

Too bad insulting his mama was his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>. Later, the giant comes to Earth to try and apologize for his outburst. Unfortunately, the world's water supply had been turned into alcohol and everyone acts drunkenly agressive towards him. The giant finally snaps and goes on a rampage.
<div class="indent"><strong>Giant</strong>: I won't stop until your whole planet is as ugly as you perceive me to be!

<ul><li> In the episode "Brian: Portrait of a Dog", a homeless Brian tries begging a guy for change, but the guy assumes that he is crazy. Brian gets pissed off and shows him just how a crazy dog acts.
</li><li> Similarly, after spending several episodes as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBallMagnet">Villain Ball Magnet</a> to Quagmire, and facing gratuitous outbursts and criticisms, Brian has started to snap back, committing genuinely callous acts against him such as stealing his dream girl or scamming him out his life savings, complete with Quagmire having the nerve to exclaim that he did not think he was <em>that</em> low before.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Scott, the Canadian dick, was an overbearing jerk that wanted Terrence and Phillip gone, but did nothing more than that other than being a jerk to people. Everyone else calls Scott a dick because of his jerkass attitude, which eventually got to him in "Royal Pudding" after he becomes a giant:
<div class="indent"><strong>General</strong>: You're a dick, Scott! You have always been a dick! And then you got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now you're a GIANT DICK! <br/><strong>Scott</strong>: Well, you kept calling me a dick, so that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
</div></li><li> This may also be the case for the Ginger Kids, after being ostracized and shunned for their appearances. They then formed the Ginger Separatist Movement, after being influenced by Eric Cartman of course.
</li><li> Heidi Turner also had this case as well. After being mock by her friends for going out with Cartman, she lets him manipulate her and become his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She snaps out of it in "Splatty Tomato"</span>

Their betrayal led him to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">racist</a> towards the two-leggers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>:
<ul><li> The poster girl for this trope is undoubtedly Chloe Bourgeois.

After numerous attempts to work with Ladybug and even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">resisting an akuma</span>, Ladybug never answers the call and this partially caused Chloe to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">commit a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face-Heel Turn</a> and work with Hawkmoth.</span> It ends up getting her kicked off the team (supposedly) permanently. Many say she's responsible for her own actions, but there's also a fair bunch who blame Ladybug for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">glaring ineptitude</a> in handling the situation. So perhaps her actions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">weren't as unreasonable</a> as one would think.

So she dedicated herself to becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain">Daddy's Little Villain</a>, proving to both her Mother and Zuko that she doesn't need their love, as being feared is the only thing that matters.

</li><li> Barely averted in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>. After the Gargoyles heroically fought to protect Castle Wyvern and the refugees inside from the barbarian hordes, Lexington, Brooklyn, and Broadway are treated with disdain and called monsters by the very people they risked their lives to protect. They conclude that if the humans are going to treat them as monsters, "Then perhaps we'd better live up to the name", and they begin to advance menacingly on the refugees. Luckily Goliath stops them before they do...whatever terrible thing they were planning to do.
<ul><li> Most likely a good-natured spooking. But you know, slippery slope and all that. A better example would be Demona: Humans not giving the clan respect?

When Spike comes to apologize to Thorax, Thorax calls himself "an evil Changeling" apparently ready to give up on friendship. Luckily, Spike says that he is sorry and the two make amends, revealing their friendship to the empire; successfully convincing them that not all Changelings are evil.
