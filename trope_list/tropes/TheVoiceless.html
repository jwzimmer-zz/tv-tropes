<ul><li> Joe Tetsuma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>.
</li><li> Keith Gandor of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> doesn't speak throughout the entire anime series, despite being a main character and frequently appearing. This is taken to a much larger extreme in the light novel series, which mentions that he has a tendency to go <em>years</em> without talking. The irony of this would be that, even with his muteness ramped up to eleven, Keith actually <em>does</em> get an in-scene line in the first book: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "That guy's an idiot."</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kamemon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em> starts out as this, but the real winners are the two PawnChessmon. They actually have to have Miki and Megumi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">call their attacks</a> and announce their evolution, but Kamemon is just shy. So shy that everyone stares at him in shock when he finally speaks a full sentence, and he retreats into his shell. Which is cute, but the real hilarity is in the finale: Megumi and Miki take the PawnChessmon to sing karaoke... off-screen.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWarsTheYoungHuntersLeapingThroughTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWarsTheYoungHuntersLeapingThroughTime">Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Leaping Through Time</a></em>, a very large number of the involved returning protagonists - specifically Yamato, Gabumon, Mimi, Palmon, V-mon, Wormmon, Guilmon and Renamon - have no speaking parts whatsoever. It's particularly egregious because this is a franchise that is heavy on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">Calling Your Attacks</a>, and some of their original voice actors ARE involved in this series so it can't always be a matter of being unable to rehire the voice actors.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, Ginkotsu speaks very rarely, more often communicating in a grunt (typically written as "gersh"). After several episodes in a row of nothing but grunting, he surprises everyone by speaking in full sentences just before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">self-destructing to protect Renkotsu</span>.
</li><li> Nonette Enneagram in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, somewhat outstanding in that she is truly voiceless — in her two very brief appearances across 25 episodes, she never says a word.
</li><li> The Captain from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> says <em>not one word</em> throughout the series. His speech bubbles consist entirely of "..." He has exactly <em>one</em> line in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">The Dawn</a></em>. Unless that speech bubble is meant to be attributed to Dok.
</li><li> Isao from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsKichijojiTheOnlyPlaceToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsKichijojiTheOnlyPlaceToLive">Is Kichijoji the Only Place to Live?</a></em> never speaks aloud. The most he does is mumble, without speech bubbles, to the main characters who seem to be the only ones who can understand him.
</li><li> In the second filler arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Enryū doesn't speak until the end of the story line, at which point the giant imposing guy is revealed to have a voice that would make Alvin the Chipmunk blush.
</li><li> Brandon Heat, the main character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave">Gungrave</a>.</em> He says maybe three things in the whole series. Because in the video game series that the anime is based upon, Brandon (and his later persona Beyond the Grave) doesn't talk <em>at all</em>....<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> except for one and only one line at the end of the second game</span>.
</li><li> Meru Otonashi ("no sound") from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em> is voiceless unless extremely provoked (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">in which case you'd better run for your lives</a>). She makes up for it by being a very proficient text spammer.
</li><li> Sumiyoshi in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> anime talks, but soundlessly. His lines are visible on the screen just as his lines were written in the manga (i.e., right next to his head, without word bubbles).
</li><li> In spite of having a voice actor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Rusty Mackenzie</a> doesn't have a single line in the series. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheTypicalGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheTypicalGundamSEEDDestiny">The Typical Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> takes this a step further when he's cloned. If any of his clones so much as <em>tries</em> to speak, they will die from some contrived fashion <em>even</em> if all they say is "...".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>, Lau's favorite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold">girl</a> is this trope in the anime, but in the manga, Ranmao is simply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute">Cute Mute</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissFanservice">Miss Fanservice</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">... she needs more screentime, her and Lau</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> Me-Mania of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PerfectBlue">Perfect Blue</a></em>. There are only two scenes in which he has any dialogue at all, and in one of them he's just mumbling to himself.
</li><li> In a sense, Haibara-san of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoraba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoraba">Mahoraba</a></em>. Speaks with ventriloquy through his dog puppet, Johnny, but never says anything as himself (and claims that Johnny is an actual other being). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though he was not always this way, as revealed through flashbacks, and says a single sentence in the actual plot's timeline as himself for impact.</span>
</li><li> Kuchinashi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NEEDLESS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NEEDLESS">NEEDLESS</a></em> only speaks once in the series when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's calling out her ultimate attack and everyone is more surprised she spoke than about the actual attack.</span> She uses a notebook to communicate through the series, often times having sarcastic comments.
</li><li> Muu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLuciferAndBiscuitHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLuciferAndBiscuitHammer">The Lucifer and Biscuit Hammer</a></em> is a bit of a subversion, in that he's a crow, so he shouldn't be able to speak, but he's also the animal familiar of one of the Beast Knights, and all the other familiars can talk, so why not him? Thus there's some doubt among the characters as to whether Muu conforms to this trope or if he's simply incapable of speech (though he certainly displays human intelligence in other ways.) This is eventually settled when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Muu finally speaks in front of everyone right before he vanishes forever at the end of the war. We also learn from Muu's voice that she was a female all along.</span>
</li><li> The Baker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></em> has one line in the entire film. "Oi" which is little more than a grunt.
</li><li> Many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider">Giant Spider</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders">Spider Riders</a></em> rarely ever spoke. The fact is actually lampshaded by the characters themselves on a few occasions.
<div class="indent"><strong>Spider Shadow:</strong> You don't talk much, do you Flame? <br/><strong>Spider Flame:</strong> ...<em>silence</em>...
</div></li><li> The fisherman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WhenMarnieWasThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WhenMarnieWasThere">When Marnie Was There</a></em>. Apparently he hasn't said a single word for quite some time but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">breaks his silence at the end</a> when hearing the name <em>Marnie</em>.
</li><li> The Child from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>. While he does not speak in his human form <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when the body of light appears before Guts — which only appears when the Child is around — when he is on the verge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">becoming a monster</a>, it does speak.</span>
</li><li> Mayu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MoritaSanWaMukuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MoritaSanWaMukuchi">Morita-san Wa Mukuchi</a></em> rarely speaks because her mother said to think before speaking. As a result she spends too much time thinking and misses the opportunity to speak. Luckily her friend Miki can usually guess what she wants from her facial expressions.
</li><li> Mitobe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke">Kuroko no Basuke</a></em>. He never says a word (and if I recall correctly, he doesn't even have a single bubble with ellipses in the whole manga). Played with in a scene where he's shown eating with his family, who all seem to be chatterboxes. Lampshaded in the first episode of the anime (not in the manga though), when they're getting people to join the basketball club:
<div class="indent"><strong>Koganei:</strong> Mitobe, make sure they hear you! <br/><em>[Mitobe grins at him, then turns back]</em> <br/><strong>Koganei:</strong> You're not gonna do it, are you?
</div></li><li> Egypt from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> may fit this trope. He's never spoken a word in the anime or the manga, and the only thing he's done on screen yet was deliver a mild beat down to Italy with a stick and his fist. All without saying a word.

The latter incident is recorded by the narrator as an important historical event would be, and his fellow admirals are shown to be shocked by the fact that he is actually capable of speech.

<ul><li> Teller, of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PennAndTeller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PennAndTeller">Penn &amp; Teller</a>, is known for never speaking in their various shows and specials. Teller created this gimmick after realizing that people pay closer attention if he kept silent while performing at parties.
<ul><li> He sometimes speaks on camera for television series on magic, though he kept his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">his face completely obscured</a>. He also talks openly off camera, such as while meeting fans after live performances, and in non-performance contexts such as radio interviews, lectures, and panel discussions like at The Amazing Meeting.
</li><li> An exception is at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PennAndTellerGetKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PennAndTellerGetKilled">Penn &amp; Teller Get Killed</a></em>.
</li><li> A notable exception to this can be found in the Egypt episode of <em>Penn &amp; Teller's Magic And Mystery Tour</em>. Teller speaks quite frequently there, on camera and in full view.
</li><li> On his radio show, Penn Jillette revealed that Teller talks during every live show at least once, but it has to be a gimmick. Examples include arguing with Penn off-mic, speaking as an animatronic dummy of himself, or narrating his magic act aloud while an industrial wood chipper is drowning him out.
</li><li> The speech-plus-gimmick format is retained in their TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PennAndTellerBullshit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PennAndTellerBullshit">Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!</a></em>; Teller does speak occasionally, but he's usually facing away from the camera or has something in front of him. (One memorable example has Penn standing alone on the set, referencing the kiddy rhyme "Liar, liar, pants on fire"; Teller runs by in the background with his own pants actually on fire, screaming in ostensible terror.)
</li><li> They used his voice when he appeared in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. Just long enough to proclaim, "I'm not the first Teller!"
</li><li> The wood chipper example illustrates that Teller's silent act is a subversion of the typical magician's trope of stating the obvious throughout one's act: "I'm putting these needles on a thread, and I'm going to swallow them now..." Earlier in his career, it also made his act heckle-resistant, which was important when he was performing alone at frat parties. He later teamed up with Penn, who could simply shout over any crowd noise, but stayed silent so that they could maintain the integrity of their separate acts.
</li><li> In his book <em>God, No!: Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales</em>, Penn mentions that people at their shows do hear Teller occasionally say a few things. Then they will go back to their families and friends and tell them that Teller <em>never</em> speaks. It's part of the show, kinda like how people don't actually want to see the magic of a trick undone.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PennAndTellerFoolUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PennAndTellerFoolUs">Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us</a></em>, Teller can often be seen speaking to Penn while discussing the tricks they've just witnessed, but his voice is inaudible to the camera.

<ul><li> Silent Bob, who earns his nickname. If you pull the string on Silent Bob's action figure, nothing happens. Each film has about one instance of him talking, ranging from a profound monologue (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Clerks</a></em>) to an Indiana Jones impression after throwing someone off a train (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em>) to him just finally losing it with Jay's stupidity (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JayAndSilentBobStrikeBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JayAndSilentBobStrikeBack">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a></em>). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClerksII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClerksII">Clerks II</a></em>, when in jail at the end and having to figure out what to do, Jay says to Bob, "That's your cue, man!" - to which Bob <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tries to think of something, then just shrugs it off with "I've got nothing"</span>.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy">Chasing Amy</a></em> he starts gearing up for his speech when Jay gripes that, oh look, Bob's opening his mouth, motherfucker thinks that just because he never says anything that one time he motherf***ing says something he thinks it's so motherfucking profound. Bob points out that he at least has a leg up on Jay, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkativeLoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkativeLoon">who talks all the time and yet has never said anything remotely meaningful</a>. It's notable in being the movie that Silent Bob has the most lines by far.
</li></ul></li><li> God, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em>, since living humans would die instantly if they ever heard her speak out loud; the Metatron has to speak for her. (Bob also says "Thanks" to her near the end.)
</li></ul></li><li> One of the holders of the Pieces of Eight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</a></em> never spoke, but as it turned out, it was because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he actually had a very high-pitched, squeaky voice.</span>.
<ul><li> Cotton, one of Jack's crew members, also never speaks, since his tongue was cut out. He speaks through his parrot instead (which isn't a very good speaker).
</li></ul></li><li> Several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> villains:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em>, the villain's hulking, Korean bodyguard Oddjob apparently lacks the ability to speak English, so he doesn't talk, but simply <em>not</em> talking only makes him more intimidating. The only sound he makes is screaming when he is electrocuted while trying to retrieve his metal hat when bond electrocutes the metal bars the hat is stuck in.
</li><li> Vargas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball">Thunderball</a></em> is never heard speaking. He only screams <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">when Bond shoots him with a harpoon gun</a>.
</li><li> Jaws from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpyWhoLovedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpyWhoLovedMe">The Spy Who Loved Me</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker">Moonraker</a></em>. At the end of his second film appearance, he has one line of dialogue when preparing a toast to his bespectacled girlfriend as the rocket ship is heading back to Earth. He says, "Well, here's to us." (Possibly, the reason he doesn't speak is because his metal, cybernetic teeth make talking difficult, but that is just a theory.)
</li><li> Another Bond example: Emil Locque, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Professional Killer</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly">For Your Eyes Only</a></em>. We see him speaking on the phone at one point, but we cannot hear him. He later screams in terror when Bond kills him. Otherwise, he is silent.
</li><li> Patrice from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em> is the most recent example. He doesn't say a word, even when he is asked by Bond who he's working for, he desires not to speak and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">plummets to his death.</span>
</li><li> Mr. Hinx from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>, a hulking henchman not unlike Oddjob and Jaws, says only one word throughout the film, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">"Shit."</a>, only before being killed by Bond.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Colby (Lee Van Cleef) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighNoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighNoon">High Noon</a></em>, seems to speak at the beginning, but has no lines beyond a few harmonica tunes.
<ul><li> Not to be confused with Charles Bronson's similarly harmonica-bound character in <em>Once Upon A Time In The West</em>, who was more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Harpo of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Marx Brothers</a> built his professional persona around pantomime. As a youth, his Uncle Al wrote him a vaudeville part that was silent, but Harpo insisted on ad-libbing some lines. Afterwards, he read a review that said his excellent pantomime was spoiled once he started talking. Thereafter, he never spoke in a performance again, and very rarely allowed his voice to be recorded. However, he does audibly sneeze in <em>At the Circus</em> and might be harmonizing "Sweet Adeline" with his brothers in <em>Monkey Business</em>.
<ul><li> According to Joe Adamson in <em>Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers</em>, the producers of their next-to-last feature, <em>A Night in Casablanca</em>, wanted to give Harpo a single spoken line — a scream of "Murder!" — so they could promote the film with "Harpo Speaks!" Harpo listened to the proposal, thought it through, and shook his head. (However, he did like the proposed tagline enough to use it as the title of his autobiography.)
</li><li> If you're curious what Harpo sounded like, some recordings of his voice can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.harpomarx.net/talking.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Stanley, the title character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis">Jerry Lewis</a>' <em>The Bell Boy</em>, doesn't say a word until the very end of the film (although Lewis, in a dual role, also appears as himself and speaks while doing so).
</li><li> Lane's super-genius kid brother Badger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BetterOffDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BetterOffDead">Better Off Dead</a></em> never says a word on-screen, which doesn't seem to keep him from picking up trashy women. There's also a young Asian immigrant who never speaks because he doesn't know any English - although his brother does, and talks like Howard Cosell, thanks to repeated viewings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WideWorldOfSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WideWorldOfSports">Wide World of Sports</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Kroenen</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2004">Hellboy</a></em>, on account of removing his lips, among other things. His character is completely different in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBook">Comic Book</a> and can speak quite well.
</li><li> Vega in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> movie; he only speaks with his mask on or off screen. In the games, he can indeed talk whenever he wants. This sparked a rumour that the actor who played him couldn't speak English or was mute.
</li><li> Chief Bromden in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneFlewOverTheCuckoosNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneFlewOverTheCuckoosNest">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a></em>, ostensibly deaf-mute, eventually reveals to McMurphy that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability">faking it</a>.
</li><li> Tiny never speaks in either <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOf1000Corpses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOf1000Corpses">House of 1000 Corpses</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsRejects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsRejects">The Devil's Rejects</a></em>. This may be because he's completely covered in burn scars and can't hear very well.
</li><li> Nishi (played by Kitano Takeshi) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HanaBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HanaBi">Hana-bi</a></em>.
</li><li> Han-gi in <em>Bad Guy</em> by Kim Ki-duk. When he does eventually speak, his voice turns out to be a hoarse whisper.
</li><li> The two protagonists of <em>Film/3Iron</em>, also by Kim Ki-duk, share a romance through the entire film without ever speaking a word.

Reportedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating">to avoid a PG rating an F-word was added on the soundtrack just before his demise to bump it up to PG-13</a>.
</li><li> Mrs. Peel's clone doesn't say a word in any of her appearances on screen.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the comedy writers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFavoriteYear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFavoriteYear">My Favorite Year</a></em> says nothing up until the film scene, when he finally blurts out, "Oh God, this makes me happy!"
</li><li> In the Scottish comedy <em>Gregory's Girl</em>, the character of Charlie doesn't speak until the final scene, when he point out that the capital of Venezuela is misspelled.
</li><li> The bounty hunters chasing Hulk Hogan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuburbanCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuburbanCommando">Suburban Commando</a></em> are large, muscular and silent — until one(played ironically by Mark "The Undertaker" Calloway)speaks in a squeaky, girly voice, prompting Hogan to remark, "No wonder you guys never talk!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldenChild">The Golden Child</a></em>, as a Buddhist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messiah</a> figure, never speaks until the very end, after he's been rescued.
</li><li> Mitch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Waiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Waiting">Waiting...</a></em>, for the most part.

</li><li> Even after the introduction of sound, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>'s Little Tramp character didn't speak. The first time we hear the Tramp's voice is when he sings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ModernTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ModernTimes">Modern Times</a></em>. Chaplin chose to have the Tramp sing gibberish so he could continue to cross all language barriers. The only time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTramp">The Tramp</a> speaks clearly is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator">The Great Dictator</a></em>, which is also the last appearance of the character.

According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, her silence was to avoid the character becoming the usual sardonic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick">Kid Sidekick</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, a translation of her first rant reveals that Laura willfully <em>chose</em> to remain silent around Logan; when she blows up at him she pointedly asks why he expects her to talk to him, when all he's done the entire film is yell at her, insult her, or try to abandon her.

He does snarl at the Frog brothers prior to this, but it's inarticulate growling, not words.

Oddly, the filmmakers went to the trouble of casting a French actor even though we never hear his accent.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween">Halloween</a></em> series Michael never spoke and only ever uttered generic noises like grunts, which themselves are barely audible in most cases. In the remake series Michael's shown to talk, but only as a child. That is until the director's cut for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalloweenII2009">Halloween II (2009)</a></em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he screams "DIE!" at Loomis before stabbing him multiple times.</span>

(The closest he came was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saying "Ow!"</span> in the third movie.) He wouldn't even talk in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddyVsJason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddyVsJason">Freddy vs. Jason</a></em> pre-movie conference when asked a question. This was even lampshaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet">Freddy himself</a>, which served to piss Jason off.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHumanCentipede" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHumanCentipede">Human Centipede</a></em> films have a couple such characters. In <em>First Sequence</em>, the cop named Voller never utters a word, merely staring piercingly (something between a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare">Kubrick Stare</a>) but it's assumed he can talk.

It is mostly a silent film where we can't hear characters speak except in inter-titles. However, in a dream sequence, we find that suddenly the world has sound (which we can hear), except that our hero finds he cannot speak, despite trying to. At the very end of the film he speaks, audibly, for the first time - indicating that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he has now accepted the inevitability of people talking in movies</span>. We are also surprised by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the fact he has a strong French accent</span>, which may explain earlier reluctance to appear in talkies.

Though she's able to, for some unclear reason she'd prefer not to, perhaps as a means of defying her mother (who didn't want her to learn sign language, and would likely have wanted Ariana only speaking).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Swashbuckler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Swashbuckler">Swashbuckler</a></em>, neither the lute player nor the Woman of Dark Visage utter a word while they are on the screen.

<ul><li> An old joke goes: there was a boy who never spoke. As he grew up, his parents took him to doctors, specialists, healers; there appeared to be no physical reason for his silence, but no one was ever able to make a dent in it. Finally they gave up and accepted him for what he was. One day when he was 13, the family was eating dinner, and the boy suddenly spit it out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking">loudly proclaimed</a>, "This soup is terrible!" His parents were shocked. "You can speak?" "Of course I can. Why wouldn't I be able to speak? Perfectly normal thing to do." "Then why have you been silent all these years?" "Well, up to now, the soup's been pretty good."
</li><li> Some monks and nuns who have taken a vow, like the famous trappists. This is occasionally made fun of, like in this joke: A woman wants to become a trappist nun. Since she is a novice, she is allowed to speak two words per week (or month, or year, depending on the version of the joke). The first time she is allowed to speak, she says "bed hard", so she gets a softer mattress. The second time she says "food cold", so they care for this problem too. The third time, she says "I leave."

This was actually an inversion. Expanded Universe novels have shown that these droids are perfectly capable of speech, but are usually simply told not to by whoever is conducting the interrogation, because a torturer who remains silent can be far more effective than one who speaks to the victim.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sekhmet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sekhmet">Sekhmet</a></em>, Henrik, Nathanael, and Cassandra never speak. Though Cassandra growls and Nathaniel squeaks.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DaughterOfTheForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DaughterOfTheForest">Daughter of the Forest</a></em>, based on the traditional fairy tale, a girl must rescue her brothers after they have been turned into swans by her evil stepmother. To do so she must not speak (or, it seems, make any vocal sound, not even sobs or cries of pain) until she has made seven shirts for them out of what are essentially sharp thistled plants. She manages it, but it causes her quite a few troubles, including one man's death because she could not speak up at the appropriate time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany">The Chronicles of the Black Company</a></em>, one of the company wizards (called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Silent</a>) is quite the embodiment of this trope.

</li><li> In <em>The Dragonslayer's Apprentice</em>, the dragonslayer's assistant Ron is like this; he says little, if anything, and has mastered the art of nonverbal communication. He says so little that when the titular apprentice fills her boss in on the details of a celebration he got a little too drunk at, a big deal is made of Ron commenting that he likes the sausages.
</li><li> A running joke in John Morgan Wilson's <em>Benjamin Justice</em> series. Fred, one of Justice's elderly landlords, has virtually no dialogue, beyond the occasional grunt.

</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudyBlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudyBlume">Superfudge</a></em>, baby sister Tootsie is too young to speak until the end, when she starts imitating the "Yuck!" that Peter utters while changing her diaper. Her timely repetition of "Yuck!" is later misinterpreted as "York!" by the rest of the family, which helps them reach the decision to move back to New York City ("Nu yuck!").

</li><li> John Marsden's <em>So Much To Tell You</em> is written as a diary by a girl called Marina. Before the book starts, she was horribly disfigured when her father threw acid in her face (while aiming for his wife). She hasn't spoken since, and does not break her silence until the final chapter when she visits her father in prison and announces that she has "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">So much to tell [him</a>]."

</li><li> Marietta Edgecombe, despite being infamous of her one act of being a tattletale, never says anything on"screen".
</li><li> Also the Bloody Baron. One can assume Harry has heard him speak, since he impersonates him to fool Peeves and it works, but he never says a word the readers can hear.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfTheDunCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfTheDunCow">The Book of the Dun Cow</a></em>, Ebenezer Rat never speaks, and is the only animal character who doesn't.

Despite this, she becomes a capable NCO under Lieutenant Kurt Ambrose when training Gamma Company. She also coordinates well with the other Spartans, who mostly communicate by hand gestures and comm beeps anyways. She can't do the Spartan version of the "all clear" signal (an "Olly olly oxen free" whistle), though.

<ul><li> Morn, an example of a "voiceless chatterbox". The funny part is that he wasn't originally meant to be a Voiceless character, and the make-up crew went through the trouble of making his mask in two parts (i.e., for a movable jaw) in anticipation of lines that never came. At first his lines ended up getting cut for time, and then the writers decided to turn it into a running joke. Played even further by having other characters constantly mention how much he keeps talking all the time and tells the funniest jokes... just never while the camera is around.
<ul><li> Just as Morn never speaks on screen, so the novels never give him dialogue (again, despite mentioning how he's actually a chatterbox). In the first book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekMillennium">Star Trek: Millennium</a></em>, it briefly looks like Morn has been giving dialogue.

</li></ul></li><li> Maihar'du, the Grand Nagus's servant, is said never to speak except to his master. The only time his voice is heard in the series, it's not actually him but a wormhole alien using his likeness.

He would never speak again.
<ul><li> Except in the novel <em>Imzadi</em>, where he speaks one more line. Riker reflects on how he'd only heard Homn speak once before.

</li><li> Bill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRedGreenShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRedGreenShow">The Red Green Show</a></em> is usually considered one of The Voiceless, though this may be unfair: he most often appears in the <em>Adventures With Bill</em> segments, in which the dialogue is replaced with a narration by Red, though he has shown up in the regular scenes from time to time, as well as in the <em>Red Green</em> movie <em>Duct Tape Forever</em>. In the "Behind The Scenes" special, the character of Bill appears, and points out that many people assume him to be mute, but he is actually quite talkative.
<ul><li> Justified in one of the books when Red states that the old black and white movie cameras they use to record the Adventure segments just have crappy microphones that don't pick up what Bill is saying.
<ul><li> In some of the adventures in seasons 7-8, and towards the end of the show when Rick Green returned, you can actually hear voiceovers of whatever Bill is saying at the time. He sounds like a frantic, hyperactive version of Rick Green, the man who plays him.
</li></ul></li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in one of the books, in which Bill is specifically handed a chance to ramble on... at length... about whatever he finds interesting... and we discover that it's probably just as well that we never actually hear him speak.
</li><li> Further, Bill is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> of Bill from Bala, a character from several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheFrantics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheFrantics">Frantics</a> skits. The main gag behind the character was that he never shut up. The joke here was he never got to talk.
</li></ul></li><li> The enigmatic racing driver known as The Stig on the British car show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> has only been seen to speak once in an interview, although he didn't say much else other than confirming that his name is The Stig. He is always wearing the same coveralls and helmet, which when added to his muteness suggest that more than one man (or tall flat-chested woman, or alien) may be playing the role.
<ul><li> There have been two Stigs on <em>Top Gear</em>: "The Black Stig" and "The White Stig I &amp; II" (named for the colors of the racing overalls and helmets that they wore). The Black Stig has been revealed to be British F1 driver Perry McCarthy, although McCarthy has stated that more than one driver has played the role of The Stig; while the identity of White Stig I is later revealed to be Ben Collins. To date, the identity of The White Stig II hasn't been revealed. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stig">The Other Wiki has an article on The Stig<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Incidentally, <em>Top Gear</em> has been far from hesitant to play around with The Stig's role as The Voiceless, as demonstrated in the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOxHV6QfJkg">DIY Caterham vs. The Stig<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> segment.

He is first heard speaking in a small boat in the middle of the ocean where the environmental conditions somehow prevent bugs from transmitting. He later abandoned this habit for no apparent reason.
</li><li> The episode "Battleground" of the mini-series <em>Nightmares and Dreamscapes</em> has no dialog whatsoever, including extras and an anchorwoman on television (the audience in aware of what's being reported by text instead). The main character does make some noise, such as yelling in pain, anger or surprise.

</li><li> The German sketch show "Klimbim" had the Silent Bar Guest. He did nothing than drink, fall from his stool and be a running gag. Until the end of one season, when he runs amok, guns everyone down and shouts "Now <em>I</em> am talking!"

</li><li> Mana from Malice Mizer and more recently Moi Dix Mois does this on purpose. During televised interviews he does not speak or emote, keeping a perfectly deadpan expression and opting to whisper his answers into a bandmate's ear so that they can answer for him, although he has been known to use mime and yes/no cards. According to him, this is because his music is his voice. So far he has kept it going for about 15 years with only two mistakes, not counting the time he sung through a distorter at a Malice Mizer live performance.

Not much of a problem, in that (since it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a>) he communicates mainly by kicking ass.
<ul><li> <em>Tekken 6</em>'s Scenrio Mode reveals that he is, in fact, capable of speech, he just chooses to not speak 99% of the time (a fact that is frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by several characters, especially Alisa).

(which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Blue</a> comments on in <em>Sun and Moon</em>). This is lampshaded in the first generation games and their remakes: the waiter on board the S.S. Anne refers to the player as "Le Strong Silent Type", but yet despite his lack of speech in future games and the above comment, in the games he is playable in he has several lines of internal thought, and a NPC even parrots his apparent dialogue at one point, which is revealed to be surprisingly fluent and casual.

</li><li> Link from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> is one example. Other than the random grunts and yells, he never utters any words:

However, Kiros and possibly Laguna have gotten REALLY good at reading his body language, to the point where they can interpret entire conversations with him.
<ul><li> Fujin is a variation.

Kimahri is set up as being one of these characters, being stoic and silent for the first few hours, but he surprises Tidus by speaking, and after that he has no problems opening up (though he's hardly a chatterbox). His earlier extended silence is explained as him not liking Tidus.

Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> shortly after your introduction to Alyx, where during an elevator ride she speaks of what's been going on while Gordon was away, and as the elevator comes to a stop she notes "man of few words, aren't you?"
<ul><li> Chell in sister series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> as well, but she is described as explicitly refusing to talk back to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/GLaDOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/GLaDOS">G La DOS</a> so as to prevent GLaDOS from goading her into doing something foolish.

S/He has exactly 4 lines in the game, each spoken during the final cutscene of a chapter. Subverted in the sequels, where s/he drops the mute act, and becomes a loudmouthed <strike>nut</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">puckish rogue</a>.
</li><li> Fuma Kotaro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Sengoku Basara</a></em> takes this to the extreme, making no noise at all: he doesn't even <em>breathe</em> audibly. This apparently comes from the fact that he's a highly professional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a> that just focuses on his job and has no need for words. The creators lampshade this, using a gust of wind and the sound of a shuriken as his voice sample, and having him communicate exclusively in ellipses.
</li><li> Samus Aran of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> used to be this. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em> only had a few lines outside of journal entries, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em> she talks constantly.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em>, this is played straight with Isaac. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking">can talk</a> in the sequel, though.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em>, Classic Sonic does not speak. Something of a nod to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Genesis</a> games, where Sonic never spoke. Classic Tails, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceForTheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceForTheVoiceless">on the other hand</a>...
</li><li> Ryuji from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle">No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle</a></em>. He never speaks during his cutscenes, and he only speaks in the battle when he does his dash or you lose a clash with him ("See you in hell...") or when he is summoning his dragon ("Come out, dragon..."). The rest is just grunts.
</li><li> Starfy from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendaryStarfy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendaryStarfy">Starfy</a></em> series, who only speaks in squeals.
</li><li> Isaku, the main antagonist and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTitle">title character</a> of the <em>Isaku</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> games and its anime adaptions, doesn't speak. He only communicates to the protagonist through notes narrated by someone else and videotapes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow">his deeds</a>.
</li><li> Isaac in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> game is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime">Heroic Mime</a>, and Felix takes over the role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a>: The Lost Age</em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em>, Isaac's son Matthew doesn't get any written lines, but it's implied that he speaks anyway; sometimes you'll be prompted to elucidate an emotional response to a remark, and if you choose "angry" in the right spot, Karis will remark, "Wow! Graphic!"
</li><li> Hawke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Advance Wars 2 and DS</a></em> partially qualifies. Where other Commanding Officers would cheer or lament at a good or bad turn of events for each simulated battle respectively, Hawke would only respond with "...", regardless of whether he suffered a crushing defeat or completely obliterated his opponent.
</li><li> Madotsuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/YumeNikki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/YumeNikki">Yume Nikki</a></em> only says "No" and "Impossible" in the entire game and only if you try to leave her apartment. Justified, as there isn't any dialogue to be shared in the first place. In the official manga, however, Madotsuki <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">does quite a lot of talking</a>.
</li><li> Enoch of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElShaddaiAscensionOfTheMetatron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElShaddaiAscensionOfTheMetatron">El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron</a></em> only says two sentences in the entire game, which are "No problem. Everything's fine.". He repeats those sentences whenever he recovers from a deadly attack, but he never says anything else, leaving most of the talking to Lucifel.
</li><li> Stavros "Bulldog" McGrogan, hero of <em>A Spot of Bother</em> and <em>The Warlord, the Princess and the Bulldog</em> communicates almost entirely through grunts and an occasional raised eyebrow. Practically the only time he speaks is to correct someone who tried to refer to him as "<em>Mister</em> Bulldog."
</li><li> The Tenno player characters from the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> have the capability to speak, but feel that actions speak better and instead communicate to each other using subtle gestures if any communication is needed. The only Tenno to speak so far is Valkyr, who upon using her "Warcry" ability emits a scream.
<ul><li> Now subverted as of <em>The Second Dream</em> where the true nature of the Tenno are revealed; Tenno do not "wear" their Warframes, they actually remotely control them via somatic link due to their human bodies being unable to safely project their powers without breaking down or becoming unstable. Once the Tenno is installed in the somatic chamber on the ship, they will become much more...vocal during missions, musing about certain factions and enemies and shouting encouragement to their warframes when downed in combat. The warframes themselves continue to play this trope straight, though it isn't clear whether they prefer to remain silent and let the Tenno do the talking, are physically unable of speaking, or simply aren't autonomous enough to have independent thought or speech.

After the prologue, which is the only part where she speaks in English, where she is set on fire, she received parasite therapy, where she uses her skin to breathe, but the side effect is that it renders her entirely mute capable of only a few subtle noises due to the parasites infecting her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> We later find she can speak other languages, particularly Navajo, she prefers not to speak in English because it would activate her vocal cord parasites.</span>

You can hear two guards talk about her telling workers to evacuate earlier in the level you fight her in, and can read a email by her later in the game.

This leads to others trying to interpret their lack of speech for their own purposes or just thinking that you're an asshole. The only time they do speak is at the very end of the first game, where they tell the main four boys <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">"Screw you guys, I'm going home"</a></span>.

<ul><li> Ada had only a single line as Nirvana, but it's not clear if it's just in Carl's mind who is capable of understanding her or if she did it out loud. This implies that her mother Ignis may be capable of speech too. But since both of them are trapped in doll bodies, this seems to be fairly difficult.
</li><li> Phantom doesn't speak until the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronophantasma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronophantasma">Chronophantasma</a>'s</em> story mode.

</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Most mobs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> make idle noises, which can tip the player off to the presence of nearby enemies. One thing that makes Creepers so dangerous (aside from the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">they explode</a>, of course) is that they <em>don't</em> have these, and the only noises they make are from being damaged or killed, or when they're just about to explode, at which point it's too late to evade them if you didn't already see them coming.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em>, cutscenes and dialogues are now fully voice acted as opposed to previous games where some of the dialogues are through text boxes. However some characters without a voice actor are either written out, or they don't speak at all in the scenes they are present, this includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules">Phil</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Prince Hans</a> and Dilan &amp; Aeleus.

She finally got a line in the late season 3 story "Prom: It's To Die For", although some fans were too busy reeling from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> to notice.
</li><li> The Watcher in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/KateModern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/KateModern">KateModern</a></em>, who appears frequently but never gets a line. Mostly, he just... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWatcher">watches</a>. Silently.
</li><li> The German radio drama <em>Allimania</em> (which is set in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>) has the character Raoul. Everytime he speaks, the sound of a train is played and all character laugh about how funny he is... except for the female elf priestess, who does not believe that Raoul is NOT the Voiceless, despite what the other characters tell her.

</li><li> Menelaos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreekNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreekNinja">Greek Ninja</a></em> a lot of the time due to his limited knowledge of English.
</li><li> Mime and Mole of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HappyTreeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HappyTreeFriends">Happy Tree Friends</a></em> are the only ones who don't speak due to Mime being a mime although he can sometimes be heard to scream in pain as he's being killed and Mole being blind and deaf.

What was meant to be a one-off gag was so popular with the fans that three years later, Précieux's player has yet to get a new microphone.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Jayuzumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Jayuzumi">Jayuzumi</a> is a variation. He is capable of speech in real life, but having him talk personally would ruin the whole soundboard joke, so he instead plays voice clips from various works to bypass this.

She loses her voice extremely easily, so in order to conserve her voice, she never speaks. Instead, she writes on a tablet and uses sign language to communicate, only using her voice to sing.

</li><li> Just like in the newspaper comics, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VanBeurenStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VanBeurenStudios">Van Beuren Studios</a> cartoon adaptation of The Little King has no dialogue. Even when he does "speak" in "Jest of Honor", it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">completely unintelligible gibberish.</a>
<ul><li> Their Tom &amp; Jerry act like this in most of their shorts, with the notable exception of "Plane Dumb".
</li><li> Molly Moo Cow usually doesn't speak in her shorts either; she either makes cow like moos and grunts, or facsimiles of words like "Yoo Hoo!". She does have a few lines of dialogue in "Molly Moo Cow Meets Rip Van Winkle".
</li></ul></li><li> Grown-up Maggie, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "Lisa's Wedding". Every time she is about to speak she is interrupted. (And just to rub it in, Dr. Hibbert comments, "Heh heh, she's quite a hellion but she does have an incredible voice." And in another scene, Homer mutters to himself "Doesn't that girl ever shut up?") In fact, the only words Maggie has said at all (barring "Treehouse of Horror" shorts, hallucinations, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>) is "Daddy" (and, during the credits in the movie, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel</a>?"</span>, as well as the 20th season finale, where she repeatedly says "Ya" after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyJewish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyJewish">the ambiguously Norwegian</a> Ogdenvillians migrate to Springfield).
<ul><li> In another episode set in the future, "Holidays of Future Past", Maggie is now a famous rock star, but is instructed not to speak while pregnant, as it turns out that "the umbilical cord is also a vocal cord".
</li><li> In a brief flashback in the episode "Friends and Family", Maggie is shown to be capable of speaking in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyTalk">Baby Talk</a>.

</li><li> The Blue Spirit from the episode of the same name appears to be this at first, communicating with Aang only by motioning with one of his swords. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is because he turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Zuko</a> and speaking would have given away his identity. Later in the series, he speaks minimally as his Blue Spirit persona when dealing with characters who would not recognize his voice.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of the Canadian cartoon <em>Kevin Spencer</em> does speak, and the other characters react appropriately, although the audience almost never hears his voice. Instead, the show's narrator tells us what Kevin is "saying".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> episode "The Incredible Mr. Brisby", the title character has an imposing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">black</a> henchman who makes evil faces while carrying out his commands, but never speaks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Until the end, where in his final confrontation, he shrugs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">"Man, I don't even need this job," and stalks off</a>.</span>
</li><li> The title character in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkPanther">Pink Panther</a></em> cartoon almost never spoke in the original shorts. In fact, there were only two cartoons in which he actually spoke ("Sink Pink" and "Pink Ice" with the voice of Rich Little). When he got his own spinoff series in the 1990's, he spoke in nearly every episode (voice of Matt Frewer).
</li><li> The title characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> rarely speak beyond screams and yelps of pain. In some shorts they have at least one line of dialogue, and the only short in which both of them spoke throughout the picture was <em>The Lonesome Mouse</em>. Strangely enough, when the two hear each other talk in <em>Tom and Jerry The Movie</em>, they act very surprised despite having heard each other talk in past cartoons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>, Dil can't talk. He can hardly say any words.
</li><li> Pulgita from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuchaLucha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuchaLucha">¡Mucha Lucha!</a>''. She can only speak her brother's name and in later episodes and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> she can't talk at all.
</li><li> Snoopy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> doesn't really talk in the cartoons, but he does laugh, cry, and say words like "hey!", "ow!", and "woah!" On a few occasions in the specials (and regularly in the newspaper strip) we hear him "speak" through his thoughts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily">The Proud Family</a></em>, Nubia is the only member of the Gross sisters who talks while the other two don't even make a single sound in the whole series.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClerksTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClerksTheAnimatedSeries">Clerks: The Animated Series</a></em> segments at the end of the episodes, starring the above Jay and Silent Bob, the trope is inverted: instead of referring to the Voiceless as someone who talks a lot, he refers to Silent Bob's supposed inability to talk. The twist is that during these segments, Bob talks <em>completely normally</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jay:</strong> Kids, if Silent Bob could talk, he'd remind you that when you're camping, it's always smart to tie your food up in a tree at night so as not to attract bears. <br/><strong>Silent Bob:</strong> Word.a
</div></li><li> Furball from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> usually only spoke through meows, but there were two episodes in which he talked. In "Buster and the Wolverine", after Sweetie is eaten by the wolverine, he comments on how he wanted to be the one to eat her. And in a <em>Star Trek</em> parody, he played the role of McCoy.
</li><li> Although that isn't the case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>, in the working pilot for the series titled <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgiNbuFwORw">Garage Kids<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, Ulrich is The Voiceless. He says a total of two syllables — blink and you'll miss it.
<ul><li> XANA qualifies on the actual <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>. He only communicates with the heroes in two episodes, both times when he disguises himself as someone else; first as Jérémie and later as Franz Hopper.

<ul><li> Then who is that singing his (first-person) theme song?
</li></ul></li><li> Hisomi, of the Ninja Tribunal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em>, is one of these, due to his role as the Ninja Master of Stealth.
<ul><li> The Foot Elite Guard, almost. They <em>rarely</em> talk, but one of them did so in the episode where Karai debuted.
</li></ul></li><li> Jericho, a last-minute inductee of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> cartoon, has no voice of his own. His power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">possession</a> allows him to use the voice of whomever he chooses to overshadow.
<ul><li> Ironically, this exception to the trope backfires when Jericho. infiltrating a villainous stronghold, uses a borrowed body to respond to another Mook's question. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out that the borrowed body's owner, Cinderblock, is <em>also</em> The Voiceless. "Since when can you talk?"</span>

He does use hand gestures and motions with his wiffle bat he carries everywhere but he has audibly coughed and sneezed at some points. Apparently, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a>.

</li><li> Hammerhead's chauffeur also never vocalizes at all otuside of a pained scream in "The Uncertainty Principle".
</li></ul></li><li> For all intents and purposes, Brainy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> never ever says anything, just... snores.

It's never made clear whether she <em>can't</em> speak or just chooses not to. (She does cry out in pain a couple of times if she's hit hard enough in a fight.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em>, both the Joker and the Penguin have a pair of henchmen who never speak.
<ul><li> The Joker has Punch and Judy, two hulking musclemen dressed like clowns. (In fact, when Clayface disguises himself as one of them and <em>does</em> speak, the Joker quickly smells a rat.)
</li><li> The Penguin has the Kabuki Twins, two female assassins. (Given their blind loyalty to him and how no bare flesh is ever seen on either of them, some have speculated that they may be robots, or even mutated birds that he created using his mastery of orinthology.)
</li></ul></li><li> Debbie Grund, Buck Strickland's secretary and mistress from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> was silent until the episode "Hanky Panky" she is also killed off in that same episode.
<ul><li> The firefighter "Beef" from "A Firefighting We Will Go" never says a single word onscreen and uses hand gestures to communicate. However, he laughs plenty throughout the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> The Chameleon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em> is an odd case — he never once uses his <em>own voice</em>, instead imitating other people.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AngelinaBallerina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AngelinaBallerina">Angelina Ballerina</a>: The Next Steps</em>, Ms. Mimi appears this because of having laryngitis. She spends the whole episode communicating with Angelina and her friends by notes and music. Luckily, she got her voice back in the end.
</li><li> Toki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em>. According to one episode, they took a vow of silence.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em>, one of the Air Pirates never spoke out loud, only whispering into Don Karnage's ear. The pirate's name, ironically, was Gibber.
</li><li> Ricardo, Jasper's boyfriend in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> only appeared twice in the series and in both episodes, he never speaks. This is handwaved by Japser, saying that "Ricardo doesn't speak any English." Actually, he DOES speak in a deleted scene from "You May Now Kiss the, Uh, Guy Who Receives".
<ul><li> Susie Swanson doesn't talk since she is a baby and is not Stewie, but she has an inner voice that channels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart">Patrick Stewart</a>.

<ul><li> Wile E. Coyote was mainly silent throughout the series, except for the two-reeler <em>The Adventures of the Road Runner</em> (a 1962 proposed pilot for a Road Runner TV show) where he answers a child's question on why he wants to catch the Road Runner and then using film to examine his shortcomings.
</li><li> He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking">spoke</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> in four cartoons where he is paired against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a>.

He vainly tries to communicate this through pantomime to his annoyed, incredulous master.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>, after the trauma of being mutated (probably painfully) into a cat-bat-fish thing by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">Evilutionary Biologist</a>, one poor man never speaks again. Nobody even knows his name, so they call him "Claw." All the others who were mutated in the same way still have the anatomy for human speech, so it's clear Claw was just psychologically damaged. This occasionally leads to charades/pantomime when he wants to express something.
</li><li> Leonardo, the pint-sized assistant to Clyde Crashcup on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAlvinShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAlvinShow">The Alvin Show</a>,</em> never spoke out loud. He usually just whispered to Clyde.

<ul><li> Though all four princesses are in attendance in this episode, Celestia and Luna don't speak, save for gasping when seeing the icy cloud, and saying, "You guess?!?!" with the Mane 6 and Cadance. (Although if one listens carefully, it sounds like Nicole Oliver and Tabitha St. Germain, Celestia's and Luna's voice actors respectively, never recorded those two words for them during production.)

However, we could be dealing with a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpeechless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpeechless">The Speechless</a>: in the novelization of the second EQG, she's the one to suggest the idea of starting a band to Rainbow Dash via text message while <em>right beside</em> her and with no visible reason to avoid speaking. How much canon weight the book has for you may vary, but the idea that she really can't speak is no longer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> territory.
</li><li> Twist was silent in the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E19CrusadersOfTheLostMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E19CrusadersOfTheLostMark">Crusaders of the Lost Mark</a>", because her voice actress had moved away from Vancouver since the last time the character spoke.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> episode "Where No Fan Has Gone Before", which features the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, depicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeForestKelley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeForestKelley">DeForest Kelley</a> this way since he'd already passed away in 1999.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a>,</em> Onion never speaks to anyone but his parents, and <em>then</em> he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">The Unintelligible</a>. Most of his communication is via nodding or shaking is head. It's the <em>least</em> of what's strange about him, and this show being this show, there proving to be a reason behind it all that's no laughing matter someday is a <em>very</em> real possibility.
</li><li> Shapey and Block in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em> both come pretty close to this trope: what little communication they do is unintelligible screeching and the occasional screeched word (usually 'cake', 'no', or 'mine'). Keep in mind we know Shapey is <em>seven</em>, and Block is implied to be the same age, for all they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">act like three year olds</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shapey finally says a complete sentence in a normal tone of voice in the episode "Sacrifice".</span>
<div class="indent"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "When I'm thirsty, it feels like I feel when I'm alone."</span>
</div></li><li> Officer Tattles from <em>Capertown Cops</em>. The only noises he makes are sound effects, usually a horn being honked.
</li><li> All Characters on <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CrystalTippsAndAlistair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CrystalTippsAndAlistair">Crystal Tipps And Alistair</a></em> does not even speak.
</li><li> Jet on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Astroblast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Astroblast">Astroblast</a></em> doesn't even Talk and He's Silent.
</li><li> "Marisa And The Mirror" and "Feeling Clammy" , two of the Secret Life Of Sirenas shorts from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElenaOfAvalor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElenaOfAvalor">Elena of Avalor</a></em> , respectively do this to Marisa and Daria. In the former, she comes across a mirror , with all of her emotions being expressed through facial expressions , and no dialogue, even when warning Elena of a shark. In the latter, she and Elena are trying to figure out how to save Ocho from a giant clam. She has no dialogue, outside of some grunts, with Elena getting more of the dialogue. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2s2ne');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2s2ne" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2s2ne');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It was probably hard to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GinaRodriguez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GinaRodriguez">Gina Rodriguez</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosarioDawson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosarioDawson">Rosario Dawson</a> for what would essentially be a few lines. The grunts are most likely stock audio. </span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries">Tangled: The Series</a></em> episode "Lost And Found" foreshadows Cassandra <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> pulling a face heel turn</span> , which eventually comes true in the next episode, yet she doesn't say a single word.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em> features examples of this, most notably with Ariel in the metaphorical sense of this trope and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRescuersDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRescuersDownUnder">Percival C. McLeach</a></em> and Mr. Snoops in the literal sense of this trope.

<ul><li> Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas is just as talkative as anybody when not on the bench. When he is ON the bench on the other hand he can go years without talking. Thomas has become more talkative since Antonin Scalia's death, though.
</li><li> One author who presents himself this way is ItsJustSomeRandomGuy<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxBoCiB5qHI">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who does the "I'm a Marvel/And I'm a DC" shorts on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>.
</li><li> Lucius Sergius Catilina (or "Catiline"), the guy who almost destroyed the Roman republic in 64 BC doesn't have dialogue in ANY historical writings. His speeches are mentioned and he is occasionally quoted, but nobody has any idea what his own voice sounds like. All we've got are people talking about him, such as Sallust and Cicero.
</li><li> Dane Cook mentioned this trope (and the "speaking for one dramatic moment") in one of his jokes about action movies. He says that every team in an action movie has the one guy who "never says anything, he just stands there. And he never talks, ever, except for like, <em>one</em> scene near the end where he says 'Let's go kill those bitches.'"
</li><li> Moonie, in one version of his performance, (usually) will not speak, and instead use gestures, sounds, and the like to convey ideas. Then, towards the end of his act, after having found an audience member who can follow directions; then conveyed the idea that he will be juggling torches on a tightrope, and, if he catches fire, the volunteer should use a bucket of water on him, utters his first line: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Don't. Screw. Up."</span>
</li><li> The guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. They are only allowed to speak during the Changing of the Guard...unless someone <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsdHxUXf2CE">is acting disrespectful.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This is just when they are on guard duty. The rest of the time they can do anything that anyone else in the Army can.
