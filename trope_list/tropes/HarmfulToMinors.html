The head landed at his feet and <em>tried to speak</em>. It didn't get much better for him afterwards. During his quest for revenge, Afro ends up killing a man in front of his adopted son in a manner similar to how his father was killed in front of him. After getting the Number One Headband, Afro hands the Number Two headband to the boy with a quiet "Anytime you're ready."
<p></p></li><li> As a child, Yuri of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em> witnessed her three younger siblings' murder at the hands of a gang of robbers. This is the root of her anger towards God. It was also her "fault" that they died because she couldn't find money in the house to give to the robbers. They probably would've killed them all regardless, but that doesn't really help Yuri's feelings of guilt.
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> does not shy away from this at all. Children are shown witnessing all manner of violence, especially when Titans attack populated areas.
<ul><li> Eren Yeager and his adopted sister, Mikasa, saw their mother get devoured by a Titan when they were ten.
</li><li> Mikasa was adopted into the Yeager family at the age of nine, after witnessing the brutal murder of her parents. She was kidnapped by the killers, and forced to help Eren kill them to survive.
</li><li> Krista witnessed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her mother's throat being slit</span> when she was a child.
</li><li> Reiner and Bertolt barely survived a Titan attack when they were 12 and 11, respectively. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They, along with Annie, are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenForcedToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenForcedToKill">Children Forced to Kill</a> that caused the loss of Wall Maria</span>.

In the anime he is 12, whereas in the original manga he is 6.

<ul><li> Ciel Phantomhive was such a happy child until his 10th birthday when his parents, house staff, and DOG were murdered, and his house was burned to the ground. He was then captured by some insane cultists. From what's been implied he was beaten and treated as a slave while being kept in a cage with other children around his age. He had to watch other children be sacrificed... and knew he'd eventually be next. No wonder he's a cynical, bitter child now.
</li><li> Alois Trancy in the second season of the non-canon anime. When he was real young, his foster family died in front of him, from unknown supernatural means, including his adoptive brother and only friend, and its heavily implied he was raped and beaten as well.

Lets just say that their past is so horrific that they managed to be the most fucked up twisted characters in the series but also make you feel sorry for them. The other characters whose childhoods ae known might be better, but only marginally so:
<ul><li> Revy and Fabiola were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">Street Urchins</a> in the slums of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigRottenApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigRottenApple">New York</a> and Caracas respectively, and Revy were the bane of the Juvenile unit and later the precinct she lived in, until kicked off to Thailand with the not so much hidden threat to saddle her with every case thay have in stock had she get caught again.
</li><li> Garcia got involved into the whole bisuness with the CIA about his father, and only survived because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">psychotic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">killer maid</a> with whom he is in a genuine, but definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">quite unhealthy relationship</a>.
</li><li> Even Balalaika had to deal with the loss of the family honor due to the powergames of the Soviet elite.
</li><li> The least disturbed of all is probably Rock, who simply was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>, as his parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">heaped all their love and attention</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">his brother</a>.

<ul><li> When Ichigo was a child, his mother got killed and eaten by a Hollow in front of him.
</li><li> Ishida saw his grandfather get killed and eaten by Hollows, with the shinigami nowhere in sight, when he was a child.
</li><li> When Orihime was a baby, her abusive parents would beat her if she made a fuss. Orihime's older brother (who was fifteen at the time) would hide her away and protect her from the beatings.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em> has a pair of twins who initially had a happy childhood with a woman who they thought was their mother (she was a spurned lover of their actual father and had kidnapped them as revenge). One day, she died suddenly, and because of the kidnapping, she had made it so that the doors were locked from the inside. So, the children were trapped inside of an apartment with her corpse for several weeks, as their food supply gradually dwindled to nothing. During this time, they were constantly screaming and banging on the walls to be rescued, but their neighbors just shouted back for them to shut up. It's not too surprising that they were left thinking that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turned evil</a>.
<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, Satella and her butler are the only survivors of a demon attack that killed her family. Her older sister's badly injured body was carried off by the demon and may or may not be still alive  she's dedicated her life to avenging her family by being a demon-hunter-for-hire, while searching for the demon responsible for the attacks and the fate of her sister.
<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Nunnally and Lelouch see their mother gunned down in front of them. Nunnally is left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">crippled from injuries</a> and blind from emotional trauma. For Lelouch, finding out who was responsible for the assassination and getting revenge on them is a major motivation. His father, Emperor Charles, also watched a carriage get dropped on their mother with his brother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">V.V.</span>.
<p></p></li><li> Most of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">L's successors</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> would probably fit this trope, as they are all orphans who may have witnessed the deaths of their families, and are ruthlessly groomed from a young age to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">succeed L</span>, with seemingly little regard to their mental health.
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> The murders are always drawn realistically, and it becomes pretty shocking when the victim was once a happy-go-lucky guy, now seen with blood covering his face, having shown to have struggled to survive, and his eyes wide-open from the surprise.
</li><li> There's an episode where Ayumi hides in the trunk of a car, ends up being "kidnapped" and finds the decapitated head of a young girl who is assumed to have been killed by two serial killers who kill young girls. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But it was just props for a play.</span>
</li><li> While averted with Conan and Haibara, The Detective Kids and Ran Mouri manage to scream and look at murder in pure shock despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyOfTheWeek">Body of the Week</a> premise.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DogsBulletsAndCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DogsBulletsAndCarnage">Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Naoto was a child, she and her parents were attacked by someone with a sword. Her parents put her behind them to protect her from the killer, who in two strokes, quartered them and left Naoto with amnesia and a huge X-shaped scar on her chest. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later, she finds out that the people she remembered as being her parents in fact weren't at all, but simply two scientists that betrayed a facility that performed ruthless, and often deadly experiments on children.</span>
</li><li> Heine, Giovanni, Lilly (and other children) were experimented on and were forced to kill or be killed to test their new abilities. They watched fellow children get ripped apart by monsters until they realized they could fight back and tore apart the monsters (and sometimes, by accident, each other) with their bare hands.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Upa witnesses Mercenary Tao murdering his father, and apparently shooting Goku through the heart.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Son Gohan is kidnapped by his long-lost uncle at the age of four, beaten about, forced to watch his father die, kidnapped again by the devil, beaten about some more and left to look after himself in the wilderness for six months. And this is all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">in the first 5 episodes</a>. No wonder the original dub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">bumped his age up to 5 and a half.</a>
</li><li> Also in <em>Z</em>, Son Goten had to watch his mother get murdered by Super Buu.

The Fourth Kazekage, Gaara's father and the leader of the village of Sunagakure, intended to use Gaara as the village's personal weapon. Gaara was trained by his father throughout his childhood to help gain control over the abilities granted to him by Shukaku. Despite this, Gaara was ostracized by the Sunagakure villagers, who viewed him as a monster for being the host of a tailed beast. Gaara would occasionally snap from the villagers' stares and harm/kill them. These attacks on the villagers convinced Gaara's father that he was a failed experiment, and he ordered Gaara's assassination. All of the attempts on Gaara's life failed, as Shukaku would always protect Gaara from harm and kill the assassin. Realizing that he had been abandoned by his family, Gaara adopted the belief that he could only rely upon himself and Shukaku, and that he had to kill others in order to confirm the value of his own existence.
</li><li> Haku's childhood. Haku's father and mother were simple farmers, and they lived a peaceful life. They loved each other, and were kind to their child. Unfortunately, this all changed one day. Haku's mother was a carrier of a kekkei genkai: Ice Release. She hid this fact from her husband, hoping that the love and peace that was shared in their small family would last forever. One day, Haku discovered the ability to manipulate water. Amazed by this, Haku proudly showed this to his mother, who was horrified by what she saw, and harshly scolded Haku for displaying his ability. Unbeknownst to his mother, Haku's father had seen everything. When Haku's father discovered that his wife and child possessed a kekkei genkai, he assembled a small mob of villagers, and killed his wife. He would have done the same to Haku, but before he could, Haku killed them. Orphaned, Haku became a child who was wanted by no-one and was forced to take to the cold streets and rummage through trash bins for scraps of food, even sometimes having to fight off the wild dogs that roamed the streets. In time, he was found by Zabuza Momochi, who asked Haku to become his "weapon," which meant to become a dedicated kekkei genkai shinobi for Zabuza. Haku readily accepted this role, due to the purpose it gave him, devoting his life to becoming Zabuza's ultimate weapon.

The Arklight siblings are verbally and mentally abused by their father, Tron, so that they will help him carry out his revenge which includes torturing a young child in front of his big brother before stealing his powers and nearly killing him, and attempting to kill another duelist's sister in a fire. The numbers duelist's working for Dr. Faker and Mr.Heartland were recruited as young children and put through brutal, almost fatal, dueling exercises to train them to steal peoples souls.

Originally, the seven were young kids who had short, brutal lives before they died filled with rage. Their reincarnations are convince to reprise their original forms to help their world; by destroying earth. The main characters, who, again, are all young kids, are forced to watch the destruction of their home and the deaths of thousands of innocents, before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">each of them are forced into death duels or outright killed as sacrifices.</span> The seven Barians realize their mistakes, but are all <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killed as well</span>.

</li><li> The Russian short film <em>Lyuba</em> is a deeply uncomfortable look at child abuse in which a little girl runs away from her abusive mother and hides out in the woods, where she reenacts her abuse with her dolls, at which point it becomes clear that she's also been sexually abused as well.

Understandably, this causes him to have a fear of Santa Claus. At the age of ten, he saw two orphanage workers having sex; the extremely strict Mother Superior told him all sex was evil. Naturally, he believed her. Then one fateful night at the age of 18 he witnesses one of his coworkers (who happens to be dressed as Santa) raping one of the female workers. It all proves too much, causing him to finally snap and go on a killing spree killing everyone he believed to be <em>naughty</em>.

Her mother had mistreated her and then left her with her father, and she had to have known what the man intended to do to his own daughter. The abuse continued until she was eight years old when she managed to stab her father to death while he was trying to rape her again. She also had to face more problems after that. Roarke was beaten up by his father and his non-biological mother left him because she cared nothing for him. Nixie Swisher from <em>Survivor in Death</em> witnessed murder when her family was slaughtered in one night. It shouldn't hurt to be a kid!

Felix's beat him severely leaving him with massive scarring on his back and nearly drowned him several times, started on him sexually at eight, and after the Keeper's death in a massive fire (that killed the few friends the boy had) he ended up in a brothel that catered to BDSM.

For twenty years, preschoolers have been molested and exploited for child pornography. Regarding the violence, it is not against the kids themselves or other humans, but animals. To terrorize the kids into silence, the staff at Treehouse kill live rabbits — which they previously assigned to the kids to care for as an incentive to cooperate with the molestation — right in front of the kids.

It leads him to a life of abstinence because he believes that if he does the "sweating, grunting thing" he will be no better than Uncle. He escapes by administering "justice" (a clean knife-stroke to the heart)... when he is 9 years old.

She herself has been threatened with rape. In Harrenhal she sees several women put in stocks getting raped as a form of punishment. She was beaten bloody and caned until blood ran down her thighs more than once. Arya also saw multiple people get murdered and has forced herself to grow numb to death and violence on her journey. She's not even 12 yet.
<ul><li> Her sister Sansa hasn't had it any better. She had to endure the violent attentions of her fiance Joffrey, watching people get killed while enduring her share of physical abuse and humiliation as well. She was threatened with rape several times and almost raped twice, half stripped and beaten in the audience of court. She was also forced on her bed to sing for a drunk man who at the time was holding a knife to her throat. These Stark girls have seen too much.
