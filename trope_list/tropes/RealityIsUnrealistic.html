</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAggressiveDrugDealer">The Aggressive Drug Dealer</a>: <em>Actual</em> drug dealers don't come up to random kids or teens (or adults for that matter) and pressure them into trying and getting hooked on drugs, or slip them drugs in the guise of "candy." Most people who use drugs get their first dose from a friend or family member, or even their own doctor. If they then want more or become addicted (and they don't <em>always</em>), <em>they</em> seek out a dealer, often by asking a friend who "knows someone." It certainly has happened that someone randomly tries to sell a strangers drugs (particularly in certain locations), but generally if the other party is uninterested they'll leave quickly, as pressuring random people (especially minors) into trying drugs is a <em>great</em> way to wind up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prison">Prison</a>, and most dealers take great pains to stay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathNotice">Beneath Notice</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDesertsHaveCacti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDesertsHaveCacti">All Deserts Have Cacti</a>: Cacti are present in fictional deserts anywhere in the world, even though in reality they're endemic to the Americas barring one species (which is not the stereotypical saguaro).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllFlyersAreBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllFlyersAreBirds">All Flyers Are Birds</a>: Birds are the only avian ones, even though there's also bats, for example. Thus creatures that fly must be inherently bird-like.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronisticAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronisticAnimal">Anachronistic Animal</a>: Animals from different time periods are shown living together. Particularly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></em> is often depicted hunting <em>Brontosaurus</em> and <em>Stegosaurus</em>, both of which died out millions of years before <em>T. rex</em> in real life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsSeeInMonochrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsSeeInMonochrome">Animals See in Monochrome</a>: Few animals have completely monochrome vision.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudibleSharpness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudibleSharpness">Audible Sharpness</a>: Real swords only go <em>shing!</em> when they're touching something metallic.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BangBangBANG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BangBangBANG">Bang, Bang, BANG</a>: Even handguns are expected to sound like huge explosions rather than firecrackers in real life.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneficialDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneficialDisease">Beneficial Disease</a>: Once you've had Tropeosis, you can't get it again, and if you currently have it, you can't get Tropeitis.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0u67l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0u67l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0u67l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There are some diseases which can behave somewhat like this, as the process of fighting off an infection results in a large number of antibodies attuned to the chemical signature of that particular disease strain. This means that later infections of the same strain are often destroyed before they can gain a foothold in the body. However, this applies to only a handful of diseases - mostly certain families of viruses - which mutate particularly slowly or have some specific structural component that the antibodies can consistently attach themselves to. The only reason it is a common trope is because many of the previously common diseases such as polio, measles, smallpox, and chicken pox, tend to be like this, though even then mutations can occur that negate this conferred immunity. Also, even with these diseases a re-infection <em>during</em> the initial infection can make it far more serious, depending on the initial health of the patient. Finally, secondary infections are a <em>very</em> serious risk, and with many diseases - including AIDS (which isn't generally fatal on its own) and Alzheimer's Disorder (which isn't thought to be an infectious disease at all) - are the main cause of death. </span>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitterAlmonds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitterAlmonds">Bitter Almonds</a>: Not everyone has the (genetic) ability to detect the almond smell that is associated with cyanide, and even those who can smell it may not know what it means.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">Blown Across the Room</a>: Getting hit with a (non-explosive) bullet will send you crashing through the nearest window, even though a bullet (or a laser blast) doesn't have the mass or momentum to propel you there (the force acting on the bullet is exactly equal to the force acting on the gun, meaning the bullet won't knock you down any more than the recoil will knock the shooter down).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">Boom, Headshot!</a>: No one ever goes for the safer, more sensible shot at the center of mass.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">Burn the Witch!</a>: People accused of being witches are invariably shown being burned at the stake. In real life, burning witches at the stake was only done in Continental Europe. This is because burning at the stake was the prescribed punishment for heresy (well before the witchcraft hysteria, it was also used on the Cathars). In Britain, most witches were hanged instead. The reason for this is that witches in Britain were being accused of treason rather than heresy, because heresy was not actually a crime in Britain. However, since the King was God's representative on earth, conspiring with the devil was also conspiracy against the King. Or so the witch-hunter logic went. There would certainly be no reason for a future or fictional society to burn witches.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingCard">Calling Cards</a> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalMindGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalMindGames">Criminal Mind Games</a>: While not <em>completely</em> unheard of in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, they are <em>nowhere near</em> as prevalent as they are in fiction. That's because most criminals are trying <em>not</em> to get caught, and leaving a consistent pattern or signature makes catching them easier.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonBomb">Cartoon Bomb</a>: It actually is a realistic representation of 19th century explosive artillery ammunition.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonCheese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonCheese">Cartoon Cheese</a>: In cartoons, cheese will resemble Swiss cheese colored like cheddar. In reality, they come in a much wider variety.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonMeat">Cartoon Meat</a>: Meats in cartoons tend to look different than in real life. For example, steaks will be shown as red even when they're supposed to be cooked, and whole roasted birds will often be missing their wings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleanPrettyChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleanPrettyChildbirth">Clean, Pretty Childbirth</a>: Actual childbirth is <em>much</em> messier than most TV and movies would have you believe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">The Coconut Effect</a>: The fictional version of an element is so ingrained in perception that it <em>has</em> to be used to represent that element, even when everyone knows it's fiction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolClearWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolClearWater">Cool, Clear Water</a>: Water in fiction is almost always presented as clean, pure, and potable right from the pond/spring/lake/river/whatever. In actuality, drinking water <em>directly</em> from a stream without treating it first is <em>highly</em> inadvisable, because it may be contaminated with harmful bacteria and parasites, or even toxic chemicals.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonFanFallacies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonFanFallacies">Common Fan Fallacies</a>: Fans think something in a work of fiction is inaccurate but is actually true.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonHollywoodSexTraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonHollywoodSexTraits">Common Hollywood Sex Traits</a>: Leads to many misconceptions about how sex actually is or should be like. Real sex isn't always sexy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummationCounterfeit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummationCounterfeit">Consummation Counterfeit</a>: The hymen can be broken in ways <em>completely unrelated</em> to sex, and it doesn't always break the first time a woman has penetrative sex. The vast majority of women <em>do not</em> bleed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime">Their First Time</a>. There is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginityFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginityFlag">reliable way to tell a virgin from a non-virgin</a>. With that in mind, sometimes trickery of this sort was necessary whether the bride was a virgin or not, because the families wanted to see what they thought was proof that she was a virgin. (Some places still do this.) The misconception of a woman's first sex necessarily being a bloody and painful event is found in many works. <br/><br/>Similarly, the idea of virgins feeling "tight." That is a function of the pelvic floor muscles, and it really has nothing to do with virginity: a common reaction to nervousness (such as that resulting from sex with a new partner, or a new experience) is to reflexively clench those pelvic floor muscles. That also does not just happen to virgins, either, and those muscles do not become weaker or "looser" with the amount of sex (or number of sexual partners) their owner has. Also, medically speaking, if nothing is prolapsing ("falling out"), and bladder and bowels are under voluntary control, then there's nothing wrong with her pelvic floor. This is why the "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/husband-stitch-is-not-just-myth">husband stitch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" (which is quite real) is harmful and can cause intense pain and injury.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCamelSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCamelSpider">Creepy Camel Spider</a>: Fictionalized depictions of solifugids tend to portray them as hyperaggressive desert terrors, and often assign them traits — such as venom, the ability to scream, or a willingness to attack anything much larger than a mouse — that they plainly don't have in real life..
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCSIEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCSIEffect">The CSI Effect</a>: The fictionalized depiction of crime scene investigation has given the general public unrealistic expectations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> crime scene investigation. (It has also created more savvy criminals.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">Dawson Casting</a>: Using adult actors to play teenagers has given people unrealistic ideas about what young adults really look like, leading to accusations that a certain actor is "too young" to play an adult when in fact they are in their late 20s or early 30s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfAWhiteChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfAWhiteChristmas">Dreaming of a White Christmas</a>: Winter holidays are always snowy, and said snow is always fluffy and white, never miserable or wet or slushy. It is also largely cosmetic instead of a potentially life-threatening hazard (unless the story demands it).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis">Eagleland Osmosis</a>: When non-Americans expect things in their country to work like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">America</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndangeredSouffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndangeredSouffle">Endangered Soufflé</a>: Soufflés are so sensitive that even the slightest shock can cause one to collapse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhanceButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhanceButton">Enhance Button</a>: Fictional computer programs can accurately sharpen pictures or video that started at very low resolution. However, AI Research <a class="urllink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/21/can-a-dreaming-ai-fix-low-res-digital-photos-in-the-edit/amp/">is slowly making this possible<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, although still not remotely at the level in fiction, and it works best for enhancing art. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/future-perfect/2019/9/4/20848008/ai-machine-learning-enhance-button">Research not yet for public use<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> actually has hit enhance button levels.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimosArentReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimosArentReal">Eskimos Aren't Real</a>: As in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>, but here the disbelieved thing is common, not bizarre or kitschy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">Evolutionary Levels</a>: The idea that evolutionary history has tiers of "advancement" when it's really just millions of years of trial-and-error. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, this led to an incredibly prejudiced classification of the human races along the evolutionary spectrum.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveDecompression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveDecompression">Explosive Decompression</a>: People don't actually explode in the vacuum of space.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">Fair for Its Day</a>: Societies of former times also uphold values that modern audiences might see as too progressive for the era.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlushingToiletScreamingShower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlushingToiletScreamingShower">Flushing Toilet, Screaming Shower</a>: In fiction, flushing the toilet while someone is showering always results in a pressure change and hilarity ensuing. Because it's not like pressure-balanced shower valves nowadays are specifically designed to prevent this from happening.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakierThanFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakierThanFiction">Freakier Than Fiction</a>: When adapting a true story, the story has to be toned down because the audience wouldn't believe it otherwise.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale">Fille Fatale</a>: A young girl (or, for that matter, a young boy) acting in a sexually precocious manner <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior">troubling</a>, but not for the reason most people think. It's often a sign that somewhere along the line she (or he) was sexually abused. (As people have begun to get more of a clue about the prevalence of child/teen molestation, they're more likely to remember this.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveStagesOfGrief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveStagesOfGrief">Five Stages of Grief</a>: Following Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' clean pretty timeline, grief follows a set timetable, with very specific stages. In reality, not everyone goes through every stage, nor does grief follow a neat and well-defined timeline. Additionally, grief can come in unpredictable waves or cycles; the grieving person may feel fine one day, and then the next day, they may feel sad or angry again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiantSauropod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiantSauropod">Gentle Giant Sauropod</a>: Sauropods may or may not have been as friendly as they are usually depicted in media.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoofyFeatheredDinosaur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoofyFeatheredDinosaur">Goofy Feathered Dinosaur</a>: The concept of feathered dinosaurs is rejected due to the misconception that dinosaurs were "big lizards".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a>: In real life, a kick to the groin is just as effective and dangerous against a woman as is against a man (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">less funny</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAreWorthless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAreWorthless">Guns Are Worthless</a>: Depending on the setting. In real life, it depends on the situation. A pistol won't do much against an armored car or a .22 caliber target gun would be next to useless for hunting grizzly bears.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardToLightFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardToLightFire">Hard-to-Light Fire</a>: In fiction, it usually takes someone a few seconds to make a fire. In reality, it can take upwards to over twelve hours!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadButtingPachy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadButtingPachy">Headbutting Pachy</a>: While pachycephalosaurs may have rammed their opponents in real life, their skull roofs were not as durable as in fiction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartInTheWrongPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartInTheWrongPlace">Heart in the Wrong Place</a>: It's never as far to the left as people think it is.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDensity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDensity">Hollywood Density</a>: Just because two blocks of material are the same size doesn't mean they're the same weight.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDrowning">Hollywood Drowning</a>: In movies, drowning victims thrash and scream for help. In real life, they're far more likely to paddle quietly for a few seconds and then sink.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking">Hollywood Hacking</a>: Hacking is fast and easy! No need to spend days finding weaknesses in the system, coding viruses, or anything un-dramatic like that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Horny Vikings</a>: If you don't have horns on your helmet, how will anyone know you're here to loot and pillage?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HydrantGeyser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HydrantGeyser">Hydrant Geyser</a>: Damaging a fire hydrant <em>always</em> results in a massive eruption of water, because municipalities certainly haven't gotten engineers to prevent that kind of thing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat">I Know Mortal Kombat</a>: Learning and performing extraordinary feats from watching movies, playing video games, etc. In real life, this can happen, though the success rate varies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorrectAnimalNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorrectAnimalNoise">Incorrect Animal Noise</a>: Many animals voices don't seem to fit an animal's looks, so they're replaced with more "fitting" voices.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncurableCoughOfDeath">Incurable Cough of Death</a>: If you cough, even once, you're on your way to the grave. You don't just have a cold or a tickle in your throat, oh no. May have something to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail">Law of Conservation of Detail</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet">Instant Death Bullet</a>: Fictional bullets can cause a person to drop dead of a chest or gut shot, even when a real person could probably keep moving (or talking, or moaning) for another few minutes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KensingtonGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KensingtonGore">Kensington Gore</a>: Fake blood people have come to associate with how "real" blood looks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla">Killer Gorilla</a>: Real-life gorillas are peaceful and non-violent animals, and when they do get provoked they prefer to stage mock-battles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown">Latino Is Brown</a>: The assumption that all latino/latina people are brown skinned and vaguely Native American in appearance, when in fact many have quite a bit of European, African or even Asian ancestry.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeadTheTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeadTheTarget">Lead the Target</a>: Sufficient distances require a weapon using bullets/shells to shoot "in front" of the target to make their trajectories intersect and thus hit. Fiction often ignores that or, on the other extreme, wildly exaggerates it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineFeminineGayCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineFeminineGayCouple">MasculineFeminine Gay Couple</a>: Despite this being common in media, not all gay couples are restricted to a strict masculine-feminine dynamic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiEthnicName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiEthnicName">Multi-Ethnic Name</a>: Where if you're not born on a certain continent, you can't have a first name that originated on that continent (like "John", "James", or "Mary" - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">all of which, by the way, originated in southwestern Asia</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap">Neck Snap</a>: It is possible to snap someone's neck with your bare hands, but it requires lots of strength and technique. Even then, it's never as easy, quick or clean as it is in fiction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverGetsFat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverGetsFat">Never Gets Fat</a>: Many real people make a habit of eating big in public, with only small meals if any in their free time. This can give the appearance of a mythical "fast metabolism".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops">Nobody Poops</a>: People in fiction never need to use the restroom unless the plot dictates it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDeadBodyPoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDeadBodyPoops">No Dead Body Poops</a>: In reality, only about 10% of mammalian deaths involve the body voiding its bladder or bowels upon death. In fiction, it either <em>always</em> happens or <em>never</em> happens.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolyKill">One Hit Poly Kill</a>: Mostly by accident. It's one of the main safety concerns of guns, and is called "overpenetration" in most gun circles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">Only a Flesh Wound</a>: Being shot in the shoulder, arm, or leg will merely slow down a fictional character. A real person, on the other hand, has large blood vessels in those places, not to mention bones that can be broken and require major surgery (and possibly amputation) on the injured limb.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInFlorida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInFlorida">Only in Florida</a>: Weird events aren't more prevalent in Florida than anywhere else; they're just more visible, by virtue of the state's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/how-floridas-proud-open-government-laws-lead-to-the-shame-of-florida-man-news-stories-7608595">"sunshine laws".<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveMaintenance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveMaintenance">Percussive Maintenance</a>: A device will <em>always</em> start working again if hit with the right force in the right place. Knowing where and how hard, however, is pretty much impossible without intimate knowledge of the device in question.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiranhaProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiranhaProblem">Piranha Problem</a>: Real piranhas are not as voracious as in fiction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">Politically Correct History</a>: Changing or removing uncomfortable facts from history in a work that is supposed to be historically accurate. Itself often used as a criticism towards regimes with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon-happy</a> attitude.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prehistoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prehistoria">Prehistoria</a>: In fiction, the land of dinosaurs is nothing but jungles, swamps, deserts, and volcanoes. In reality, it's far more varied and complicated.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalChestPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalChestPound">Primal Chest-Pound</a>: Real gorillas pound their chests with their palms, not their fists. They also make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackySoundEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackySoundEffect">"pop" sound</a> upon impact.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PteroSoarer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PteroSoarer">Ptero Soarer</a>: In fiction, a chilling combination of dinosaur and vampire bat. In reality, far more complex.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlingPlatypus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlingPlatypus">Puzzling Platypus</a>: Just... just platypuses, man. Those things should <em>not</em> exist.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandSucks">Quicksand Sucks</a>: Quicksand is deep and has active suction in fiction, even though the real stuff is fairly shallow and can be escaped with your own natural buoyancy and patience.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaptorAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaptorAttack">Raptor Attack</a>: Real <em>Velociraptors</em> were much smaller and would have behaved more like flightless eagles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealisticDictionIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealisticDictionIsUnrealistic">Realistic Diction Is Unrealistic</a>: Fictional dialogue is unrealistically polished.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReflectionlessUselessEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReflectionlessUselessEyes">Reflectionless Useless Eyes</a>: Most blind people don't have clouded or grey eyes. In real life, cataracts are the reason behind blind people having cloudy eyes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovableAnimalMarkings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovableAnimalMarkings">Removable Animal Markings</a>: In fiction, an animal's natural markings, such as spots or stripes, are removable.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovableShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovableShell">Removable Shell</a>: In fiction, a turtle's shell is a type of clothing or mobile home. In real life, it's its ribcage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhinoRampage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhinoRampage">Rhino Rampage</a>: While real rhinoceroses can be dangerous, they're not likely to attack you as a hippopotamus would.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticAsexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticAsexual">Romantic Asexual</a>: In media, most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality">asexuals</a> are aromantic. In real life, most asexuals <em>aren't</em> aromantic. Aromanticism is the least common "romantic orientation" (and some aromantics are not asexual).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubiksCubeInternationalGeniusSymbol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubiksCubeInternationalGeniusSymbol">Rubik's Cube International Genius Symbol</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> person with average intelligence and basic problem-solving skills is a match for a Rubik's Cube, but in fiction only an absolute genius can make all the sides the same color.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryScorpions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryScorpions">Scary Scorpions</a>: Real scorpions are not as deadly as the ones in fiction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceDoesNotWorkThatWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceDoesNotWorkThatWay">Space Does Not Work That Way</a>: In fictional space, <em>everyone</em> can hear you scream.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsCold">Space Is Cold</a>: It depends on exactly <em>where</em> you are in space. If you're in orbit above Mars, you will freeze, but in orbit above Venus, you'd fry like an egg. Neither one is instantaneous.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpidersAreScary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpidersAreScary">Spiders Are Scary</a>: Real spiders are not as deadly as the ones in fiction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAnimalDiet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAnimalDiet">Stock Animal Diet</a>: If an animal is eating food that's not part of its stereotypical diet, then it's weird.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockBeehive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockBeehive">Stock Beehive</a>: In fiction, wild beehives resemble hornet nests. In reality, not so much.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockObjectColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockObjectColors">Stock Object Colors</a>: An object must have a certain colour because the audience expects it so, else there must be something wrong with it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicolorScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicolorScience">Technicolor Science</a>: Pretty colors! Science is awesome!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelepathicSprinklers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelepathicSprinklers">Telepathic Sprinklers</a>: Real overhead fire sprinklers only go off if the temperature just below one is hot enough to trigger it. But in fiction, if one goes off, the rest will too.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreShort">Teens Are Short</a>: The need for an older actor to be believable as a teenager leads to casting actors that are uncommonly short. This leads to many situations where the teenagers are all somewhere around five feet when in real life most teenagers (especially 16-19) are the same height as their parents, or even taller.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark">Threatening Shark</a>: You're more likely to be struck by lightning than eaten by a shark. And even then, only <em>two</em> species of sharks are consistently dangerous to humans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthOldNewborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthOldNewborn">Three-Month-Old Newborn</a>: Because a TV or movie set is a bad place for a newborn, babies seen on TV and film tend to be about 3-4 months old.. .and don't <em>actually</em> look like newborns.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers">Too Smart for Strangers</a>: Most children who are kidnapped are taken by someone they <em>already</em> know and trust, including family members (such as parents in a custody battle). The stranger who allures children with candy/a sob story about a lost puppy/the promise of a ride home/whatever else is the exception, not the rule.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypicalCartoonAnimalColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypicalCartoonAnimalColors">Typical Cartoon Animal Colors</a>: An animal comes in a certain color expected by the audience, otherwise it would look weird.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyRealisticGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyRealisticGameplay">Unexpectedly Realistic Gameplay</a>: A sometimes-jarring moment when you need to apply commonsense, everyday logic to a videogame that typically works under its own logic and rules.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxHolstering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnorthodoxHolstering">Unorthodox Holstering</a>: While it may <em>look</em> cool, it's actually a very good way to injure or kill yourself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrealisticBlackHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrealisticBlackHole">Unrealistic Black Hole</a>: Portraying Black Holes as anything other than just a giant gravity field that will trap anything that passes its event horizon. The typical portrayal is more akin to a vacuum cleaner.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellIsThatAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellIsThatAccent">What the Hell Is That Accent?</a>: Obscure or heavy accents can sound fake to some listeners, especially if they live outside of the country being represented. People who have lived in several regions during their lifetime or have parents with different accents can end up with a mishmash of dialects all rolled into one. In addition, second language speakers with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGoodEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyGoodEnglish">Surprisingly Good English</a> (or equivalent) will often mix words from several dialects and elements of pronunciation.

<ul><li> Beer commercials, 'cause tropers love their drink:
<ul><li> You know how these always have a "beauty shot" with a glass of beer with a thick, frothy head? Beer doesn't really froth that much, but the average viewer thinks it should, so the advertisers add detergent to the beer to achieve the effect.
</li><li> Similarly, beer commercials are also fond of showing the head overflowing and spilling over the glass. Bartenders are told by their bar managers not to do that, as it wastes beer, and needlessly messes up the bar and the napkins. When the head overflows, you've poured too much.
</li><li> Besides, to get that beautiful head that consumers have come to expect, many a brewer have resorted to additives (for example E405, propylene glycol alginate). To get that head without those additives you have to pour the beer badly (straight into the glass, rather than down the side) or use a special foaming nozzle (once common in northern England).
</li></ul></li><li> Cereal commercials:
<ul><li> The "milk" they use is actually white paint with a little bit of turpentine mixed in. Apparently, it looks thicker and more real than actual milk. Real milk under studio lighting looks transparent and bluish, and less attractive than the PVA glue or white paint that usually stands in for it. (Milk also curdles quickly under hot film lights.)
</li><li> The milk-swirling-into-coffee images were similarly mocked up, usually with white paint and treacle (or Marmite in the UK). There was at least one photographer's studio in the UK in the 1980s dedicated to this kind of phototrickery.
</li><li> It's also unlikely you'll get a lot of steam off freshly served food, unless it's very hot, moist food in a quite cold room. The steam you see on TV? Probably a soggy microwaved tampon.
</li></ul></li><li> Remember those "Ask Dr. Z" commercials for what was then Daimler-Chrysler, with the actor with an odd-looking fake mustache and goofy German accent purporting to be the company's CEO and taking customers' questions? That was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Zetsche">the actual CEO of Daimler<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the accent and mustache are both real.
</li><li> Darker soft drinks, e.g. Coca-Cola, often have to be diluted significantly when photographed because they look too dark in their actual state.

<ul><li> Defied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> graphic novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanHush">Hush</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> is shot in the arm by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a>...and while she survives, in subsequent scenes, she is shown to be physically weakened from loss of blood.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand">Batman: No Man's Land</a></em>; a major American city gets hit by a national disaster, and the government basically leaves it to fend for itself, up to and including writing off the city and blowing the bridges out of town. Some people, including folks who liked the story, decried it as impossible, pointing out things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFEMAResponse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFEMAResponse">No FEMA Response</a>. Then Hurricane Katrina rolled over New Orleans, and it didn't seem quite so improbable anymore. (Of course, Gotham City is the DC Comics version of New York, which <em>would</em> likely receive more and faster aid than New Orleans if similarly damaged, but the point remains.)
</li><li> One particular nitpick among fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> is Murdock's ability to "feel" what color a piece of clothing is. While it's presented in a more superhuman light, a large number of legally blind people can still see colors, even if they can't make out specific objects clearly, and even completely blind people may be able to tell, particularly with their own items of clothing, by feeling different fabric textures, patterns, etc. and recalling that particular object's color.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Eyes of the Gorgon</a></em> - a battle between Medusa and Wonder Woman is being broadcast on national TV, and one of the viewers comments that "The CGI looks totally fake!".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> in one story from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>: Irma had been drafted to write the script of a musical based on the first saga, and the dialogue she wrote for a romantic scene was laughed at as too cheesy and unrealistic-except she had copied it from a phone call between Peter Cook and Cornelia (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">who was in the room</a>), the latter of which <em>is the base of one of the characters</em>.
</li><li> One common critique about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a> is often that they don't 'fit' with the rest of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, since their entire premise is based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>; it makes no sense for people to be OK with the Fantastic Four but not like the X-Men, simply because the X-Men gain their powers from being mutants. However, in real life, it's fairly common for people to be bigoted against one minority group but not have any issue with another, or even being good friends or <em>idealizing</em> people of one group while despising another, even if there's no real difference between the groups or what they can do. On top of that, its been shown that some people <em>do</em> hate non-mutant superhumans too, with Johnny Storm actually once getting attacked outside a nightclub by some bigots blaming him for the terrorist attack done by a <em>villain</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1twg7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1twg7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1twg7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a>, issue 1 (2006)</span>. To put it bluntly, of course the double standard is unreasonable, bigotry is is essentially unreasonable hatred against a group of people. (Of course, there's also the fact that the Four are led by an unbelievably handsome man - albeit with a plasticized body - while the two most prominent members of the X-Men are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfEvil">a somewhat sinister bald man</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCripple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCripple">in a wheelchair</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBloodedSideburns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBloodedSideburns">a long-sideburned punk</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws">with metal claws</a>.

<ul><li> In <em>The Aristocats</em>, Duchess' kittens are the ginger Toulouse, black-furred Berlioz, and snowball Marie. It should normally be impossible for such a litter to exist. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AllMyKittens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AllMyKittens">All My Kittens</a></em> explains this by Marie having a different father from her brothers: Marie's father was white-furred while her brother's was a fertile calico. It actually <em>is</em> possible for littermates to have different fathers if the queen mates with more than one tom within a certain period.
</li><li> Happened to Tonks in <em>The Awakening of a Magus</em>. She was quite plain looking while a child, but when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">She Is All Grown Up</a> trope started kicking in, everyone assumed she was using her recently manifested <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifter">Metamorphomagus</a> abilities. She resorted to using an appearance extrapolated from her earlier looks, which is implied to be the reason for her clumsiness, due to different balance and all.
</li><li> Some fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/WelcomeToNightVale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/WelcomeToNightVale">Welcome to Night Vale</a></em> can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">extremely picky about racial depictions</a> although it's a notoriously inclusive show.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Music </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The advent of the synthesizer allowed amateur songwriters to fake any number of musical instruments and other sounds to near-perfection. Because of that, people who enjoy the synthesized stuff would be mighty surprised when they're told that their favorite song was, in fact, played by a real band with real instruments.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> in particular were notorious for this; contrary to popular belief, the "no synths" disclaimer on their early albums wasn't because they had anything against synths even then, but because they were annoyed that Brian May's guitar proficiency and their overdub tricks were being mistaken for synth effects.
<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl">Dave Grohl</a> hired Brian May to play several guitar tracks on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a> song "Tired of You", he made a point of mentioning in interviews that the song is all guitar and vocals in case anyone mistook parts of it for strings or synths.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RageAgainstTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RageAgainstTheMachine">Rage Against the Machine</a> have a similar disclaimer on their albums that all sounds are made by guitar, drums, bass, and vocals. That didn't stop some reviewers from assuming Tom Morello's guitar solos on "Bulls On Parade" and "Guerilla Radio" were a turntable and harmonica respectively.
</li><li> When the trope comes back around and eats itself, you get the Alan Parsons Project, which was sometimes criticized for its (real) orchestral parts that, according to detractors, sounded like a keyboard player's idea of what an orchestral part sounded like. In other words, the orchestra was aping a keyboard aping an orchestra...
</li></ul></li><li> In an article about the use of pitch-correcting software in the music industry, one producer noted that singers who don't use the software get criticized by fans for sounding "pitchy". Ironically, the article was mainly about rappers who use the software to <em>intentionally</em> distort their voices. <br/><br/>The implication that electronic-sounding pop music (and only electronic-sounding pop music) is singled out for employing the same studio trickery, autotune, drag-and-drop editing and effects processing that almost all modern recording studios have access to in all styles of music doesn't help matters. This is also true with live performances and "mimed" TV appearances.
</li><li> As a general performing note, singing is quite different from normal talking and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">often contorts your face.</a> Since people don't often see the band in-studio and video shoots are often lip-synced or prettied-up, they <em>will</em> notice that when someone's performing live, they make some pretty strange expressions.
</li><li> Same thing with singers; lip-syncing scandals (like with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a>) have become so prevalent in the public memory in recent years that it comes as a shock to listeners when they're told a performer they swear is lip-syncing actually isn't.
</li><li> Producer Gus Dudgeon was often asked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> fans if Dudgeon sped up the tape when recording Elton's vocals on the title track to <em>Goodbye Yellow Brick Road</em>, as it has a very nasal, high-pitched quality to it. Dudgeon assured them that that was how Elton chose to sing it (he was known to experiment with his vocals at the time).
</li><li> Listeners often complain that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a> vocalist 2D sounds too different between singing and speaking to have realistically performed those songs. (In all fairness, he is played by two separate voice actors.) In reality, people can have dramatic differences between their speaking and singing voices: accents disappear, pronunciation becomes clearer, tones vary widely etc. It's not uncommon for someone with a thick accent or odd mode of speech to sound fine in recordings; learning to shift between voices is one of the first things aspiring vocalists are taught. For a perfect example, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> usually doesn't have the stereotypical "doodily-doodily-doo" guitar sound. You're probably thinking of either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairMetal">Hair Metal</a> (which is, relatively speaking, a footnote in the genre's history) or the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a>) and the American bands they inspired (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer">Slayer</a>). The earliest metal bands (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult">Blue Öyster Cult</a>) would <em>occasionally</em> perform hammer-ons, but for the most part their music wasn't especially technically accomplished and was really nothing more than standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock">Hard Rock</a> played at extreme volume. Hammer-ons didn't become semi-obligatory until the coming of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a> in 1978 - and even after that, many of the hair bands used them only sparingly, or sometimes not at all. Then, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal">Nu Metal</a> (Music/Slipknot, etc.) shifted the focus away from guitar solos and back toward riffs, albeit less pentatonic (blues-based) ones. (Ergo, what we have here is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope">Dead Unicorn Trope</a>.) Part of the problem is that popular culture (or, specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">people who know next to nothing about metal</a>) has for years pounded into viewers' brains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">a ridiculously cartoonish image of heavy metal</a>, complete with a crazy guitar sound, wild hair, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome">leopard-print spandex</a>.
</li><li> A lot of people in general tend to think demo versions of songs are sloppy low-quality takes which sound as if they'd been recorded through a telephone line. Fair enough, some of them are (e.g., demos recorded via portable recorders in the 70's), but many, many, many demos are recorded under similar circumstances as final cuts: at professional studios with multi-track technology and built-in limiters, etc. People often dismiss a demo as 'fake' if it sounds 'too good.'
<ul><li> For instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FosterThePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FosterThePeople">Foster the People</a>'s hit "Pumped Up Kicks" was a demo that Mark Foster recorded before forming the band. The band never re-recorded the song, so the version that became popular was that original demo!
</li><li> "It's My Party" by Lesley Gore (at that time, a 16-year old New Jersey schoolgirl taking voice and piano lessons) was produced and recorded, vocals, orchestra, brass section and all, as a demo recording in a small four-track studio in New York City by a young Quincy Jones over the course of a day and not meant to be released commercially. That changed after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilSpector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilSpector">Phil Spector</a> talked to Quincy Jones at a concert both attended of his plans to record the song with the Crystals; Quincy mixed the recording, released acetates to radio stations across the country over the course of that weekend and it reached #1 in a month.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-2460354661/great-expectations-beethoven-s-twenty-five-scottish">Ludwig van Beethoven was once commissioned to arrange some Scottish folk music for the piano.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Everyone praised how "realistic" the tunes he had "composed" were.
</li><li> A hot-ticket act for many years around Canada is The Musical Box, a fantastically accurate tribute band that plays spot-on performances of vintage (usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>-era) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a> music with spot-on theatrics; in fact, the only tribute band Genesis and Gabriel personally endorse and allow to perform with those theatrics. This is the closest you are going to come to a recreation of the band in its progressive rock heyday. This is until you technically take into account that Genesis performed to much smaller, feistier crowds, with less spit-and-polish than TMB use, lower-tech and less reliable sound equipment, lighting, musical instruments, theatrics and staging, and smaller road crews (if any). They were also flying by the seat of their pants as a young, naive, hungry unknown band playing unknown and weird experimental original music with unheard-of, weird, outrageous, experimental theatrics in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, with all the nerves, spontaneity and hunger to prove themselves you would expect out of such a band starting out.
</li><li> The same thing happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> once: when reviewing the 1998 remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Psycho</a></em> he complained of the evident electronically tweaked voice of the cop to make it sound unusually deep for effect. After someone wrote to him in the "Questions for the Movie Answer Man" column correcting him he had to add a footnote to later versions of the review saying, "I was wrong: that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRemar">James Remar</a>'s real voice."
</li><li> The contrast between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickAstley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickAstley">Rick Astley</a>'s youthful, slender appearance and his powerful baritone voice made many believe his singing was due to studio trickery, or even that he was lip-synching a black singer. Such rumors resurfaced with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Rickroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Rickroll">Rickroll</a> meme. But that is his natural voice.
</li><li> This is more about facelessness as opposed to sound techniques, but it definitely fits. Back in 1989, <em>Rolling Stone</em> did an article about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> as promotion for the release of <em>Green.</em> The article included R.E.M. performing at a club in their hometown in Athens, GA, where a patron is quoted as saying, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork">Who is this fucking R.E.M. cover band</a>?"
</li><li> Same with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a>, which until relatively recently received a crass depiction from mainstream media. It is <em>not</em> simply "metal with shorter haircuts."

<ul><li> Here's a neat wrestling example of both this trope <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>. Many people are surprised when they learn that the "blood" shed in particularly violent wrestling matches...really <em>is</em> blood. It's commonly assumed that the red stuff is just a bunch of squeezed blood capsules - and indeed, it was from capsules in the past - but these days, in order to counter accusations that wrestling is "fake" (which is pretty irrelevant by this point anyway) or that wrestlers are just actors and not true athletes, the performers have to "blade" (cut themselves when no one is looking) in order to make the blood "look" real. (And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">they get away with it</a>, because, really, does anyone want to believe that these zealots, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">devoted to sports-entertainment though they may be</a>, would go so far as to <em>actually</em> indulge in self-abuse for others' entertainment? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWouldReallyDoIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWouldReallyDoIt">The very idea!)</a> Conversely, the fact that there's bleeding at all could even be in itself an example of Reality Is Unrealistic, since some real-life fights may result in either no bloodshed or very little, though anyone who's watched bare knuckle boxing would attest that real fights can be <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN0hil4Fdek">extremely gory in some cases<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, making it at least partial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. So in conclusion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">in order to make a fictional thing look real, pro wrestlers use a real thing that's assumed to be fictional</a>.
<ul><li> Many wrestlers have been seriously injured because of this, and a handful have done very bad cutting...like nicking the vessels in the temple while cutting the scalp (which bleeds a lot).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston">Kofi Kingston</a> got hit with this at the beginning of his career. Despite being from Ghana, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToTheCaribbeanMon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToTheCaribbeanMon">billed as a Jamaican and coached to speak in the stereotypical accent</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">which he dropped a year later</a>. This may have been in part because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">WWE was worried that most fans would not know where Ghana was</a>, but it was mainly because Kingston's accent is <em>very</em> Americanized, and "no one" would have ever believed he wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeNationality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeNationality">an African-American trying (and failing) to pass for a native African</a>.
</li><li> Many of the physical feats seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> rings simply must be seen to be believed, because hardly anyone would ever believe you if you simply told them. While the astonishment could be due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless">the deceptively lean and/or compact bodies of some Superstars hiding a substantial amount of muscle mass</a>, another factor is that the matches are carefully choreographed (the moves often improvised, but those moves having been meticulously worked out by others in years past, and performers whispering the moves to each other during a match if that is the case) and both "competitors" cooperate to provide the "dominant" Superstar with leverage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli">Cesaro</a> opened a lot of eyes when he demonstrated his talent for swinging opponents around by their ankles for half a minute at a time, despite appearing to possess only average physical strength.

<ul><li> The 1990's World Cup Qualifiers of the Colombian National Football Team were filled with this trope, whereas the team was filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">memetic badasses</a> with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.colombiatravelguide.net/images/colombian_soccer_squad.jpg">the most cartoonish appearances possible<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. The team had such an uplifting effect on the otherwise violence-ravaged country at the time that the government actively campaigned for them to represent the actual Colombian values to the world. At one point, they were said to be serious contenders for the World Cup title, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3CsmUensKQ">until everything came tumbling down in an even more unrealistic and tragic manner.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The 2016 Handball European Championships. Germany was basically a bunch of nobodies from a country that just a few years prior had to be given a "wild card" to even make it to the world cup. They squeaked by in the first round (after a loss in the first round to Spain) and only made it to the semifinal with a lot of luck and dedication. The semifinal is another squeaker which gets them to the final... Against Spain...

</div></li><li> Cricket - the 1981 series between England and Australia. England's captain and all-rounder Ian Botham had suffered a spectacular loss of form both batting and bowling, and turned out to be a poor captain too. England lost the first match, barely hung on for a draw in the second, but Botham was dismissed for 0 in both of England's innings, and resigned as captain immediately after the match, about ten seconds before the national selectors said they had been going to sack him anyway. The previous captain, Mike Brearley, was brought out of retirement to act as temporary captain for the remainder of the series. Then in the third match, at Headingley in Leeds, everything went wrong for England: first Australia scored 401, England were all out for 174 (although Botham, at least, recovered a bit of form with bat and ball, scoring 50 and taking six wickets), then when England batted again they were reduced to 105/5 when Botham came in, and shortly afterwards 135/7: 92 runs behind, only three wickets left, and likely to lose by an innings. At this point the odds against an England victory were given as 500-1 (and a couple of Australian players even put a bet on it, apparently as a joke). What followed was one of the most amazing turnarounds in cricket history: Botham smashed his way to 149 not out, aided by Dilley (56) and Old (29), England's second innings reached a score of 356, and instead of winning by an innings, Australia had to chase a target of 130 to win or 129 to tie. It looked well within their capabilities when they reached 56/1, but after that they collapsed to 111 all out (eight of the nine wickets falling to Bob Willis), and England won the match by 18 runs. It was a change of fortunes so improbable that if it had been written as fiction it would have been dismissed as ludicrous. (Botham's fairytale recovery of form continued in the fourth and fifth matches of the series: in the fourth, Australia were again chasing a tiny target in the last innings, nearly got there, but collapsed to defeat, this time from Botham's own bowling as he took 5/11: and in the fifth match he smashed another century. England won the series 3-1 thanks to Botham's one-man efforts.)
</li><li> Brian Wilson, a closing pitcher for the San Francisco Giants, was said by one commentator to have "the fakest-looking real beard I've ever seen".
</li><li> The 2003-04 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague">English Premier League</a> title for Arsenal, on which they went completely undefeated. This is not only strange in world football, it only had happened once in the highest level of English football... 115 years before.
<ul><li> Which is nothing compared to Leicester City's Premier League title in the 2015-2016 season. For those not in the know, most European football leagues run on a tier system, where the top few teams in each of the lower tiers each season are promoted to the next tier while the bottom few in every tier above the lowest get relegated to the next one down; in England, it's a four-tiered system, with the Premier League at the top and the Football League Championship, Football League One, and Football League Two below in that order. Due to the economic inequalities involved on all levels, the same few teams tend to bounce up and down between tiers year after year, while the highest tier is dominated by a select few teams. Leicester City was, for quite some time, one of those teams that tended to bob up and down—in their history dating back to the 1894-1895 season, their longest stretch at the top tier was 12 years from 1957-1969, and their longest stretch at <em>any</em> tier was 14 years at the second tier (starting with their founding). So is this just your usual underdog story? No, that doesn't begin to capture it. It took a furious closing stretch to the 2014-2015 season just for Leicester City to avoid being relegated back to Championship—a common fate for those who've just been promoted, as Leicester City had following a 2014 Championship title—which itself came just five years after a <em>League One</em> title. The preseason oddsmakers had Leicester City at 5000-to-1 to win the Premier League, which doesn't sound like much, but actually exceeds anything you'll ever get in American sports—to get up to 5,000-to-1 odds with the British bookmakers, you have to go to stuff like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvisLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvisLives">confirmed sightings of a living Elvis Presley.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> How long has it been between triple plays where the batter wasn't retired? Almost as long as it took for the Chicago Cubs to get their third World Series title. And yet, the Texas Rangers did just that. And yes, everyone—the Rangers, the Los Angeles Angels, their managers, the umpires, the broadcasters, and even those watching—had no idea just what in the hell was going on. The players themselves, including the runner at first base, thought they were just dealing with a line drive gone barvy.
</li><li> Imagine seeing this on TV: It's the 4th quarter of a basketball game, one team was on the losing side, and there was only about one minute left on the counter. People were packing up and leaving, thinking that the rival team won this one for sure. Not backing down, one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">determined</a> player rose to the challenge and managed to score thirteen points in thirty seconds, securing his team a narrow victory. Sounds like something out of a Hollywood sports movie, right? Except that was how the match between the Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs happened in 2004. And that player who won his team the game? Future Hall-of-Famer Tracy <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGrady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGrady">Mc Grady</a>.
</li><li> Japan's 34-32 victory over South Africa in the 2015 Rugby World Cup was the biggest upset in Rugby World Cup history, and arguably in the sport's history. Two weeks earlier, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eFI6EP2sJw?t=99">a reviewer of the Rugby World Cup 2015 video game<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had commented that its simulation of matches in the pool stages "just ends up in weirdness sometimes", citing Japan beating South Africa as an example, adding that "in no reality does that happen". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheFlyingPigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheFlyingPigs">Cue the Flying Pigs</a>.

<ul><li> The 1991 World Series in its entirety. Seven contests, all won by the home team, four - including the climactic Game 7 - won in extra innings; Game 7 won in a 10 shutout by a veteran starting pitcher who went all 10 innings. And both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">Minnesota Twins</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">Atlanta Braves</a> having finished last in their division the previous year.
</li><li> The 2001 World Series deserves a mention as well. The upstart Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the venerable New York Yankees in seven games with the home team winning each game and two of the three games in New York being won in a walk off, as was Game 7 in Arizona. All done in the shadow of 9/11.
</li><li> The St. Louis Cardinals' path to the 2011 World Series definitely fits this trope. They were 10 1/2 games back from the wild card spot and most people assumed they wouldn't make the playoffs. Then they starting winning. And winning. And winning some more. And the Atlanta Braves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">crashed and burned</a>. The Cards faced off against the Phillies, whom sports writers called "the best team in baseball". Then Cards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">ace pitcher</a> Chris Carpenter shut out his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival">Friendly Rival</a> Roy Halladay. Then they toppled the Brewers, who had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Draco Malfoy-esque</a> Nyjer Morgan on their team. And then they faced off against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBigInTexas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBigInTexas">Texas</a> Rangers and were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">Down To The Last Strike</a> <em>twice</em> in Game 6 (and were down 3-2 for the entire series) when a hometown kid named David Freese tied the game with a triple and eventually won it with a walk-off home run. The next night, they took Game 7 and the Series. If this had been a movie, critics would have torn it apart because it would have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">Cliché Storm</a> of most of the underdog sports tropes on this site. But in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, it was one of the most jaw-droppingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperrific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperrific">Troperrific</a> playoffs in baseball history.
</li><li> The 2019 Washington Nationals had perhaps one of the most improbable runs in MLB history. A perennially-cursed team that had yet to make even the National League Championship Series since their inception in 2005 (they had made the NLCS once as the Montreal Expos in 1981, but lost to the Dodgers), the Nationals had just lost their former MVP outfielder, Bryce Harper, in free agency. Their first 50 games saw them stumble out of the gate to a 19-31 record. But over the remaining games, the Nats went 74-31, clinching a wild card spot. There, they beat the Milwaukee Brewers on a clutch three-run single by Juan Soto, who proved to be a capable replacement for Harper. They went on to face the 106-win Dodgers, and despite an early 3-0 deficit in the winner-take-all Game 5, the Nationals rallied to tie the game with consecutive home runs off ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Clayton Kershaw''</a>. That set up Howie Kendrick's 10th-inning grand slam, giving Washington a 7-3 win. They proceeded to sweep the red-hot St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, heading to their first World Series against a loaded Houston Astros team. In a series that went the full seven games, the Nationals lost their three home games, but won all four games played in Houston to take home their first ever title. It was the first time the road team had won all games in a series in any American sports league. And the MVP of the series? Stephen Strasburg, the Nats' #1 overall pick in 2009. A sweet ending for a man who struggled with injuries throughout his career.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2016 season of Seattle Sounders FC in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueSoccer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueSoccer">Major League Soccer</a>. Shortly before the start of the season, the Sounders lost one of their high-profile players to the Chinese Super League. A string of inconsistent and poor performances led to the team spending much of the first half of the season below the playoff line, at one point sitting at the bottom of the Western Conference. After the firing of head coach Sigi Schmid and his replacement by then-assistant coach Brian Schmetzer, as well as the signing of Designated Player Nicolás Lodeiro, the Sounders went on a run of form rarely seen in MLS, carrying the team all the way to the MLS Cup finals. There, despite the Sounders not registering a single shot on goal, a tight defense (and a miraculous save from GK Stefan Frei) led to penalty kicks and the Sounders' first MLS Cup win in their history of being an MLS team.
</li><li> There's this Quarterback. Let's call him P.M. He is by all measurable (and some unmeasurable) categories the best of his era. However, any team he plays for suffers from chronic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">Every Year They Fizzle Out</a> - and the blame is often (justly or unjustly) put on him. Cue his last season (for all we know) where he plays horribly but for the first time in <em>ages</em> is surrounded by a good or even above average defense and special teams. Of course he makes it to the Super Bowl (beating his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBrady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBrady">longtime rival</a> with a reputation of being "clutch" in a 20:18 squeaker that went down to the wire to get there) against the undisputed MVP and probably one of the best young QBs of his era. Of course "P.M." wins his game. Of course this all just too cheesy to be true. Only that it is the story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Peyton Manning</a> and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50.

</li><li> There's a guy...we'll call him Andy. He graduated with a degree in economics from a prestigious college, where he starred on the basketball team. After a few brief gigs as an NBA assistant he takes an executive job with a startup software company. While there, he dates a Maxim magazine cover model and they bond over a shared love of sports (their first date is a basketball game followed by dinner at Taco Bell) and get married. But he misses coaching and gets a job as an assistant at a large university. After a few years he takes a head coaching job at an obscure university that had only had a basketball team for 10 seasons, and had only been in existence for 14 years. After a losing record in his first year, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a> team use their exciting brand of basketball to win an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Andys #15-seeded team shocks the nation with a decisive victory against a traditional power in round 1, then pulls off another upset to become the lowest seeded team ever to reach the Sweet 16. There they play against the most prominent team from their home state, who had shunned the upstart school in the past. Andys team jumps to a big first half lead but runs out of gas and loses. Still, the team becomes the darling of the basketball world, and Andy accepts a job offer from one of the most glamorous schools in all of college sportsGood luck pitching that story to Hollywood without getting laughed out of the room. Except, thats the true story of Andy Enfield, Amanda Marcum and the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles 2013 NCAA tournament run.

<ul><li> Players and reviewers often complained about how unrealistic it was that wielding a weapon with a burst fire setting doesn't give you the effects of the game's Burst Fire feat. As the game's designers have pointed out, the point of the burst fire setting on guns is to ensure you only fire the three to five rounds in an automatic burst that have any realistic chance of actually hitting the target. If you don't know how to effectively fire an accurate burst with an automatic weapon, this setting won't make it any easier.
</li><li> This game got this in a lot of respects. Many players and reviewers compained about how a submachine gun could easily kill a character in the early levels of the game (where the median hitpoints could be around 7 or 8 at first level and a submachine gun could deal 2d6 (2-12)). The logic on why this was bad? Because SMGs shoot 'little pistol bullets' and everyone knows from movies those only wound you, not kill you.

It makes things in the affected area to be perceived as less believable, whether they are real or not. Of course, in this case Illusion/Phantasm magic aura actually <em>helps</em> the effect if detected. The whole point is that a harmless spell becomes ridiculously lethal once the victims disregard as "fake and tacky" something like a swooping dragon — or even a badly disguised trap.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em>, the first victim is killed with a glass bottle to the forehead, leading to people to question why it didn't shatter, leaving it to be presented in court intact (made worse by the fact that the series is based on finding such contradictions, but asking this in game isn't an option and a previous game in the series featured a bottle that broke when someone was hit non-lethally). Glass is not as fragile as depicted in Hollywood, and the process used to make the bottle (of which there are several) and the quality and amount of material used are a factor. In fact, the non-lethal broken bottle from the previous game was likely a cheaper product, and was non-lethal because it broke, which absorbed a significant amount of the energy involved, while the unbroken bottle would have transferred more energy into the skull, thus causing more damage. The common misconception of Soft Glass exists because scenes where glass is broken don't use real glass  they used to use "sugar glass" (essentially, flat rock candy), and now just use a plastic "breakaway glass".
</li><li> The entire series falls into this, for most people. The Japanese legal system is represented in game in an exaggerated and outright over the top fashion but it is represented nonetheless. Ask the average player of the games and they'll tell you that the legal system of the Ace Attorney world is so unrealistically absurd that it borderlines over the top. But in reality, the only thing that's not true to real life, is the contents of the cases themselves and how fast-paced and twisty the trials are. The laws, trial procedures, treatment of the defense, and "guilty until proven innocent" motto are all in fact true to the Japanese Bench System, which the games are based on.
</li><li> The act of calling a parrot to the stand in the first game seems ridiculous (the person who brings it up as a possibility does so to mock Phoenix), for good reason, but in actuality, such a thing has happened in real life trials before, and the idea of using words a parrot can speak as legal evidence is something that has happened before. The absurd part is how the game presents it in the context of such a serious moment in a murder trial, along with the way the parrot's cross-examination is treated in the same manner as that of an ordinary person's, rather then how it would realistically be if you were to use a parrot's understanding of human language as proof.
</li><li> One of the cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusEpisode">Turnabout Big Top</a>, is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">the worst among fans</a>, with one of the reasons being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">absurd coincidences</a> which answer a lot of the cases riddles. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Such as- how did a witness, Moe, see the defendant fly away? The killer, Acro, who just happened to have an exact murder plot which involved dropping a heavy object out a window, used a random object that his monkey pet has in his stash, which just happened to be a bust of the defendant, Max Galactica. And the victim, the ringmaster, just happened to wear the defendant's clothes, and when the bust fell onto him, the defendant's cloak just happened to fly forward off him and snag onto the bust. Then the killer pulled the bust on a rope back up.</span> So when the witness looked out the window, it was only by an absurd string of coincidences that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he saw the defendant's silhouette 'flying' upwards as the killer pulled the bust up</span>. And it was also only by these absurd coincidences that the defendant ended up being the prime suspect. In actual fact though, what's not realistic is the typical murder plots seen in Ace Attorney where everything's completely planned out. If anything, this case is one that'd be more likely to happen in real life then most.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJudge">The regular judge</a> in the series is portrayed often as a feeble-minded old man, who has trouble keeping up with the proceedings. However, you'll often see people lumping moments in which the judge asks for clarification over a specific thing that he should already know about as a judge, or something that <em>anyone</em> should know, into being part of this character trait. For example, he asks Edgeworth to explain exactly what he means, when he says that the defendant has lost her chance of escaping criminality for her killing.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0w6v1');"><sup>Note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0w6v1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0w6v1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The victim had attacked the defendant, so justified self-defense was at first thought likely. But the autopsy concluded that the victim was struck twice, and that the first blow knocked him unconscious. So the second, killing blow, was delivered to someone the defendant knew had already been fully immobilized.</span> In fact, this is a realistic and common thing for judges to do during a trial, and they're very often quoted as asking for clarification on what something rather common place is, or for a legal dispute to be given more clarity or put into more simplistic wording. This is mainly for the sake of those in the courtroom such as the jurors, and the actual sides involved in the case, as well as the gallery, who may not understand what is being talked about. As stated on the show <em>QI</em>:
<div class="indent"> Stephen: <em>Judges have to make sure that absolutely everything in the course of the trial is abundantly clear to everyone in the courtroom, particularly the members of the jury. So judges often ask for such clarification on behalf of everyone else, because you never know when there's that one woman who's been living in a cave for the last hundred years and honestly doesn't know who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> are. That's why you often see judges being quoted as asking stuff like, "So, what exactly is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">Muppet</a>?".</em>

You'll often see people bring up "unrealistic" aspects of Uendo's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">multiple personality disorder</span>, such as how he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has four personalities, how one of his personalities is a different gender, the fact that all but one share the same memories and switch in when they feel like it, and that his "child" personality who thinks himself five years old comes out whenever he passes out drunk</span>.

Differing genders, being in "dissonant" (aka, not in control but still conscious and aware) while other personalities are in control), hidden personalities that other altars do not know about, differing ages between personalities, and even the idea of a certain altar appearing when someone gets drunk, are all, in fact, common aspects of DID</span> The typical <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde">one "normal/good" personality, and one "evil" personality who share seperate memories</a>)</span> as depicted in fiction is a <em>very</em> rare occurrence of it in real life.

</li><li> Almost any photography blog (or any blog where someone puts up scenic photos in general) will immediately attract a flood of commenters complaining that the image is 'obviously Photoshopped'. Of course, a talented photographer is perfectly capable of capturing an impressive shot without resorting to Photoshop software to touch it up, but try telling them that. In many cases, comments of these nature indicate that the commenter is either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">troll</a> just trying to stir up trouble or just unfamiliar with professional grade SLR cameras. Point-and-shoot cameras have about as much in common with these SLRs as, say, a butter knife has with a chainsaw. Many effects you can get with an expensive manually controlled camera really are impossible with a point-and-shoot. Moreover, many commenters are unaware that effects have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">long</a> been added to traditional film photos in the development process.
</li><li> As modern vehicles have been fitted with increasing levels of electronic driving aids the sorts of tyre squealing, rubber burning, back end sliding maneuvers typically seen in chase scenes are no longer possible without intentionally disabling such features first. When such features are on vehicles will maintain almost full traction no matter what sort of craziness the driver attempts to do. The result is not only vehicle behavior that looks completely alien, but also one that is quite dull to watch.
<ul><li> There's another layer of unrealistic reality here, as many cars' traction control systems will interfere with the performance of the powertrain, say by cutting fuel. Hard cornering while accelerating is very much hampered by most traction control systems, so it's very common for a performance driver to turn them off (or to a less intrusive setting).

Similarly, Metalbending was considering <em>genuinely impossible</em>. Once Toph worked out how it works she is almost immediately able to bend metal as easily as earth. With a Metalbending master to show others the basics, it's unsurprising that it would spread very rapidly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus">The Magic School Bus</a></em>: Arnold's "block of ice" moment during the climax of "Gets Lost in Space" seems implausible enough that it gets brought up in the Producers Segment. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/survival-in-space-unprotected-possible/">It has since been established that you can, in fact, survive brief exposure to outer space.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> in the episode "Dethstars." The band's helicopter breaks open an oil rig, spewing oil on hundreds of people, one of whom is smoking a cigar that ignites the oil, causing the rig and everyone on it to go up in flames. As the band flies away, Murderface looks down at the burning wreckage and says "That is so fake."
</li><li> A case of skin color confusion: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily">The Proud Family</a></em>, LaCieniga is obviously Hispanic, and takes after her mother (who has dark skin). Felix also obviously looks pretty Hispanic as well (but is lighter), but his father Papi is white and could pass for being white European. There was actually a bit of debate where people assumed that Felix's mother was Hispanic and that he's only half Hispanic. In reality, there is such a thing as being "white Hispanic" and Papi most likely is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied where a Hollywoodesque special effects team paints a horse's skin in a cow pattern, because "real cows don't look like cows on-screen." When asked how they would make something look like a <em>horse</em> on-screen, they suggest stringing a bunch of cats together.
</li><li> In another episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, the guest star was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWaters">John Waters</a>. John Waters' real mustache is basically a very straight thin line across his upper lip. However, in the cartoon, he had a wavy moustache. In the audio commentary, the reason John Waters' straight thin moustache was replaced by a wavy line was because John Waters' real moustache would just look like a straight line over his lip and disappear. John Waters said he actually liked it, but considered that it would be difficult to shave his moustache to look like that.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Satan's Super Sweet Sixteen", an in-universe example occurs when Steve Irwin shows up to the party, stingray barb still in his chest. People think he's a guy in a tasteless costume at first, but he is asked to leave once it's revealed that he is Steve Irwin (because he has no costume).
</li><li> Parodied in one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> episode in which Mr. Krabs pulls his way to use the sponge himself as a promotional money-making tool for the Krusty Krab, after a food critic complimented him. He makes Spongebob <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">leave his current position to manually work on a ride, having set up Squidward, in costume, for his place</a>. After tiring out, Spongebob gets attacked with insult and mockery for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork">not looking like the real thing</a>. It's not until the end of the episode that Mr. Krabs fixes things up.
</li><li> One of The Spill.com's biggest complaints about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> Movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TMNT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TMNT">TMNT</a></em> is that Splinter's voice doesn't sound Asian, when in fact it was voiced by the famed Japanese actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mako" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mako">Mako Iwamatsu</a>. (They were probably thrown by the fact a Japanese accent doesn't sound much like the played-up Cantonese accent used for all Asian people in most Western media.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>:
<ul><li> One complaint about the character design of Artemis was how she's half Asian but has blond hair. Greg Weisman responded that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=13138">she's actually based on one of the producer's daughters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose parents are both half Asian and has natural blond hair, because both could have inherited the blond gene from their non-Asian parents. However, Artemis' mother is Vietnamese and Weisman mentions elsewhere that Artemis is fluent in French, due to Vietnam being a former French colony. If Artemis has at least one French maternal ancestor, it is plausible.
</li><li> When we finally see her father, Artemis has the exact same color hair as he does.
</li><li> More recently, the fandom has gone after her for having dark eyebrows, taking this as "proof" that she dyes her hair. They are, however, ignoring two critical pieces of information: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that her hair is natural, and blond people often have eyebrows that are much darker than their natural hair color.
