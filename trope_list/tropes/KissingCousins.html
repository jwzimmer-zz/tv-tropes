A great many cultures today accept it, including a majority of the industrialized world.
</p><p>Marrying one's extended relatives (which is technically known as <em>clan endogamy</em>) <a class="urllink" href="http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2013/03/18/Fossil-hints-at-human-inbreeding/UPI-89081363654130/">seems to have been common in human evolutionary history<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, since hominids usually lived in small nomadic bands with few available sexual partners. At the other end of the spectrum, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">much of the modern U.S.A. considers cousin marriage completely taboo</a>, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> at the very mention of it. People from backwoods areas (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Appalachia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Appalachia">the Appalachian Mountains</a>) are often the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">preferred butt of many bad jokes</a> as well as occasional bits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a> for the alleged prevalence of Kissing Cousins in their culture.

Legal or not, these marriages are still not very common due to the lingering cultural taboo. All states permit marriages between second and third cousins, but even these are looked at funny. In the UK, first cousin marriage is unusual and would be regarded as rather odd, but not with the same severity as the US. Second cousin marriages and beyond would be seen as unremarkable. In several other western countries, specially the ones that are majority catholic, first cousins marriages were common and usually are not considered a taboo, although starting to become more looked down upon in the modern age due to globalization and the consequent import of US culture, although they are still quite common in rural areas.

Full scholarly debate on why some cultures would forbid cousins to marry while others ignore or encourage it rages on and lies beyond the scope of this wiki.
</p><p>According to both Oxford and Merriam-Webster's Dictionaries, the original definition of <em>kissing cousins</em> was simply a relative known well enough to be given a kiss in greeting, although this meaning has long since fallen by the wayside.

<ul><li> In one of the earlier cases, the killer's motive for killing his grandfather, etc. was because he fell in love with his cousin, and the older man forbids them from marrying. The killer's parents were also cousins, and the patriarch reluctantly agreed to their marriage.
</li><li> The series had already hinted that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mary Sera</span> may or may not be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elena Miyano's sister</span>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated during an interview in Singapore that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shuuichi Akai and Akemi Miyano were indeed cousins.

</li><li> Masahiko and Shion from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FamilyCompo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FamilyCompo">Family Compo</a></em> are cousins and there's often a sense attraction between the two. The manga starts with Masahiko saying Shion is cute before he learns she's his cousin. Oddly the series keeps on swaying between Masahiko being Sora's and Yukari's parent figures, and likewise whether Shion and Masahiko are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a> or are attracted to one another.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>; while the cursed members of the Sohma family occasionally refer to each other as "cousins" or "relatives" and some of them have romantic feelings for each other, it's often implied that they're only very distantly related or not related at all (none of their parents are mentioned as being related). The Sohmas are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">clan</a> of 150 members, not simply a large family.

In the same series, he gets so angry when he hears about Hinata trying to date Naruto, that he attacks Hinata in fury, and it's not just the big brother instinct anymore, but plain jealousy. Bear in mind that their fathers were identical twins, meaning that Neji and Hinata share 25% of their genes (meaning they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">genetic half-siblings</a>), as opposed to the 12.5% that would normally be the case for first cousins.

</li><li> The First Hokage, Hashirama Senju might do this when he married Mito Uzumaki, as the Uzumaki are an offshoot of the Senju.

</li><li> Being set in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy">Medieval European Fantasy</a> world, this is prevalent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>. The most prominent example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Tywin Lannister</a>, who married his cousin Joanna, and there are several other minor examples mentioned.
<ul><li> Tywin and Joanna's daughter Cersei is also sleeping with her cousin Lancel (her cousin on Twyin's side, if you're curious). It becomes a plot point, thanks to how sensitive that information is—though not because he's her cousin, but because she's the king's widow, and how jealous her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">twincestuous</a> brother is. Yeah, it kinda runs in their family... and has done for centuries: there are two main lines of Lannisters, the ruling family based in Casterly Rock and the cadet, Lannisport branch in charge of the harbour, customs and navy. They crisscross regularly. What? Do you really think the Rock could ever trust another House to run their trade hub?
</li><li> Ned Stark's parents Rickard and Lyarra were first cousins once removed, Lyarra being the daughter of Rickard's grandfather's brother.
</li><li> The Targaryens, due to their obsession with blood purity, would marry their siblings, or cousins if they did not have a sibling to marry. Viserys I married an Arryn cousin, from whom the current generation of Targaryens are descended. Around the Dance of the Dragons, the Targaryen intermarriages with each other and their relatives the Velaryons makes for a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">Tangled Family Tree</a> (though maybe less inbred considering Rhaenyra's "Velaryon" children were more likely the result of an affair, though they all died without issue).
</li><li> Also, due to the fact that the Baratheons are descended from Aegon the Conqueror's bastard half-brother, the bride and groom in any Targaryen-Baratheon marriage will at the very least be distant cousins (one case was actually an aunt-nephew marriage, since the groom's grandmother remarried to a Baratheon and had a daughter). The same is true for any marriage between the Targaryens and Martells after the reign of Daeron II, due to Daeron marrying the Prince of Dorne's sister, while his sister married the Prince.
</li><li> Lord Wyman Manderly at one point suggests him or his second son Ser Wylis marrying his cousin Lady Donella Hornwood, partially hoping to get her lands for sure, but also as an attempt to protect her because taking care of your own is something House Manderly actually cares about. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> House Bolton is, as a result, directly in their crosshairs thanks to how terribly Ramsay treated Donella when he forced her to marry him — then "let" her die alone.</span>

</li><li> In <em>Un grito en las tinieblas; la vida de Zárate Arkham</em>, the titular character sleeps with her cousin, although both of them were possessed by the spirits of their uncle and his female servant respectively—which make the sex scene a case of double incest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em> has this combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>, seeing as they're semi-realistic cats, and they live in Clans that don't allow intermixing, this is kind of inevitable, and there are several such relationships like this:
<ul><li> Squirrelflight and her mate Brambleclaw are second cousins.
</li><li> Hawkfrost and Pebbleshine are cousins.
</li><li> Lilyheart and Snowbush are cousins.
</li></ul></li><li> Rand al'Thor is worried about this when he considers courting the Andoran Daughter-Heir Elayne Trakand in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> after he learns that he is descended from Andoran royalty on his mother's side, making them distant cousins. He is reassured after an expert on genealogy informs him that if they were both commoners, they wouldn't be considered related.
</li><li> Even besides the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a> romance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights">Wuthering Heights</a></em>, there are, not coincidentally, two subsequent cousin-cousin relationships.

Furthermore, when these feelings become mutual, Maeby tries to hide from them by dating a boy from her school, who turns out to <em>also</em> be her cousin. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though also first cousins by adoption, then revealed as second cousins once removed by blood.</span>) This was mirrored in two storylines in the final season. The first saw Michael Bluth (played by Jason Bateman) thinking that a prostitute was his long-lost sister and hiring her to work at the company; she thought this was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyWoman">Pretty Woman</a></em> situation and started coming on to him. (The prostitute was played by Justine Bateman, who is Jason Bateman's real-life sister.) Then, in the third season finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it was revealed that Lindsay was adopted and was not actually Michael's biological sister. Upon finding out, she decided to act on a crush she had had for years. Then in the fifth season finale it was revealed that Lindsay is Lucille's half-sister</span>. Additionally, Michael ended up going out with a woman who, unbeknownst to him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> suffered from mental retardation as a result of her parents being cousins.</span> It was a lot funnier and less creepy than this sounds.
</li><li> Relatively common in Hispanic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Operas</a>. During Venezuelan soap <em>Carita Pintada</em>'s pre-premiering the author claimed that the main couple could achieve a happy ending with a white wedding and all because they were <em>only</em> third or second cousins, coincidentally the closest blood relation allowed to marry according to actual laws. For the most (emphasis there) part in Latin America, people consider cousin relationships to be too incestuous only if they are first cousins; second cousins and onward are not subject to this taboo.
</li><li> This is not uncommon in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Operas</a> in general, given the frequency of "true parentage is revealed" storylines that can make previous non-relatives with crushes on each other into cousins.

At least, until they go back to his place and she notices a picture of her great aunt. They do the math and figure they are third cousins (i.e. sharing a great-great-grandparent). There's a discussion on how closely related they could be without it being creepy. He says fifth cousins. She says <em>never</em>.

<ul><li> In Season 2, while Jaime is captured by the Starks, Cersei ends up sleeping with her cousin Lancel because, according to the books, he physically resembles a young Jaime. While cousin relationships are not uncommon in Westeros, this establishes Cersei's disturbing habit of shaking the family tree for a bed partner.
</li><li> Also, like in the books, Tywin Lannister married his cousin Joanna, who died giving birth to Tyrion. The practical result is that her surname was already "Lannister" even before she married Tywin. In part, this also informs how much of a hypocrite Tywin is. He plans to force all three of his children to marry against their will to secure political alliances, demanding that they put the good of the family above their own personal happiness. Problem is, Tywin <em>himself</em> married for love  marrying a first cousin meant he didn't secure a marriage alliance with another powerful Great House.

Nobody mentions that it's technically incest, and they eventually do fall in love. If you do the calculations, they're fourth cousins. Likewise, Mary had been betrothed to the previous heir (before he died in the <em>Titanic</em> sinking), who was her <em>second</em> cousin.

</li><li> The second set are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Male Avatar and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a> Azura—their mothers Mikoto and Arete were sisters</span>. The twist is they <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest">don't know</a></em> they're cousins, and they don't find out until quite late in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenPath">Golden Path</a> (and note, <em>only</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenPath">Golden Path</a>, meaning in the other two they never find out). Even after they learn the truth, though, their S-support is explicitly romantic, making them the straight example. Of course, if <em>they</em> don't marry each other, it's possible for their respective <em>children</em>, who would be second cousins, to marry each other. And if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Avatar marries any of Azura's children</span>, he/she'll end up marrying his/her first cousin once removed.
</li><li> It's also possible to pull off other couples like this depending on how the player pairs up the royal sisters. If Hinoka, Sakura, Camilla, or Elise marry any of the men who have daughters, the player can then hook these second-gen girls up with Shiro or Kiragi (for Hinoka and Sakura), or Siegbert or Forrest (for Camilla and Elise). For example, a Caeldori mothered by Hinoka is still perfectly capable of marrying her cousin Shiro.

(A certain cheat will allow them to have offspring if the player so chooses). However, more distantly related Sims have the ability to seek romantic interactions with one another (probably because the family tree in the game does not recognize first cousins once removed and beyond, or great-grandparents for that matter).
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a>'s little cousin Nanako tells him that she wants to marry him when she grows up, and apparently won't take "no" for an answer.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully">Bully</a></em>, the Preppies are the kids of a bunch of inbred rich people.

Dorian brings this up at one point, and if a male Inquisitor is engaged in a romance with him he has the option of asking whether it's okay to continue flirting or not. Dorian's fine with it, as it's <em>very</em> distant (three whole Ages, if he's being literal).
