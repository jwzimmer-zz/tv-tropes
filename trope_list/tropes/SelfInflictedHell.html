</div></div><p>An increasingly popular trope in fantasy novels is the idea that whatever you expect to happen when you die is pretty much what you get  effectively, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>.
</p><p>So if you believe that your soul will remain chained to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Karma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Karma">karmic wheel</a> and you'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">reincarnated</a> as a cow, then that's what will happen. If you believe you'll sit at the right hand of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> and sing hosannahs, that's what will happen. If you believe there is nothing after death, then all you'll find is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNothingAfterDeath">nothing</a>. If you believe that you'll <em>become</em> nothing after death, then that's just what you'll do  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">or not do</a>. If you believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">Fire and Brimstone Hell</a>, but don't see yourself as worthy of escaping it, then down you go. Of course, it means generally good but unduly guilt-ridden people will go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a>, while people that spend their lives picketing funerals will go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a>, but nobody said it was <em>fair</em>.

If you made a depressing suicidal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy">tragic</a> life full of regrets and unwanted memories, then the replay of these memories would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> you to Absolute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>, and you would become a Pessimist with low self-esteem.
</p><p>Your pessimism would then generate an isolated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension">Pocket Dimension</a> within an impenetrable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Absolute Terror Field</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Witch Barrier</a> that isolates yourself from the hope and light of God, other souls, or the virtues they represent, for all of eternity or until you somehow manage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanicPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanicPrison">tear away your self-inflicted torment and break free</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is somewhat similar to the Christian conception of Hell, where Hell is what a person inflicts upon themselves by rejecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>, which God can't stop without taking away their Free Will. This is demonstrated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels">Parable of the Prodigal Son</a> courtesy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> himself. The Prodigal Son (sinners) left the father (God) thinking that it is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost">better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven</a>", but eventually he realized the futility of his ways, and the father is more than happy to take the son back and forgive him.
</p><p>Adherents of <em>Universal Reconciliation</em> take this further and say that Eternal Separation isn't eternal. If God is all forgiving, and you asked for forgiveness, then God is more than happy to forgive you and the eternal separation won't last. Only the Fallen's own pride and hatred are the very factors that keep them from doing just that, delaying their salvation. For this reason, Universalism is incompatible with this trope's belief-making damnation, for if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">person believes they will cease to exist</a>, they can never be reconciled, <em>for there is no one there to forgive</em>.

As stated above, a total monster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">may refuse and thus escape that sort of retribution</a> due to lack of empathy and remorse; an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex">overly sensitive</a> but well-meaning decent person may choose to carry that burden, akin to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution">Misplaced Retribution</a>. Why would the benevolent deity in question allow that injustice to happen? Claims that one would be forced to endure their worst nightmares based solely on specific actions they commit, regardless of how they feel about it, could explain this, though what precisely are the choices that condemn a person, and whether that judgement system is reasonable or not, is another topic.

Stanley is an innocent little kid whose knowledge of Hell comes entirely from Saturday morning cartoons and the Monster's wildly inaccurate stories — so as soon as Stanley enters, Hell becomes cute, brightly-colored, and harmless, with the demons forced to behave as if they were stupid and easily-outwitted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">John Constantine clone</a> Ambrose Bierce explains this trope (but not to Stanley, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">it only works because Stanley doesn't know any better</a>).

</li></ul></li><li> This is the Hell shown in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> and its spinoff, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em> (though not everyone goes to Lucifer's particular Hell, so not everyone chooses their own damnation).
<ul><li> Lucifer states explicitly as much in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lucifer:</strong> "Ten billion years spent providing a place for dead mortals to torture themselves. And like all masochists, they called the shots — 'Burn me', 'Freeze me', 'Eat me', 'Hurt me'. And we did."
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Lucifer:</strong> "They live their own tiny lives. I do not live their lives for them. And then they die, and they come here (having transgressed against what they believed to be right), and expect us to fulfill their desire for pain and retributions. I don't make them come here."
</div></li><li> In <em>Death: At Death's Door</em>, several damned souls are people who <em>definitely</em> don't deserve to be in Hell, but are because they sincerely believe they deserve it. For example, one was a little boy who was beaten by his mother. While he was alive, during beatings, his mother said she hated him for being born because the pregnancy ruined her figure, so he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">naively thinks suffering in Hell will make her love him</a>.
</li><li> When Lucifer closes Hell and its inhabitants wander the Earth, a boy who encounters them notices that they seem to have brought their own hells with them. He even manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanicPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanicPrison">convince one of them to give it up and come with him.</a>
</li><li> Also, while Lucifer is closing Hell, he finds unique trouble in the last occupant, a guy who staked himself to a wall, refusing to leave because he needed to pay penance for the men, women, and children he slaughtered in life. Lucifer gets him to leave by saying no one remembers what he did centuries ago.
<div class="indent"><strong>Breschau of Livonia:</strong> I am Breschau of Livonia. I ripped out the tongues of those who spoke against me and cut the unborn babes from the wombs of my enemies women, that they would not become warriors to rise against me.

Soon my name was whispered in the night by mothers to terrify their babes into obedience, I am Breschau, who bathed in the blood of children. I am Breschau, who forced the true prophets of the lord to dance upon plates of hot iron, under which fires were burning, and I laughed as they danced.

For instance, suicide bombers go to Heaven and get 72 virgins, but all 72 are babies that they have to care for eternity. Also, the road to hell is literally paved with mimes, who go to hell regardless.

The realization that someone <em>cares</em> about them, even in the depths of Hell, exorcises the souls from the trees.

However, it's implied the <em>kind</em> of Heaven one experiences <em>is</em> based on their personal view of paradise, though they are capable of interacting freely with others.

The <em>biggest</em> point, however, is that ultimately it's surprisingly easy to escape Hell, but few ever figure it out.

So each day the first (or top) cells gorge themselves, the middle ones scrounge on leftovers, and the bottom ones are left with nothing and are driven to starvation, cannibalism or suicide. Here's the catch - every month prisoners are shuffled between cells. So those who'd left their prison-mates starve by refusing to ration food now suffer from the same injustice, those who'd spent time below and came to vehemently hate the selfish "abovers" relish their brief elevated (literally) position to stuff their faces and shit (some times literally) on the despised "belowers", and the vicious cycle continues.

They <em>insisted</em> on it!"
</li><li> There is an "inspirational story" about the idea of a self-inflicted hell. It goes as thus -
<div class="indent">A man spoke with the Lord about heaven and hell. The Lord said to the man, "Come, I will show you hell."
<p></p></div><div class="indent">They entered a room where a group of people sat around a huge pot of stew. Everyone was famished, desperate and starving. Each had a spoon strapped to their arm that reached the pot, but each spoon had a handle so much longer than their own arm that it could not be used to get the stew into their own mouths. The suffering was terrible.
<p></p></div><div class="indent">"Come, now I will show you heaven," the Lord said after a while. They entered another room, identical to the first — the pot of stew, the group of people, the same long-handled spoons. But there everyone was happy and well-nourished. "I don't understand," said the man. "Why are they happy here when they were miserable in the other room and everything was the same?"
<p></p></div><div class="indent">The Lord smiled, "Ah, it is simple," he said. "Here they have learned to feed each other."
</div><p></p><ul><li> There's also a version with chopsticks. Both the people in heaven and the people in hell are granted one chopstick. Those in hell are not charitable and do not trust those around them and so spend all their time trying to figure out how to eat with one and failing. Those in heaven are willing to share.
</li></ul></li><li> A whole subgenre of jokes among modern-day Pagans, where a Pagan dies and finds himself before Saint Peter, who promptly sends them along to the Summer Lands (the Neo-Pagan version of Heaven); along the way the Pagan meets Fundamentalists in some combination of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">Ironic Hell</a>.

St. Peter asks him, "What religion are you?" and the man answers. He is directed to a room but told to be quiet when passing by a particular other room. Several more people go through this. Finally, one person asks why they have to be quiet when passing by that particular room. St. Peter explains that "Well, you see, that's where [insert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableReligiousTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableReligiousTargets">Acceptable Religious Targets</a> here] are, and they think they're the only ones here.

</li><li> A man dies and goes to Heaven and it is great in every possible way. Later he inquires to take a peek at Hell. What he sees confuses him: it is the same thing as Heaven but everybody is absolutely miserable. He asks why. "They can't stop dwelling over how much better Heaven must be."

While Hell is a physical location, Satan escapes it pretty easily and pontificates the nature of his damnation. He acknowledges that he could seek forgiveness and receive it, but concludes that he is too prideful to submit to God again, so he will stay damned.

Why does he keep flapping his wings? Because he wants to return to Heaven. Where did the water of the frozen lake come from?

</li></ul><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> books exploit and subvert this concept in all kinds of ways, including (in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em>) a part-time barbarian qualifying for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Valhalla equivalent</a> because he sort of half-believed in his colleagues' beliefs and then started fully believing it just before he died, and a man who did not believe in ghosts being pursued through the afterlife by his victims because <em>they believe in him</em>.
<ul><li> Many who hit the afterlife are confronted with a long desert to cross; they are told by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper">Death</a> that their eternal reward is on the other side. This mentally stuns a few; they end up sitting in the sand, tormented. Unless they're golems, in which case they may consider standing around in the desert with no more duties to perform to <em>be</em> Heaven; when a particularly ancient golem is blown to pieces in <em>Going Postal</em>, having an absence of tasks was eternal reward enough.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em> Brutha the Prophet is the only one who sees the way out of the desert. When he dies and Death tells him judgment awaits him on the end of the desert, he says "Which end?" In response, Death grins.
</li><li> Discworld is actually almost a subversion of this trope. Since you only go to Hell if you really, deeply believe you <em>deserve</em> you go to Hell, Hell is mostly populated by rather nice people — because nobody who is genuinely, unapologetically evil (such as sociopaths) would believe that he deserves to be punished for all eternity. Although thankfully the torments of Hell are pretty harmless a lot of the time because people don't actually have to feel pain unless they're really trying to. Also, the demons are mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>.
<ul><li> It's also stated that because you must think you belong in hell to go there, you cannot go if you aren't even aware there is such a place. "This is why it's vitally important to shoot missionaries on sight."
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, nihilists (some of which can be genuinely evil) suffer greatly after death in <em>Discworld</em>, which does have real gods, pantheons, and afterlifes. If you don't believe anything, then you don't know where you belong after death, so you have to wait until you figure it out... and if you don't figure it out, then you'll be waiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">a very long time</a>...

It is unclear from the novel if this theory is always true; it is shown, however, that the afterlife does exist, but Woland ensures that one atheistic character gets exactly what he believed in: nothing. <br/><br/>The outcome may be based on deeds. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It is explicitly stated that Margarita gets her eternal peaceful being with Master away from everything for her love.

Despite Death explaining that his job is to take souls to Heaven or Hell (and suicide is a big sin...), the atheist doesn't believe in an afterlife. When he dies, Death tries to take his soul, but it disintegrates. Similarly, it's implied that the people who believe in one of the non-Abrahamic religions (such as Hinduism) end up in their religion's afterlife (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">or equivalent</a>); only people who believe that Hell <em>exists</em> can end up there, but what you believe you <em>deserve</em> has little or no effect on your afterlife.

So if you're Christian, you'll get heaven/hell/purgatory, if you're Hindu you'll get reincarnated. The Christian main character finds this out the hard way when he dies and goes to heaven but his wife is not there. So he assumes she's in hell, and only when he's trapped in Hell does anyone explain this to him. She's in Valhalla, and since he didn't believe in Valhalla, he can't get there.

This is seemingly inconsistent with the other games, however; in the original, for example, it's clearly Alessa's vision of Silent Hill that's imposed on everyone else there, while in <em>3</em>, the effect spreads beyond the original town, the source of the effect being Claudia. Except for <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, though, the other games all take place during occult summoning rituals, so the town's state in the second game could be interpreted as the way the town usually works during a "downtime" of no demonic summonings.
</li><li> According to the "Book of Lost Memories", an information book for the series, the appearance of the Otherworld in the first game caused the power of the town to increase, which is when it started calling to those who had darkness in their hearts.
