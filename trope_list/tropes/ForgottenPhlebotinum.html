Sometimes the power or device is remembered under circumstances where it proves mostly useless, but not remembered when it would do any good.
</p><p>This trope does not necessarily denote bad writing. It can be (as noted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">Order of the Stick</a></em> example) essential to the story. If the protagonists have some piece of phlebotinum that makes them nearly or actually invincible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap">many plots have to be thrown out the window.</a> Some would call this unwillingness to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">change the Status Quo</a> and then adapt to the new order of things "lazy", but when one is working on a regular series, changing the status quo, interesting though it can be dramatically, is not something to be done lightly. When it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> this is even more the case.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a> is scornful of this trope, and coined Niven's Law, which states that once a technology or discovery has been introduced into a fictional setting, it must continue to exist in all chronologically later stories in that setting. The secret may be lost for a variety of reasons  society enters a dark age, the discoverer deliberately covers it up, or there really were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">No Plans, No Prototype, No Backup</a>  but Niven would maintain that this smacks of lazy writing. At the very least, the precedent that such a machine is <em>physically possible</em> in the setting must be maintained, which would make it likely that older, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies">Higher-Tech Species</a> will possess it even if it never became prevalent in the protagonists' society.
</p><p>Note that this trope is for powers or devices that are forgotten in general. Something which the character does use a lot and only is forgotten this one time is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers">Forgot About His Powers</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em>: There are a few things that only come up in the spinoff once or twice before being discarded.
<ul><li> The Level Upper program, for example, is a noise file that increases a listener's power level before putting them in a coma, in which state they can be used as an organic computer for the controller of the network to make use of <em>all</em> their powers. Despite its obvious use to the more ruthless elements of Academy City, it has only been brought up again once, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when Gensei Kihara makes use of a small esper network during the Daihaseisai arc. The smaller size of Gensei's network also appears to avoid one of the bigger issues with the original, that is, the creation of the AIM Burst.</span>
</li><li> "Capacity Down" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Brown Note</a> in that causes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">immense physical and mental distress in espers, leading them to collapse and unable to use their powers</span>. This is used once in <em>Railgun</em> by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a non-esper villain against the esper heroes. Academy City has AIM Jammers that can similarly be used to supress espers, but they are limited to being static security measures for esper prisons and other important places, while Capacity Down's mobility advantage is never used beyond the arc that introduced it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, the crew seems to conveniently forget that they have a nigh-omnipotent hacker on board who could take over other ships at will in her initial appearance but never, ever does that again, even though that would not exactly be the least effective way to catch their bounties. It was particularly bad in the episode where the villains are immobilizing ships through a computer virus. Gee, if only they had someone on board who could counter that...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>, there were several instances in which Gomamon's Marching Fishes technique could have come in handy, especially since he was seen in the first episode carrying the entire group down a river on the fishes.
</li><li> This is not uncommon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em>. There are several predicaments that Doraemon and co. face that one of his gadgets that have been mentioned in previous episodes could have easily get them out but for some reason Doraemon seems to have to use the gadget that was introduced in episode they were in. One the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">gadgets of the week</a> (chapter 54, "Lies Become Truths") was a beak-like toy which one could wear, and anything uttered while using it will be spontaneously proven as fact. Nobita lied that his father can shatter a huge rock with his bare hand, and then he can do it with ease. Quite frankly this should have made any other gadget Doraemon had introduced, or will ever introduce, completely and utterly obsolete. It was never mentioned again ever since. Particularly frustrating in <em>Doraemon</em> feature films and volume-length comics, which featured life-threatening situations.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Dr. Marcoh reveals he has developed a way to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> destroy Philosopher's Stones, and uses it to great effect against Envy.</span> Yet Marcoh never uses it again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first two parts focused on protagonists using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheSun">the Ripple</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmySuperpower">a wide variety of ways</a> to fight vampires and similar creatures. From part three onward, the series focuses instead on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit">Stand</a>-based duels, no new Ripple users are introduced, and the one Ripple-user that's still around only uses its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">now-highly situational</a> vampire-slaying ability.
</li><li> Cyborgs were introduced in Part 2 and are rarely referenced afterward, save for two characters' mechanical hands. When one of those characters loses their legs, the idea of them ever being replaced with cybernetics is never brought up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: Often it was played straight. Many times Dr. Hell came up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Mechanical Beast</a> equipped with a weapon put Kouji or Mazinger-Z in a serious disadvantage: Gromazen R9 shot an acid could melt Aphrodite A's armor (that was made of Japanium, although it was less tough than Mazinger Z's), Kingdan X10 projected mirages, Holzon V3 set earthquakes off, Jinray S1 flew at Match 5, Aeros B2 could absorb Mazinger's attacks and hurling them back, Desma A1 caused hallucinations, Gumbina M5 was nearly invulnerable... and they were not used again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang">However, sometimes Dr. Hell reused and improved some strategies or weapons</a>, or deceived the enemy in believing he was using the same trick.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, the main Gundams all have shields with offensive capabilities. Wing Gundam's shield can be used as a stabbing weapon; Wing Zero has the same, except it actually extends to be more effective; Deathscythe (and its upgrade. Deathscythe Hell) has a Buster Shield, which opens up and produces a blade and is then launched at an enemy, Heavyarms' shield is integrated into its Beam Gatling; Sandrock's shield can be combined with its weapons and jetpack to create a superweapon and can be used as a blinding flare, and Shenlong can throw its shield to destroy a mobile suit. Yet other than the Heavyarms, these offensive capabilities were each used precisely once by the suit over the course of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheNightmareBeforeChristmasZerosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheNightmareBeforeChristmasZerosJourney">The Nightmare Before Christmas: Zero's Journey</a></em>, Lock, Shock, and Barrel don't bring their walking bathtub, despite that their ulterior motive to go to Christmas Town was to steal candy and toys while searching for Zero.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first episode Sailor Moon's hairclip things (on her odango/buns) can magically allow her to hear people in distress. This comes in handy, as she hears her best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">Naru</a> being attacked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> and goes to save her. This power is never shown again in later episodes, even though it would probably have come in handy. Similarly, in the first chapter of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a>, the costume included a mask in which she could see the monster attacking Naru by looking in the goggles. The goggles were quickly phased out in the manga, last seen in one transformation sequence where Usagi discarded them as she transformed, though why this happened was never explained. Considering that the monsters of the week/chapter were usually close by anyway, this power wasn't really that necessary in retrospect...
</li><li> Another forgotten ability was Sailor Moon's disguise pen. It was commonly used early in the series, but forgotten during R and appeared only once later off screen, to explain why Venus was disguised as Moon. This may have been due to the lack of need for Usagi to actually use her disguises in later storylines as she gathered a team of fellow heroes and many of these disguises often appeared superfluous to the plot anyway.
</li><li> Sailor Moon used a special attack, "Moon Tiara Stardust", in episode 5, to heal a group of transformed humans. She never used this again, despite it possibly being useful in many storylines, though she eventually acquired the Moon Stick which had the same abilities. This is likely because the former attack never showed up in the manga, while the latter item did.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em>: The Kero Ball and Angol Mois's Lucifer Spear gets used less and less each season. This gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">lampshaded</a> in the third movie - both items are lost at different points, but recovered from the wreckage during the end credits.
<ul><li> The 7th season of the anime attempted to reestablish the basic characters and setting of the show. As a result, both of these elements come to the forefront again. There are 3 episodes with the Keroball in the center of everything just in the first half of the season. That's more than in all of the first season!
<ul><li> The Lucifer Spear may be condemned to this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">after the earthquake of March 2011.</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>, we see that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> piloted by humans have head-mounted cannons - that got used exactly four times during the <em>entire show</em>. Only twice as a weapon - both of the other times they were used as <em>cutting tools</em>.
<ul><li> Thankfully, the head cannons see more consistent use in later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a></em> gives us the Hi-Coat Voltekka, an upgrade to Blade's Voltekka.

</li><li> And to round out the quartet, Yusuke masters his teacher's secret move, the ultimate fighting technique, the Spirit Wave. He successfully uses it for the first time to beat Jin, then never uses it in battle again. He does use it offscreen once, to heal himself, but considering he has such an incredibly versatile and powerful technique at his disposal, you'd think it would come in handy more often.

For example, there is <em>Action Comics</em> #252, an issue otherwise better known for being Supergirl's first appearance. In the lead-in story, though, Superman is being menaced by kryptonite, and he escapes by melting it with his heat vision, at which point he learns the liquid kryptonite is no longer harmful. (In a real head against wall moment, he even says that it's because when items change their state, they lose other properties, like how ice, when it melts into water, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">stops being cold</a>.

In Harry's defense, he was never told exactly what it was, and swore never to use it for fear it would cause Sirius to come to Hogwarts and get arrested and/or killed. It still qualifies as forgotten phlebotinum, however, because even after Harry has gone through great risk to speak to Sirius through Umbridge's fire, it didn't occur to Sirius to tell him "Next time, use the mirror I gave you." which would have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saved his life</span>.

<ul><li> Larry Niven formulated "Niven's Law" after realizing that the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Known Space</a>" series featured no less than three indestructible elements — the Slaver stasis field, General Products spaceship hulls, and "Ringworldium" — Ringworld flooring material. He correctly concluded that these boxed him in by eliminating many possible storylines.

After its introduction (and successful use) in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, it's largely ignored by the books (as well as later TV series). A short story in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNewFrontier">Star Trek: New Frontier</a></em> anthology eventually suggested the prototype was destroyed soon after the episode. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTheGenesisWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTheGenesisWave">Star Trek: The Genesis Wave</a></em>, the Romulans are making use of the technology again, or something very much like it, but then it drops off a second time, and when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTitan">Star Trek: Titan</a></em> comes round no-one's using it.

<ul><li> At least in <em>The Next Generation</em>, it was mentioned that the Federation had negotiated away its right to use cloaking technology in a treaty with the Romulans, making the Federations research into the phase-cloak illegal (i.e., a treaty violation that could lead to war with the Romulans). The episode showing the Romulans were working on it themselves showed that it was giving them trouble, and the illegal Federation project Riker had been a part of had not ended well either.

<ul><li> In an episode, Superman learns from a swami (or somesuch) how to divide himself into two by using the power of his Super-will. It was only used once. Each is only half as powerful as the full Superman so it makes sense for him not to use it all the time; but it would have come in very handy during all of those "you never see Clark and Superman at the same time" bits.
</li><li> Another episode has him develop the power to walk through walls <em>without</em> smashing through them by brute force and doing major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance">property damage</a>. Like the splitting power, gets forgotten from then on. (The same thing happens on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em> four decades later.)

The weapon proves exceptionally effective, allowing Ward to subdue the superpowered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Villain of the Week</a> without ever having to get close enough for the villain to use his powers against him. In fact, he never even realized Ward was there! Unfortunately, nobody ever seems to remember this when they need to non-lethally subdue threats in future episodes. While the I.C.E.R. itself becomes part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s regular arsenal, they're all handguns, which have considerably less range and leave the user much more vulnerable.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>, Wesley uses a flamethrower against a bunch of mooks. Despite fire being deadly to most things, <em>especially</em> vampires, this is never seen again. It would have been particularly useful when Los Angeles was being swarmed with vampires and there were too many for them to attack one at a time.

Now it's likely that Roslin is not the only one in the fleet with cancer (indeed, the season 4 episode "Faith" involves another character with terminal cancer). Yet no one even suggests the possibility of using Hera's blood to cure other cancer patients (or to try it on people with other kinds of terminal illnesses, for that matter). Even more ridiculous is when Roslin's cancer comes back in the season 3 finale, the question of using Hera's blood to cure her again is brought up only once (and ignored) by a reporter. This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">wasted plot potential</a>, since they could have done an episode about the ethics of regularly harvesting a baby's blood for medical purposes.
</li><li> The Blackbird fighter. Admittedly, they have to scrounge up a lot of supplies and spares to assemble it together but considering that Pegasus had Viper production facilities, it would not be impossible to construct additional stealth ships once the original was destroyed. It would have come in handy during New Caprica or the battle of The Hub.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> has a rare non-F&amp;SF example: Sheldon can be persuaded to do some things he finds ridiculous or inexplicable by telling him that the thing is a "<em>non-optional social convention</em>". Not only does it work, but he immediately accepts it without argument. This has been used a grand total of once in the show's history.

That doesn't stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> being used in later seasons, despite being less efficient.

<ul><li> Justified with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">Adjoining Spell</a> used to defeat the demon cyborg Adam. The following episode had the First Slayer try to kill everyone who used the spell in their dreams, explaining its absence from later seasons.
</li><li> One episode had the minion of the First Evil falsely claim he had kidnapped a Potential Slayer. Nobody thought of using the "detect a Potential" spell discovered a few episodes before.
</li><li> At the end of Season 5, Buffy uses a hammer that allows her to <em>pulverize</em> Glorificus, a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> that had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">shrugged off absolutely everything that was thrown at her before</a>. Said hammer is never seen or mentioned again, despite how useful it would have been against, say, the Turok-Han or Caleb.
</li><li> Similar to the flamethrower instance from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> mentioned above, in a Season 2 episode Buffy kills a random mook vampire by shoving a burning torch/brazier against its chest, which causes it to go up in flames like it was made of straw soaked in gasoline. Given how the series occasionally spiced up vampire-killing up with decapitation or holy water, it's a small wonder fire didn't come up more.
</li><li> Anya's power center necklace. When she turned demon again, it seemed she never needed it. You'd think, when Buffy decided she had no choice but to kill Anya to keep her from massacring more fraternities, someone might have pointed out that turning Anya back into a human would have limited her carnage potential.
</li><li> A mundane technology version is the rocket launcher used against the Judge. Buffy is shown to have it as far on as Season 7, but she also never uses it against Caleb or his minions.
</li></ul></li><li> The spirit board from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed (1998)</a></em>, which was used for all of three episodes before disappearing in season three until it finally resurfaced for one last use in season 8.

<ul><li> The TARDIS has had many features used over the decades that were completely forgotten soon afterwards: it can drift back to its owner if separated from them in time (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E5RevengeOfTheCybermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E5RevengeOfTheCybermen">"Revenge of the Cybermen"</a>), it has a Space-Time Visualiser (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E7TheSpaceMuseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E7TheSpaceMuseum">"The Space Museum"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E8TheChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E8TheChase">"The Chase"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E6TheMoonbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E6TheMoonbase">"The Moonbase"</a>), a Hostile Action Displacement System (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E4TheKrotons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E4TheKrotons">"The Krotons"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E8ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E8ColdWar">"Cold War"</a>) and other features. Considering that the TARDIS was a museum piece even before the Doctor stole it over a millennium ago and is highly temperamental even at the best of times, it's entirely probable that these things literally don't work anymore.
<ul><li> Companions sometimes call the Doctor out on this in relation to the TARDIS. But it's conveniently stolen, missing, or can't be used due to the danger of crossing their own timestreams, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">apparently</a> very bad.

The Eleventh Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E8LetsKillHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E8LetsKillHitler">later admitted</a> that it was a "clever lie".

<ul><li> Zhaan is capable of camouflaging herself like a chameleon, but only uses this ability in one episode ("Bone to be Wild", Season 1). She is a plant and this <em>is</em> one of the few times she is in a forest, but one would think it would be <em>harder</em> for her to camouflage herself against something as complex as foliage, compared to the relatively uniform interior of <em>Moya</em>.
</li><li> D'Argo's super-long tongue and anesthetic saliva gets forgotten every fifth episode or so. His arms and legs are bound, while a sole villain gloats nearby without a helmet, whatever shall he do? The funniest is when John asks him to knock him out in "A Prefect Murder", and D'Argo pistol whips him. And it doesn't work. John asks him to hit him again harder.
</li><li> In the 8th episode "They've Got A Secret", the living ship Moya decides that her passengers pose a threat to her unborn baby. Using just one D.R.D. (a little robotic repair drone), Moya proceeds to glue Aeryn Sun to the deck - instantly neutralizing her in a non-lethal manner. In the following 80 episodes and the two hour mini-series, not one of the crew ever thinks of using this same tactic on the endless stream of hostile and dangerous beings that board the ship despite the fact that they have hundreds of D.R.D.s at their command.

It works on <em>anything</em>, and nobody even <em>mentions</em> it in situations where it might be useful (for instance, on Nathan at the end of season 3). Her blood had previously restored her adoptive father to life. A shame he didn't mention this when her biological father needed it, and her grandmother was frantic to preserve him. Even stupider, her grandmother should have already known about it because of Adam.
</li><li> Every once in awhile this will happen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> due to the Heisei Series being more toyetic.

Aside from the common stunts, Bonnie/April would mention off-the-cuff that they'd added some cool new feature to KITT... which just happened to be exceedingly useful for that episode's problem. Then, it would never be heard about again despite the gadget being a solution to a later problem. Only a very few added features went on to be regularly featured without being implied to have always been there (which invoked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">reverse of this trope</a>, why hadn't they been using it?) A few gadgets were explicitly mentioned as being failures and being removed in order to avoid this trope when they were a little <em>too</em> powerful, such as the laser and device that let KITT drive on water.

It's implied or explicitly stated that she's done this many times, yet she has to send Snow White into the woods with the Woodsman to get him to cut her heart out mundanely, rather than doing the job herself and turning her hated step-daughter into a slave and puppet ruler.
<ul><li> Moreover the Evil Queen's magic mirror is able to locate Snow White anywhere at any time as shown in multiple episodes (such as <em>True North</em>, <em>Ariel</em> and <em>Souls of the Departed</em>), yet there are a few instances where Regina is desperately looking for Snow White; in <em>Page 23</em> Regina needs a special item (an arrow of Cupid's to find her) and in <em>The Evil Queen</em> she kills an entire village because its inhabitants refuse to tell Regina Snow White's whereabouts.

She is significantly less in control of things once the magic is revealed, and she's the new kid on the block trying to figure everything out.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ever since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> took over the franchise, teams have been getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperpowers">single special abilities</a> while untransformed. Except in <em>Ninja Storm</em> and <em>Jungle Fury</em>, where these powers were highly plot important, the Rangers would generally completely forget they had these powers for a dozen episodes at a time.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em>, this happened far more frequently, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffins</a> being introduced regularly and never being mentioned again. The worst was the Sword of Power, summoned by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">brainwashed</a> Tommy as part of a ploy by Lord Zedd to steal it. After regaining his mind, Tommy goes to great lengths to get it back, taking on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> single-handedly. He retrieves it... and it's never seen again. For that matter, it wasn't clear why it was so desirable in the first place. Honorable mention also goes to the Thunder Slingers. Tommy and Jason spend an entire episode working together to get them, and then after one battle they're never used again.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a> nature of the franchise causes a few instances of this in the first few series. Notably, both the Zeo Crystal and the Zeo Zord fleet from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Power Rangers Zeo</a></em> survived the end of that particular show, but nobody ever thinks to use these again after the Rangers lose their Turbo powers and Zords at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> is a major offender. By the end of the seventh season, the crew had access to, among other things: An inter-dimensional transporter, a virus which brings dreams to life, a portal leading to Red Dwarf, pre-radiation incident, a batch of developing fluid which allows one to enter any photo and alter time from that point, a matter transporting paddle, a DNA reconstituter, a triplicator, a virus which bestows incredible luck, and nanomachines which seem to be able to create almost anything (up to and including <em>planets and sentient life forms</em>). None of these items are ever used or even referenced more than once (Except the luck virus, which becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang">Chekhov's Boomerang</a> in Season 8). But worst of all, in a show where the entire plot conceit is a crew stranded in deep space, trying to get home, the Dwarfers find a <em>fully functional time drive</em> which allows them to travel anywhere in the universe, at any point in time. And yes, they can and do use it to go to Earth. More than once. Somehow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan">this doesn't end the show</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> usually avoids this, with plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang">Chekhovs Boomerangs</a> shown <em>years</em> apart, but it still has its examples.
<ul><li> Kull Warrior Armor. That stuff shrugs off <em>claymore</em> explosions, and is light enough to wear, yet while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar">Vala</a> is able to get her hands on a suit and capture a <em>starship</em> — a <em>United States</em> starship, no less, so you'd think they learn — with it, the US military doesn't even seem <em>interested</em> in it. Plus it looks <em>really</em> badass.
</li><li> Season 3, "Past and Present": They discover a drug that reverses the effects of aging. Next episode, it's forgotten.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>:
<ul><li> By the end of the series, Atlantis is on Earth. Atlantis. The Ancient city-ship with sensors that are capable of picking up even cloaked ships in practically one third of the galaxy away from wherever it happens to be. The database of which contains truly obscene amounts of information on Ancient technology. And yet not only do they barely touch on the database in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> (no sending a scientist back to, say, research useful ways to get help), but the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucian Alliance can somehow sneak past it</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Atlantis had a fail-safe that required it be returned to the Pegasus Galaxy a few weeks later (this was to have been the plot of the <em>Atlantis</em> movie had it been greenlit), which addresses only some of these omissions.
</li><li> Justified with the Aterro device, an Ancient superweapon that destroys Wraith ships when they jump to hyperspace, but also causes Stargates to explode when dialed. While the Avenger Program from SG-1 <em>could</em> have crippled the gate network and allowed the device to work safely for brief periods to help end the war with the Wraith, by the time that the Atlantis team figured out what had happened, Todd had already hijacked the <em>Daedalus</em> and set a course to destroy the device.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> The movies introduce the Genesis device (a form of instant terraforming that may bring people back to life as a side effect), which is so much further advanced than anything the Federation possesses before or since that it might as well be magic. The planet it creates disintegrates within a couple weeks, but surely there would be a way to work the kinks out within the next century, and the research that went into it could at least be applied to other projects, like a handy-dandy anti-Borg weapon. But in <em>The Next Generation</em> and <em>Deep Space Nine</em> terraforming is a long and arduous process that yields modest results. Ultimately it's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">No Plans, No Prototype, No Backup</a>; every copy of the schematics is lost and everyone who knows how to make it is dead. Given that the Klingons considered it a treaty-violating potential planet-killing superweapon, there was probably political pressure not to rebuild it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> was notorious for this.
<ul><li> In "Plato's Stepchildren", the Enterprise crew discovers kironide, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesoptinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesoptinum">drug that gives people telekinetic powers</a>. Why wasn't this made a standard part of the medical kit, even if it is too dangerous to use all the time?
</li><li> The subcutaneous transponder ("Patterns of Force"), which gave the ship the ability to lock onto and beam up the landing party if they were out of contact. Its actual purpose in the plot was to give Kirk and Spock a Cool Escape, rather than pull the whole trick-the-one-inept-guard bit again. Despite the number of times they were separated from their communicators, the thing was never seen before or since. You'd think it would be standard issue.
</li><li> Scalosian water ("Wink of an Eye") gives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> (though with a serious risk of dying from injuries that would normally be trivially minor).
</li><li> Spores that can regenerate lost body parts, restore the human body to perfect health and give immunity to radiation ("This Side of Paradise").
</li><li> The episode "The Return of Archons" shows that hand phasers have a wide-beam stun setting that can stun a roomful of people all at once. It shoots a flat beam arc at least ninety degrees wide and has a range of at least twenty meters. Despite the obvious usefulness of such a feature, it is used again exactly <em>once</em> in an episode of <em>Voyager</em>.
</li><li> "A Piece of the Action" showed the ship's phasers could stun people on the ground and could even exclude the building in the middle of the stun area. Never seen again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> indulged in this far too often.
<ul><li> Consider the "dimensional inverter" used in the episode "The High Ground", that could transport things straight through even a Galaxy-class starship's shields (or any other shields) without trouble, but had a cumulative and lethal side effect on people who used it repeatedly. And while that's obviously a sane reason not to use it in normal service, it does <em>nothing</em> to explain why they didn't use it for, oh, one-way trips by inanimate objects straight through enemy starship shields... objects like armed anti-matter warheads, for example. (Or as a Plan B for when crew members are in danger on the planet but can't be beamed up due to an attack on the ship that requires them to keep their shields up or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> that blocks the beam).
</li><li> The episode "Lonely Among Us" shows how the transporter could <em>bring the dead back to life!</em> While the person's consciousness had been converted into energy by the being that had possessed him, the episode seems to imply that they can always re-materialize a previously saved version of a crew member.
</li><li> The Galaxy class has Saucer Separation capability because the Saucer section contains the civilians, laboratories, families, etc., while the lower section contains the warp drive and primary weapon systems. It allows the civilians to be moved out of harm's way if the ship has to go into a firefight. Saucer separation was used twice in the first season of the show, and once in the season 4 premiere, but after that it was forgotten and only sometimes referred to, just to drop the idea afterwards (it was, however, used in one of the movies). The <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual</em> explains in a footnote that the writers never forgot about the Saucer Separation capability, and originally intended to use it as a fairly standard maneuver whenever the ship expected to go into trouble. However, what they discovered is that depicting the separation on screen and showing crew moving to the other set just took too much time during the episode to show fully, and not doing so was too jarring of a sudden transition. Hence, they used it sparingly (if at all) for pacing reasons. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1glmg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1glmg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1glmg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Plus, without the saucer component the stardrive section looks very silly.</span>
</li><li> "Hero Worship" has Geordi connecting the shields to the warp drive, more than doubling their strength. Never mind the other hundred times when this would have been useful.
</li><li> The transporters were remembered. The shuttles were (usually) remembered. What was <em>not</em> usually remembered was that the shuttles have independent transporter units of their own, separate from the ship's (they didn't in <em>TOS</em>, but <em>TNG</em> established it).
</li><li> "Who Watches the Watchers" has Troi and Riker implanted with subcutaneous communicators, allowing two-way communication between themselves and the <em>Enterprise</em>, which only the ground team can hear. Naturally, this technology was only ever used <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum">four</a></em> more times over the course of the entire franchise, despite existing as early as the 22nd Century according to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS6E7Rascals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS6E7Rascals">Rascals</a>", a transporter accident turns some crew members into young children. To be sure, this was inconvenient at the time, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">staggering medical implications</a> are never explored. The entire plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">Star Trek: Insurrection</a></em> need never have happened if they'd just figured out how to zap people back to their twenties every time they got north of, say, fifty. Considering that they were able to reverse-engineer the accident well enough to return the crew members to their original age in the space of one episode, perfecting the treatment shouldn't have been too difficult.
</li><li> An episode had Dr. Pulaski get a mutated virus that aged her. They used a stray hair from her brush and a transporter to restore her to a condition before she contracted the illness. In other words, if you keep a healthy DNA sample, you can restore someone to any age and cure any disease.
</li><li> Using two beams due to interference led to the creation of a second Will Riker, completely by accident. Both were physically identical and had the same memories up until that point. Not only is it capable of cloning a person despite there being no additional mass, but there's the question of who is actually materialized, the original person or a copy?
</li><li> How about Dr. Soong's having spent decades trying to hook Data up with a positronic brain capable of sentient thought, while Geordi did the same thing with one poorly-worded request in the holodeck? Oh, they <em>tell</em> Moriarty that they'll look into how and why it happened so they can try to figure out a way to let him leave the holodeck... and then promptly forget all about it until he shows up again seasons later. He's understandably unhappy about it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2978g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2978g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2978g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Seeing as sapient holograms are in service <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">just a few years later</a>, it looks like someone did look into it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">And they're given about as many legal rights as a wad of used Kleenex.</a></span>

Despite being hugely effective and friendly (one of them performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save the heroes), they're never mentioned again.

<ul><li> They came up with a holographic communications array, installed it on the <em>Defiant</em>'s bridge and Sisko's office, used it all of three times and forgot all about it. Other than looking cool and saving some money on blue-screen usage, it really served no purpose at all.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ydgn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ydgn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ydgn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was eventually retconned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> as having existed even before TOS days. It was removed from the <em>Enterprise</em> both because it interfered with her older systems and because Pike just plain didn't like how it made everyone look like ghosts. It's possible the rest of Starfleet soon gave up on the tech and went back to the good old screens.</span>
</li><li> The easily replicable TR-116 rifle, a projectile weapon capable of shooting through walls thanks to a recent modification the episode's villain had made to it (a combination of x-ray goggles and micro-transporter).
</li><li> Traditional military equipment in general, for everyone, during a major galactic war. Everyone uses very slow firing energy weapons that require being charged. No-one has squad level machine gun style weaponry, no-one uses grenades or explosives, the force fields that everyone has on their ships aren't modified for mobile local use in combat, and most of the military forces are only equipped an energy rifle or pistol, perhaps a handheld scanner and if you are Klingon, a bladed melee weapon. The military forces on all sides are generally lacking any form of armour or personal equipment that a soldier or sailor in modern times would carry, they don't wear helmets in combat to protect themselves from falling debris or shrapnel and rarely take any obvious food &amp; water with themselves.
</li><li> There is an entire episode based around a Starfleet unit trapped on a planetary facility being attacked by Jem'Hadar infantry. The Starfleet unit is equipped with nothing but small arms and the Jem'Hadar have no artillery or air support and thus have to make frontal assaults on a fixed position. The episode does reveals that the Jem'Hadar do one trick up their sleeve. Cloaked anti-personnel mines, which are literally all over the Federation base. Which begs the question of why don't they just program the mines to kill everyone in the base by going off at the same time? Those mines also don't show up at any other point, when they would be extremely useful as a hidden surprise upon having to relocate.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, the crew conveniently forgot several gadgets that could have gotten them home, or at least closer to it:
<ul><li> Q Jr, depowered, retains enough Q knowledge to use the Delta Flyer's [insert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a> here] to create portals, without any unpleasant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrekShake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrekShake">Star Trek Shake</a>-inducing side-effects that we saw. The crew could have done whatever it was that he did and gotten home via a series of portals, or at least - as was often the case with <em>Voyager</em>'s non-deadly shortcuts - shaved a decade or two off their trip before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> gave out.
</li><li> In "Threshold", where the otherwise successful test of an experimental transwarp engine turns Janeway and Paris into newts. An imposing side-effect, to be sure, but one which they have cured by episode's end, leaving them in possession of a magic new transportation technology which could get them back to Earth almost immediately, <strong>and</strong> a cure for its inevitable side-effect. So rather than using it to return to Earth, or even send a <em>message</em> back to the Federation (this was before the Federation discovered that <em>Voyager</em> and her crew had survived), they roll end credits and never mention it again. Even ignoring the lizard-fication, "Threshold" mentions that the experimental shuttle's computers were jam-packed with detailed and helpful navigation aids and maps for the entire sector—which are never mentioned again.
</li><li> In one episode Seven of Nine designs Borg-tech shield enhancements, which appear on the outer hull in standard Borg green. These useful modifications vanish after this episode, never to be seen again.
</li><li> Seven of Nine once brought Neelix back from the freakin' dead after <em>several hours</em> via (what else?) nanoprobes. Apparently, the technology must only work on main cast members. Only that one time...
</li><li> Throughout the series, Voyager manages to cut a collective <em>30-50 years</em> off their journey. As the (non-altered) future of the series finale "Endgame" shows, after the crew ignored the Borg temporal node, they supposedly spent the next <strong>26 years</strong> merrily skipping along on their way to Earth <em>without</em> the aid of any of the aforementioned technologies. It's like the crew just gave up and decided to go the traditional way, even though Janeway wouldn't have hesitated to use an advantage if one presented itself.
</li><li> The show gives a reason ship-board transporters won't work, but they neglect to explain why they can't use the shuttle's independently-powered transporters.
</li><li> Several Borg-focused episodes had them assimilating low-tech worlds just to swell their numbers. What makes it this trope is that cloning technology has been frequently shown in the franchise to be widespread and very cheap (to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS01E04AManAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS01E04AManAlone">petty criminals from low-tech worlds used it to fake their death</a>); if all they need is bodies they can just make some.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>
<ul><li> The Colt. Sam and Dean spend the first part of season 5 trying to recover it, only to discover that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it doesn't work on Lucifer</span>. They never use it again, despite how it would still work on lots of the other things they fight (Lucifer says he's one of only four beings in existence it can't kill, Michael and God presumably among them). They do use it when they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">travel back in time</a> to kill a phoenix in season 6, though, so it's not <em>completely</em> forgotten. Forgetting it is justified in at least some cases since there are knives that can kill angels and demons as well, but what about the Leviathans?
</li><li> In "Holy Terror", Sam is possessed by an angel, and Dean needs a way to get it out. Kevin comes up with a ritual that will temporarily give Sam control, allowing him to expel the angel. This doesn't work, but not due to any problem with the spell -The angel merely found out about it beforehand and sabotaged the ritual. One episode later, in "Road Trip", Dean and Castiel capture the angel, still in Sam's body, and need a way to expel him. The only idea they can come up with is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">deal with Crowley</a>, that he enters Sam's mind and explains the situation to him in exchange for his own freedom.

This can be attributed to the set designers not coming up with combinations for the later sets, though a couple of already existing combinations still didn't get to be used, even when they would have come in really handy. There is no in-story explanation for this: the writer simply doesn't want to use them.
<ul><li> Another seemingly forgotten "power" is the ability for a character to rebuild itself (since they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuiltWithLego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuiltWithLego">Built with LEGO</a>). Granted, this ability apparently requires the character to have an amount of secret knowledge, have pieces lying around and having strong enough muscles to support a new body, but still... the ability <em>exists</em> and <em>has</em> been used to make the characters stronger, but only on one occasion (because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">the toys said so</a>).
</li><li> Franchise co-creator Bob Thompson was fond of kooky ideas like having an oddball character called Kapura travel super fast by moving super slow. Since none of the other writers understood this ability, it was never utilized beyond a game mechanic in a 2001 online game.

In episode 20 "The Wings of Fear" he develops "Solar Energy Storage Bands", which provide him with solar energy to replenish his powers when he's out of the sunlight. After this episode they're never mentioned again, even though they would have been incredibly useful.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> episode "Beauty and the Bogbeast", a magical river was introduced. At a particular time every year, it could take the heroes anywhere they wanted to go - Earth included. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Naturally, they are forced to turn around</a>, at the last minute, due to extenuating circumstances. They never seem to consider that there's nothing stopping them from coming back (it's not clear how long the series takes place over, but it can't be that much less) next year and making sure no one gets turned into a bogbeast this time. Even considering the source, if there was ever an episode to throw on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDisContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDisContinuity">Fanon Dis Continuity</a> pile <em>anyway</em>...
<ul><li> The episode "In Search Of the Dungeon Master" introduces a "Know Tree," a talking tree who claims to know "everything there is to know," including how to get the kids home. However, when Dungeon Master is kidnapped, the tree instantly becomes aware of it and gets so spooked that he clams up and stops talking. Still, we never see the kids return to try asking him <em>again,</em> once things have calmed down. Heck, it's implied that he isn't even the only Know Tree around.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>.
<ul><li> Sometimes Timmy Turner wishes for superpowers. Sometimes he doesn't unwish them. These actually show up later and affect the plot. Same with magical items, handwaved by saying that they were neglected or that Cosmo was screwing with them.
</li><li> In one episode, Timmy discovers that mixing Cosmo's sweat into lemonade results in a drink that grants rule free wishes. You'd think after Cosmo had a chance to rest (he was run dry making it) he's use it to solve more problems, but it never comes up.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, Richard Nixon's head uses a robot body in one episode, and Beck's head controls a small set of robot arms in another. If heads in jars can control robot bodies, why don't most of them do it?
<ul><li> The day Nixon was elected, he got himself a gargantuan robot body complete with integrated rocket launchers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">Where did it go?</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero">G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero</a></em> was particularly bad about this. C.O.B.R.A. would develop a new superweapon, and the new superweapon would be destroyed by the G.I. Joe team. Just imagine if C.O.B.R.A. were to use more than one of the same weapon at the same time, or if it were to use several different superweapons at the same time.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> the Rainbow of Light was the ponies' best weapon and said to be one of the most powerful magic artifacts in Ponyland. The number of times it was used can be counted on one hand; against Tirek, against Catrina, against the Witches of the Volcano of Gloom and the Smooze, and to clear away rain clouds so they could pick cherries. After that, it was never seen nor mentioned again, save for once when Megan remembered they had it and planned to use it, only to drop it where she couldn't get it back and had it returned to her after the threat had been defeated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>: Season 1 is full of this. The Elements of Harmony (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">and Princess Luna</a>) are completely forgotten about after the second episode, Twilight Sparkle never teleported after episode four, Pinkie's "Pinkie Sense" is never mentioned again, and while the Sonic Rainboom pops up later it is only in a series of flashbacks. Season two turned <em>all</em> of these and more into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang">Chekhovs Boomerangs</a>... for, in most cases, exactly one episode each, after which they all went back to being forgotten if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Rule of Drama</a> requires it. By the end of season 2 the teleport spell was casual use. Some of these were due to an instruction from Hasbro to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout">Continuity Lockout</a>, since they wanted to be able to broadcast and syndicate the episodes in any order. That doesn't explain late-Season-1-Twilight's aversion to teleportation, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Season 2 episode "Simpson and Delilah" reveals a new drug, Dimoxinil, which is shown to immediately cure baldness and grow a thick mane of hair just overnight. Homer uses it, becomes promoted and heavily respected at work, but loses the hair and his respect after Bart accidentally spills the Dimoxinil. After this episode, it is never seen or mentioned again, despite the fact that such a product would change the medical landscape due to actually curing all baldness. Homer is seen caring about his baldness in future episodes, despite the fact that baldness should be a thing of the past in that universe now. It was supposed to have been lost to Homer because of its expense ($1000 for a 6 month supply, which Homer almost got in trouble for paying with his insurance), but given how immediately it improved his career, you'd think he'd invest in more (especially when later episodes show him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsRedInk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsRedInk">wasting larger amount of money on less useful things</a>).
</li><li> The Season 3 episode "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?" saw Homer's half-brother Herbert invent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">a device</a> that translated baby-talk into intelligible English phrases. During the episode, this actually allows Maggie to stop being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless">the voiceless</a> and actually interact with the rest of the cast. The device is never mentioned again, which is surprising from a show that frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> its own reliance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>.
</li><li> Season 6's "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" had Grandpa Simpson make a aphrodisiac tonic which helps Homer and Marge's sex-life, which they start selling to the rest of Springfield. That tonic sure would've helped in later episodes where Homer and Marge's sex-life was struggling, e.g. season 9's "Natural Born Kissers".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast">Space Ghost Coast to Coast</a></em>. The episode "Snatch" has a segment that is pseudo-satirical of this trope. Although the device in that case is a mind erasing device, so at least it is feasible that the device is never remembered.
</li><li> A major problem with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a></em> being considered canon is that the enormously useful life support belts never appear in any later Trek works. The belt surrounded the wearer with a glowing forcefield within which breathable air was provided. The real reason was that it was cheaper to animate a glowing outline than it was to draw spacesuits on everyone.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrokerAndHoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrokerAndHoop">Stroker and Hoop</a></em> with Hoop learning ninja skills for plot-related reasons in one episode, but never using them again. It's then brought up in another episode. Turns out you have to actually continue practicing to maintain ninja skills. Who knew?
</li><li> <em>Challenge of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em> is notorious for this trope.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">invents</a> teleporters, time machines, cloaking devices, a gizmo that sucks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing">Green Lantern Ring</a> off its wearer's finger, etc., etc. ... uses them once ... and then then never uses them again, even in situations where one of them would save the Legion of Doom's bacon.
</li><li> One particularly damning example has Luthor forget a piece of Phlebotinum only moments after acquiring it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight">When he time travels to alter several of the Super Friends' origins</a>, Luthor switches places with Hal Jordan and becomes the recipient of Abin Sur's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> ring. He dons his own Green Lantern suit and uses the ring to fly back to the Hall of Doom, and then promptly puts his purple jump suit back on and makes no other attempt to use the ring. This after having been defeated by Green Lantern's power too many times to count! (On the other hand he's on a team with an ex-Green Lantern who got busted abusing his powers. Maybe he's playing it safe.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em>: In the <em>Fast Forward</em> season, the Turtles and Splinter are stranded a hundred years in the future with no way of returning to their own time... not one mention is made of their time-traveling friend Renet, who is supposed to keep an eye on the time stream and would almost certainly have noticed if the Turtles were suddenly in a different time period than they were supposed to. Then again, it could be the Turtles and Splinter <em>were</em> supposed to spend some time in the future.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>
<ul><li> Waspinator's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> that he shoots at Cheetor with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> pilot. He never uses them again in combat, even in the Season 2 opener, when Cheetor knocks his gun out of his hand and those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> would have been a nice alternative to running away. He did use them at one other time, when he and Terrorsaur (who was also using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>) were trying to cut into Tigatron's stasis pod, but as a general rule if a character on the show had that ability and wasn't named Dinobot, they only got used on very rare occasions, and got overlooked numerous times that they could have been helpful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em> had both sides constantly creating weapons that would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> in the hands of non-idiots. Instead of being used for what they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisappliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisappliedPhlebotinum">could be</a>, they'd be used to create/stop the problem of the day, and then never be seen or heard from again. Also, the many, many, <strong>many</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">one-shot powers displayed by individual Autobots</a> that would never be used again. (Most iconically, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy">Pure Energy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail">flail</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">axe</a> used by Megs and Prime, respectively, in the series premiere only and never again.) They also suffered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">No Plans, No Prototype, No Backup</a>: If the ultimate weapon whipped up in the days since the previous episode gets smashed at the end, just making another is apparently never an option.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>:
<ul><li> A segment of a season 3 episode opens with Icy boasting about a new fire power Valtor gave her. In the Trix's battles against the Winx, including the one just a few minutes later, she doesn't use it (and in fact, it's <em>Darcy</em> who sets a library on fire in a later episode, not Icy). And during the battle in the same episode, Layla sneaks up behind Darcy and Stormy to tie them up, even though way back in the second ever episode, she sensed Bloom's presence behind a garbage can, even though Bloom was well out of her view. (However, the non-4K version does mitigate the stupidity in both cases somewhat.)
</li><li> A season 1 episode saw Icy destroy Red Fountain by freezing it with a nifty ice dragon. Season finale, Icy doesn't even make any effort to use it to freeze Alfea, or to take on Bloom, who has an fire-energy dragon of her own.
</li><li> Bloom was shown to be able to use her powers to revive the dead. It's not explained why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nabu</span> is still dead. This was changed to breaking a sleeping spell in the 4kids version, which removes the contention entirely.
</li><li> In early season 3 there's nothing stopping a blind Layla from waiting to use Queen Ligea's healing staff the next sunset after she uses it on its owner.
</li><li> The Charmix from season 2. Sure, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a>, but there's nothing else preventing the fairies who hadn't earned their Enchantix from using it in season 3, especially like when they're battling the Trix. Yet the only time it's even mentioned in season 3 is when the school headmistress talks about Enchantix.
</li><li> In the 21st episode of the third season, Nabu claimed that the reason he had stowed away on the Specialists ship was so he could practice his invisibility spells against monsters living in the area the Winx were travelling to. Nabu's ability to turn invisible hasn't been seen again since this episode. (Although it's possible that he used this ability off-screen during season 4's episode 20 when he went to the nature fairy Diana's castle to try to save the Specialists, but this is just a theory...)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>
<ul><li> The Shard of Lightning can freeze time, and Jack used it to steal most of the monks' Shen Gong Wu, and cause various havoc. The monks won it by the end of the episode, but never use it again.
</li><li> The Golden Tiger Claws, which allow a person to create a portal to <em>any</em> location. It's introduced and done away with in Season 1, but returned to the heroes in Season 2. Despite that Dojo can sense the location of any newly active Wu, the heroes never decide to have Dojo use the Claws to warp there, instead of flying there slowly enough to let the villains reach the Wu.
</li><li> The Emperor Scorpion, a Shen Gong Wu that can control <em>any</em> other Shen Gong Wu. After being used to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">defeat four Mala Mala Jongs (giant demons made of Shen Gong Wu) at once</span>, it is sealed away in the vault. Neither the monks, nor the villains (who raid the vault every six episodes or so) ever take or use this supreme Shen Gong Wu ever again, presumably because it would make the show very boring.
</li><li> In "The Black Vipers", Jack is seen flying away after being deceived into losing a bag full of Shen Gong Wu. You can see the Glove of Jisaku on his hand as he flies away. The Glove of Jisaku has the power to attract other objects - even other Shen Gong Wu. He even used it to steal a bunch of Wu at once in an earlier episode. Yet he doesn't use it here.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There are some inventions and compounds from the ancient times that we know that existed, but we can't replicate, even with modern techonogy, either because recipe or plans were lost over time, or because the required resources are used up. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8u1RJ7obFk">This video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows seven of them: heat-ray weapon made by Archimedes, Roman concrete, Silphium, Uunartoq discs (or Viking compasses), flexible glass, Damascus steel and Greek fire.
<ul><li> The problem for several of them is we know <em>several</em> ways to reproduce it, the question is which (if any) they actually used. For instance, Greek fire is described so many different ways in different sources that a leading theory is that it was a general term for incendiary weapons, not a single recipe.
</li></ul></li><li> The mortar used for the Great Wall of China - which has lasted for hundreds of years - also used to fall into this trope <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until recently, when scientists discovered that the secret was...sticky rice!</span>
