</div></div><p>An old trope, wherein enough belief in something will cause things to happen. Also known as the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PeterPan">Tinkerbell</a> effect", which is itself a subcategory of what is known as "magical thinking", a belief in cause-and-effect relationships between uncorrelated events based on coincidences. This trope isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather">Magic Feather</a> where "confidence" merely allows one to use one's own abilities to the fullest; this physically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">changes the Universe</a>. Many fantasy universes include some form of this: things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">love</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate">hate</a> may be physically manifest forces rather than only things that exist in people's minds. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernism">post-modern take</a> on divine pantheons posits that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">gods are the product of (or severely dependent upon) their believers</a>  take away their believers, and a god "fades away".
When turned up to a global or universal scale, this can result in a "consensus reality"  a world completely created by what people think rather than its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalInertia">Ontological Inertia</a>.

</p><p>A variant of this trope, common in works aimed at children (and their parodies) involves one character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">turning to the audience and asking them</a> to clap their hands/stomp their feet/whatever to accomplish whatever needs to be accomplished at the time.

</li></ul></li><li> Devils in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChainsawMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChainsawMan">Chainsaw Man</a></em> have a variant on this trope, namely that each devil is created out of human fear of something, and the more feared that something is, the more powerful they are. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Starter Villain</a> is the Zombie Devil, for instance, who, while being fairly threatening to normal people, pales compared to most other devils seen throughout the series because people know zombies aren't real and thus aren't too scared of them. On the other hand, everyone fears having a gun pointed at them, and to that extent, the Gun Devil is so strong, it has a kill rate of thousands of people <em>per second</em> simply by existing.
</li><li> The part where the trope crosses over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus">I Am Spartacus</a> is the principle behind Goku's Genki-dama/Spirit Bomb in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: he draws energy from the Earth, including its people, to power it up.

Hyde explains that the source of all magical power is belief; the point of the strange rituals is to convince the spellcaster of the spell's reality.
</li><li> This was bound to show up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KamigamiNoAsobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KamigamiNoAsobi">Kamigami no Asobi</a></em>, the show with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre">harem</a> of gods.

Back when Kobayashi and Tohru first met, Tohru had been impaled by a holy sword that would break the mind of any mortal that touched it. Being from Earth, Kobayashi had never even heard of, much less believed in whatever god it belonged to, so she was able to remove the sword without being hurt. The fact that she was drunk out of her mind at the time probably helped.

<ul><li> The Gods of old were willed into existence <em>because</em> people believed they exist. This also explains their downfall, as the number of believers declined... or because their believers think they all died in some massive slugfest (like Ragnarök). In any case, when the Gods withdrew from the world, Magic stopped being the defining essence of reality, to be replaced with the laws of physics (this is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">magic has been slowly declining in power</a> in the Nasuverse as time goes on). Other examples from Nasu include the summoned spirits of dead heroes, who become stronger if their legend is better known, and a weapon designed by the Catholic church for defeating a reincarnating vampire by shoving their belief that reincarnation doesn't exist forcibly down his throat. Or through his liver. Whatever works.

Mazoku have their own form, feeding off of any negative emotions the mortal races have.
<ul><li> In the Novels, Lina was once confronted by Dynast Graushera's General, a very powerful Mazoku. Realizing she couldn't fight or escape, Lina decided to try mocking said Mazoku's name. The reasoning was that because Mazoku were masses of astral energy held together by their own self image, anything that undermined their self confidence would make them weaker. The strategy works.

<ul><li> It's also established that, due to Spiral Power, a Gunman's controls are set to how the pilot thinks it should be controlled. It's possible for someone with no prior training to get into a Gunman, move some joysticks, and get it working solely because that's what they want it to do.

His offspring, the vampires, were once the dominant species on Earth, but as mankind found other gods to worship the Red Death and vampires lost their power until they eventually went dormant. That is, until the carnage of World War I reawakened them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Crimson">Crimson</a></em>, it's the vampire's religious background that counts, as one man learns when the vampire he's trying to ward off takes his cross away and beats him with it, remarking "My name is Steinman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage">schmuck</a>!

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> character <em>Dr. Thirteen</em> was a skeptic who disproved hauntings.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Excalibur">Excalibur</a> member Meggan was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicShapeshifter">empathic adaptive shapeshifter</a> — she looked like what people expected her to look like, and consequently spent a good part of her childhood turning into a monster. Eventually, she managed to develop a strong enough sense of identity that other people's expectations no longer affected her shapeshifting.
<ul><li> In one of those cosmic ironies, the current powerset of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainBritain">Captain Britain</a>, Meggan's husband, depends on his own confidence, much like Gladiator below - the stronger his confidence, the stronger he becomes.
</li></ul></li><li> The living myths in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables">Fables</a></em> are made stronger by those who believe in them. This is used to explain why some lesser-known fables are killed, but Snow White can take a rifle shot to the head and survive, albeit with long-term consequences.
<ul><li> This is turned into a plot point later, when Jack Horner (of "Jack and the Beanstalk," "Jack The Giant Killer," and several other stories) decides to increase his personal power by releasing a series of Hollywood blockbusters about himself.
</li><li> Also, not <em>every</em> Fable gets their power from this; Frau Totenkinder specifically gets her power from 'other' sources. (Don't ask.) Popularity equals power is a theory that's never been tested under controlled conditions.
<ul><li> Subverted by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the death of Little Boy Blue in # 82</span>. The subversion was the huge power of the character in question, as the character itself isn't neither well known nor anywhere near as popular as Snow White and her peers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the August 1966 issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em>, Barry Allen starts to fade away from existence once a villain unleashes a ray that causes everyone to not believe he exists. Everyone except a little orphan girl he had helped before forgets that he really exists until he and the orphan girl start a massive letter writing campaign to force people to remember The Flash.
<ul><li> This issue is somewhat prescient considering that the DCU contains an actual comic book limbo where characters (often those who haven't appeared in books for quite some time in the real world) go to when people start to forget their stories.
</li></ul></li><li> This is central to one of Warren Ellis' stories for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em>. An occult writer "acquires" a magical item called The Crib, and sets about killing people with it. The thing is, there's no such artifact, and it only works because both he and his victims believed in it. John Constantine, being more knowledgeable about the truth of the occult world, <em>knows</em> there's no such item, so it has no effect on him, and he's able to reveal what the person <em>actually</em> had — an old cereal box with a dead mouse in it. It's discussed in earlier stories that magic in general works on this principle, but this is the first one where it really takes center stage and we see just how far it goes.
</li><li> Another example from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> is the Shi'ar Imperial Guard commander Gladiator: His strength is based on his own belief in his power. Shake his confidence and he can be beaten easily, rev it up and he crushes stars with his fists.
<ul><li> His son Kid Gladiator has the same basic powers and an even bigger ego, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">teenager and all</a>. Nothing, <em>not even temporarily being turned into a Brood</em>, has managed to shake him up.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures">Marvel Adventures</a> (and possibly main 616 canon), Dr. Strange's magic works the same way. He deliberately cultivates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> persona to boost his own confidence.
</li></ul></li><li> Yet another example from the Marvel Universe are the Cardinals, who serve as the elite shock troops/assassins for the Universal Church of Truth. The Church collects the Prayer Power of its trillion-plus faithful worshipers, then converts that prayer power into energy and stores it in belief batteries. The Cardinals can tap into that immense power reserve, giving them the power to do anything if they believe they can. Hence the Cardinals can shoot energy beams, create force fields, and etc. because some convert on the other side of the galaxy believes they can do that.
<ul><li> It doesn't even have somebody else, it could be the Cardinal himself who <a class="urllink" href="http://www.comicvine.com/cardinals/65-55707/all-images/108-195836/cardinals_01/105-693528/?offset=0">believes.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<div class="indent"><em>You've read too much fiction, Arnicus.

<ul><li> In one issue there is a story that the world was once run by cats the size of men and humans were the size of cats and were just playthings and servants. Dream told a human that if enough of them dreamt that things were different they would be. After most of humanity dreams that they were in charge the universe is rewritten so that cats had never been the dominant life and nobody remembered these events (except for Dream who naturally tells a cat this story and that they can change it back with enough belief).
<ul><li> This story also shows the flip side of the equation when at the end one cat who's listened to it quips to another that even if all they've heard is true, nobody'll ever get enough cats to <em>agree</em> on what to dream of to actually turn the tables back again.

Also, a god is stronger in his home plane than gods from another.
</li><li> In <em>Thor Meets Captain America</em> by David Brin, this trope is used by the hero.

The plot plays with the notion that this means it's only psychology and suggestion (if you believe you were witchcrafted, you'll just act as if you did). However, the scientific approach is eventually abandoned. Once the antagonists finally manage to get the protagonist convinced that it's real, they can perform supernatural witchcraft on her. They then proclaim it's getting tougher for them to use witchcraft on new victims, as it's getting harder and harder to convince modern people that it's real.

<ul><li> There's a number of urban legends about Christian college students and their atheist professors, who try to convince their students that God isn't real. One variation has the professor hold up a piece of chalk saying that if God was real, he'd stop the chalk from breaking on the ground if he dropped it. The student prays that he will have the courage to tell the professor he believes in God. When he tells the professor this, the chalk slips out of the professor's hand, rolls down his pant leg, bounces off his shoe, and lands on the ground unharmed.
<ul><li> The professor's retort, if someone is around to say it to the original storyteller, goes something like "I've been doing this for twenty years. Either we have a coincidence, or 1/20 of a god."
</li><li> Countered with "God doesn't do cheap tricks for show." Which means it was dumb luck the chalk didn't break.
</li><li> Another version has the professor standing on a chair declaring that if God exists, he should knock him from the chair.

The gods, including such familiar names as the war god Mars and Vulcan the smith, are bored. To entertain themselves, they play a game with humanity: 12 highly powerful magic swords are created, and spread throughout the lands purely to incite wars amongst the various nations. The plan backfires when, thanks to the highly visible power of the various swords, mankind's belief in the gods wane and is replaced by belief in the swords.

<ul><li> Fae is also <em>nasty.</em> It doesn't just make for "proactive" magic; things based entirely on natural laws DON'T work if their user has any fear they might malfunction.

If you look at sources that go into more detail about the background, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRolePlayingGame">Tabletop Role-Playing Game</a> resource <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSDiscworld">GURPS Discworld</a></em> or especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScienceOfDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScienceOfDiscworld">The Science of Discworld</a></em> series, you'll see that the Discworld is set in a universe different from ours, with the powerful added combined element of magic/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeCausality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeCausality">Narrative Causality</a>/power of belief. Narrative Causality especially ties to Clap Your Hands If You Believe and overlaps with it. On the Discworld, most people's beliefs about how the world works are as naïve and unrealistic and prone to forming neat narratives as in our world, but belief distorts reality so that they become sort of true in retrospect. So you might falsely believe your god is great and powerful, but when enough people believe the god is great, they <em>will become</em> powerful. Good luck trying to make the god good and wise, though — that's not what you get by worshipping someone and giving them power. (And anyway, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">been remarked</a> that people don't really believe that's what their gods are like in the first place, even though of course they'll say that. Really what you expect is more like your father after a long day at work.)
<ul><li> Similarly, it's remarked (in <em>The Science of Discworld</em>) that the Fifth Elephant that is supposed to have crashed onto the Disc may be just a myth, and the deposits of fat and whatnot found underground at the supposed crash site may be from lots of ordinary megafauna having got buried in some lesser disaster. On Roundworld, you could test this by seeing whether the deposits are in the shape of one big elephant. On the Discworld, there's no point because they will have that shape regardless, since that's the story people are now telling.
</li><li> The climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em> involved <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a beloved leader who had died and was being tormented by the prayers of those who put her on a godlike pedestal.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather">Hogfather</a></em>, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was magically preventing people from believing in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas">local equivalent</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a>, the extra, unused belief-energy made any imaginary creature that was even slightly plausible (like a creature that eats odd socks, and a bird that eats pencil stubs) come into existence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em> describes in detail how gods come into existence and become powerful — and what happens when their followers lose genuine faith. Om, the main god in the story, despite his massive religion, was down to one sincere believer and one atheist who was almost as good because he <em>very specifically</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist">didn't believe in Om</a>.
</li><li> "Belief" is stated as a very powerful force on the Discworld — if enough people believe something to be true, it will become true, however there are limits. The rules have never been fully stated, but it appears there needs to be a "space" that makes it somewhat reasonable such a thing could be true (hence the non-existence of the Give-The-Dean-A-Big-Bag-Of-Money goblin). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">Pyramids</a></em> the mess of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverCosmology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverCosmology">multiple combined mythologies</a> that made up the religion of Djelibeybi, much of which was self-contradictory, and a lot of which could be contradicted by simple observation, only became true when the kingdom was pushed into an alternate reality with an even lower reality threshold than the Disc.
</li><li> This is the reason why the arguably most powerful goddess in the Discworld pantheon is "The Lady With Green Eyes", implied to be Lady Luck. Because no matter what faith you belong to, if you find yourself in deadly peril she's the one you ultimately prays to, and believe in.
</li><li> Mistress Weatherwax does this on many occasions, usually boxing the ears of said fairies. She doesn't believe in Death, because it's like believing in the postman. Witches and wizards generally take the same attitude about Gods. They <em>know</em> the Gods are there, so there's no call to go <em>believing</em> in them.
</li><li> An evil witch set herself up as secret ruler of the Magic Kingdom of Genua in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchesAbroad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WitchesAbroad">Witches Abroad</a></em> by manipulating the lives of people, and reality itself, by bending fairy tales around herself.

They're everywhere! Every religion has a different one!"</span>. This concept is later expanded on by the Black Ribbon Society of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire">Vegetarian Vampires</a>, which provided a better integration within a multicultural modern city.
</li><li> The <em>New Discworld Companion</em> has as Watch standard gear "One holy symbol of recruit's choice, vampires, for the discouragement of. One Critique of Pure Reason, vampires, for the discouragement of (Freethinker's option)." This was before a vampire <em>joined</em> the Watch...
</li><li> What happens to people on the Discworld after they die is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">determined by what they believe</a>. Not necessarily what they want, but what they believe. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em>, there is a character who believes in Om, but after he dies he thinks about what he believes and it's implied that he has a slightly different outcome than other Om believers. He has a different outlook on life than other Om believers, and therefore, something different would happen to him.
<div class="indent">"What happens to people after they die is what they believe will happen. The people who go to hell are the ones who believe, deep down in their hearts, that they deserve it. However, if you've never heard of hell before, it's impossible to believe in it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">That is why it is important to kill missionaries on sight</a>."
</div></li><li> A group of people (the entire crew of a ship) who are assumed to be Omnians (as they live in Omnia) but know full well that it's all rubbish get a completely different afterlife from all the other Omnians. They decide to go looking for the afterlifes of those foreign gods they've heard of, where you get food, wine, and women for all eternity.
</li><li> <em>Draco nobilis</em>, the noble dragon, is a species so dependent on magic for survival that when the Discworld's magical ambiance declined to its present level, they were forced to retreat to a new habitat: the human imagination. At present they can only become real in a magic-saturated locale where an imaginative human visualizes them, as Twoflower and the Wyrmberg's ruling family do in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheColourOfMagic">The Colour of Magic</a></em>, and the Elucidated Brothers do in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards">Guards!

</li><li> Things and places may gain a magic, life or attitude of their own due to belief and people's dedication to them — like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant">a historical artifact of great value (even when it's not the real one)</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade">the opera</a>, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RaisingSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RaisingSteam">steam engine</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> was written, vampire lore included an aversion to a cross. This, in different series, can be either the product of the vampire's belief in the cross, or the product of the wielder's belief in the cross. In Dracula itself it only really works for the Catholic Van Helsing; the others, mostly Church of England members, just can't take the idea seriously. Often, it also works with another strong symbol of belief — for example, a rabbi using a Star of David to hold a vampire at bay. See: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Our Vampires Are Different</a>.

Magical beings don't necessarily require belief, but they DO require Knowledge of their existence in order to exist in the mortal world at all. Human perception can also shift their nature, sometimes even creating multiple distinct personalities for the same being. For example Odin is technically the same person as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Santa Claus</span>, although there are some differences. This has even been stated to be able to capable of cosmic scale Retcons. For example, if enough people believe that the Abrahamic God created the universe, then things will change such that God will have ALWAYS created the universe.
<ul><li> Symbols of faith also harm vampires, although the user has to believe in the symbol. A cross won't work for Dresden but will be incredibly effective for his friend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">divine Knight of the Cross</a> Michael. Conversely Harry's pentacle charm (a symbol of magic) will work for him, but not for Michael. Michael's faith in particular is strong enough that it's even able to cause a Red Court vampire (who is not particularly weak to symbols of faith) to instantly burst into flames on contact.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the above mentioned Knights of the Cross don't actually require Faith in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>, with only one of them being particularly religious. Shiro was converted without understanding (but he tries his best to be a good Baptist regardless), Sanya is Agnostic (despite having received a magic sword from an archangel), and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Butters</span>, the most recent Knight of the Cross is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jewish</span> and not particularly religious. Uriel makes it clear that the important factor is faith in doing good and helping people in general, including defending others against evil as well as redeeming those who have made mistakes in the past. In Michael's case does this come along with his Christian Faith, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Butters</span> belief in <em>Star Wars</em> as a story of people fighting for good and triumphing over evil is a large part of his Faith.
</li></ul></li><li> Dresden, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonSmartass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonSmartass">First-Person Smartass</a> he is, goes on to <em>mock</em> this trope during the climax of the fourth book, <em>Summer Knight</em>, by charging into a Fae battle screaming <strong>"I don't believe in faeries!!"</strong> It doesn't actually do anything , but certainly is good for the adrenaline. Knowledge of fairies does matter just like everything else, though, as Mab made sure the Brother Grimm published books of Fairy tales to ensure that humans continued to know about them. And on a smaller scale, the more authority Harry has give Toot-toot and the more he accomplishes, the bigger he gets. In the first book he is only six inches tall; by the 12th book, he is more than 15 inches tall.<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">Him becoming the leader of the "'Za Lord's Guard" and gaining followers</a> actually results in him personally becoming more powerful.
</li><li> Magic in the Dresdenverse requires belief in whatever the caster is doing. A caster cannot produce a spell if they do not, deep down, believe in the reasons behind why they are casting the spell. This is actually a small but critical plot point in <em>Turn Coat</em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Senior Council LaFortier</span>'s murder involved no magic being slung. It is eventually revealed that the killer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was being mind-controlled</span>, but understood that they shouldn't be attacking <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">LaFortier</span>. Meanwhile <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">LaFortier</span> was too confused and shocked at the sight of someone they knew attacking them to magically defend themself.
</li><li> As an aside, this is why breaking the laws of magic is such an irredeemable taboo. The more a mage uses their magic to commit these crimes, the more it reinforces in their minds that doing them is right. Harry recounts witnessing the execution of a teenage wizard who spent weeks mind controlling his family, and by the end he was a lunatic with a god complex. Generally theyre only spared from execution if they didnt know there were laws to break in the first place and a senior wizard stakes their life on a successful rehabilitation.
</li><li> In the Novella <em>Backup</em>, Thomas and Lara Raith are members of a secret society which uses this to banish creatures by making humans forget about them. The only way to truly win is to eliminate all knowledge of a particular being from humanity, making for some of the most severe "need-to-know" requirements ever faced by any army. Being vampires, the Raiths aren't in it for the good of humanity, but rather to protect eliminate their competition. Word of God has discussed that this is also the purpose of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Archive</span>. Once everyone else has forgotten about a particular being, they wait for a few years, keeping an eye out for any mentions of the being until ultimately erasing their own memory of it as well, ensuring it is well and truly gone forever.
</li><li> This trope is conversed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame">Skin Game</a>. Harry and a member of his crew come across the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudOfTurin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudOfTurin">Shroud of Turin</a></span>. Someone asks why the fake has magic powers and Harry replies that if enough people believe the fake is real, it gains some power through said belief. That being said, it's still pretty clear that the fake is not as powerful as the real deal.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eisenhorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Eisenhorn">Eisenhorn</a></em> novel <em>Malleus</em>, the title character is able to severely weaken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">a Chaos-corrupted stone</a> by recording himself reciting one of the (many) Imperial declarations of faith and continually transmitting the recording into the stone.
<ul><li> In the third book <em>Hereticus</em>, after Eisenhorn is forced to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">release the bound daemon Cherubael</span> in order to defeat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Chaos Battle Titan</span>, he then tries to weaken him by reciting The Benediction of Terra. However by that point Eisenhorn has been both physically and mentally drained and couldn't force his will enough for the prayer to actually have effect. On the other hand, a crazed Imperial priest who witnesses all of this manages to scare off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cherubael</span> by mistaking him for a manifestation of the Emperor's power and running at him at full speed, chanting praises for the Emperor and holding a holy Imperial Aquilla, hurting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the daemon</span> with the sheer force of his belief in the Emperor.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings">David Eddings</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium">The Elenium</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTamuli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTamuli">The Tamuli</a></em> series, gods' powers are derived from their worshippers' belief. The Elene God is thus very powerful; the Younger Styric Gods have less individual power but together are considered comparable to the Elene God. Meanwhile, the Elder Styric Gods were severely weakened as a result of being forgotten to the point that all but one (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Azash, who found new believers in the Zemochs</span>) were bound and sealed away. The Tamul gods, who are worshipped only superficially, end up manifesting as simple, childlike deities. Then there are the Forgotten Ones—gods without worshippers who are reduced to shapeless wisps with barely even a voice. Someone actually tries to depower a goddess by ordering the slaughter of her worshippers (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zalasta, after he's been outed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">Mole</a></span>), so the other Styric Gods each chip in some of their belief until the crisis is averted.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PastDoctorAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PastDoctorAdventures">Past Doctor Adventures</a> novel <em>Salvation</em> features a race of beings who gain power based on the belief others have in them, to the extent that they have been shaped into modern-day gods due to the prayers for salvation from the general population. Recognising the danger of these beings, at one point the First Doctor deliberately provokes the head of this pantheon into attacking him after inspiring doubt in the gods in their worshippers, with the result that he survives being hit by a fireball in front of a crowd of believers because his belief that he cant be hurt outweighs the crowds belief in his attacker. The Doctor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later drives these beings away by dropping a dud bomb on the park where their congregation has gathered and making everyone present think it can hurt their gods</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FactionParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FactionParadox">Faction Paradox</a></em> beings known as the Celestis are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascended beings</a> that are tethered in reality by nothing more than the power of others' belief in them; therefore, they appear as gods or demons wherever they choose to manifest.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForbidden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForbidden">The Forbidden</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CliveBarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CliveBarker">Clive Barker</a>, the original version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Candyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Candyman">Candyman</a></em> worked this way as much as his film counterpart. He needs people to believe in him to exist. Should someone doubt him or damage his reputation he will be obliged to show himself to them and take some innocent blood for good measure.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Freya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Freya">Freya</a></em> series, this is the foundation of divinity. Belief defines all of the book's gods, physically and mentally, and this is discussed, played with, and even used - particularly by the villains - as a tool.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGolgothaSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGolgothaSeries">The Golgotha Series</a></em>, Jim sees that Mormon religious artifacts have magical power and asks if that means the Mormon religion is the correct one. The Angel Biqa responds that enough of any form of belief will grant power.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Goes horribly, horribly wrong</a> in regard to the "Stuff" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoneAwayWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoneAwayWorld">The Gone-Away World</a></em> by Nick Harkaway. It becomes not what you believe, but what you're <em>thinking of</em>—and if you're thinking of ten things at once, it'll become a splice of all 10 things. This gets even worse if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrauma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrauma">get covered in Stuff</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em> not only explicitly uses this concept as the core of its magic system, but actually introduces a system which measures the intensity of belief in one of its footnotes.
</li><li> A variant occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaroldShea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaroldShea">Harold Shea</a></em> stories by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> and Fletcher Pratt, in which it's possible to travel to another world by believing in the logical principles that govern that world. The place you're going was real to begin with (even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">they're all based on mythology or literature</a>), but believing the right things makes it accessible to your senses. The inverse also works: the scientist in the team doesn't believe in any of this and thus makes a fine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> weapon.

Because we had no-one left to blame, but lacked the emotional maturity to take responsibility for our actions, our subconscious minds started to blame <em>every fairy-tale-style monster ever</em>, at which point they appeared and began to terrorise the world's cities.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HellsKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HellsKitchenSink">Hell's Kitchen Sink</a></em> The collective minds of humanity have formed entire pantheons. This is not the only source of magic, however.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmLegend">I Am Legend</a></em>, vampires fear the holy symbol of what they believed in before they became vampires. The Protagonist's archenemy is terrified by the Star of David.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronDruidChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronDruidChronicles">Iron Druid Chronicles</a></em>, all gods and supernatural entities are created by human belief and thought, including Jesus, the Celtic gods, the Norse gods, Elvis Presley and the comic book version of Thor.
</li><li> In the horror novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jago">Jago</a></em>, a town is afflicted with a force that causes people's beliefs and obsessions to become real. A small boy is able to defeat the Evil Dwarf that lurks in his room after the lights go out by ceasing to believe in it; he finds that it's a lot less plausible when it appears in clearly visible physical form than it was as a vague possibility lurking in the dark. The manifestations that successfully do in the people who feared them tend to fade away afterward unless they've been witnessed by somebody else and a new belief created. The horrifically deformed revenant Badmouth Ben manages to survive for quite a while after taking his revenge on his murderer because he finds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">Nightmare Fetishist</a> who wants him to stick around. The manifestation of Danny Keough's terrors tries to get someone else to believe in her, but nobody else can because Danny's fears were so personal and idiosyncratic that nobody else can understand what she is, let alone believe that she exists.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IT">IT</a></em>, the eponymous shapeshifting monster takes the form of a werewolf, making it vulnerable to silver simply because the child heroes of the book firmly believe that werewolves <em>have</em> to be vulnerable to silver. Also, believing that his inhaler was full of poison allowed a protagonist to harm It with the contents.
</li><li> Established in King's writing much earlier in his short story <em>The Boogeyman</em>, which is in many ways a precursor to <em>IT</em>.
</li><li> A cross does not work on a vampire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SalemsLot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SalemsLot">'Salem's Lot</a></em> because its owner has lost his faith. When that character faces vampires again in a later King book, he has recovered his faith and is able to (briefly) drive them off, even after he puts the cross aside - it's only a symbol, after all.
</li><li> It should be noted that disbelief in the supernatural generally doesn't protect against it in King's works. For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/It" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/It">It</a></em>, the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality-warping</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">shape-shifting</a> monster devours victims regardless of whether or not they believe in the supernatural, but strong enough belief in supernatural things (like, the fact that silver bullets can be used against It when It takes the form of a werewolf) allows the protagonists to fight back. Also, in the short story <em>1408</em>, the hotel manager urges Mike Enslin, a writer of books that chronicle his sojourns in supposedly haunted locales, not to stay in room 1408 specifically because he <em>doesn't</em> believe in the supernatural, and things will go worse for him because of it.
</li><li> This is a recurring theme for King, it shows up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeedfulThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeedfulThings">Needful Things</a></em>, the Sheriff is able to assault the demonic Gaunt with a bunch of sleight of hand tricks made into real sorcery by simply willing himself to believe it'll work. Conversely in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand">The Stand</a></em>, sociology professor Glen Bateman understands the nature of Flagg's powers and is so focused on believing that Flagg's magic only works if one believes in it, that Flagg really couldn't cast anything on Bateman and had to order a lackey to shoot him. A little later against a rebellious cultist, Flagg is able to roast him alive with magic because of the man's fear and belief.
</li></ul></li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingdomKeepers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingdomKeepers">Kingdom Keepers</a></em>. Enough people believing in them is what causes several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> characters to come to life...including the villains, who are putting the world in danger.
</li><li> This appears to be the driving force behind mythological beings in the <em>Logical Magician</em> series of books by Robert Weinberg. In the second book, an Amazon (naturally, exceedingly beautiful) serving as a weapons instructor is explicitly confronted by the main character with theories regarding the rather hideous appearance of historical amazon women; he's rebuffed with "Maybe the real ones were. We aren't." Applies to myths both old and new; one of the most feared mythological beings around is 'The Man'. Also given an interesting inversion; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nergal, the Babylonian god of disease, has been hauled into the modern world. With no believers to get rid of, he seems invincible, until the main character gets an article about him published in several supermarket tabloids.

Shortly, it goes like this: Since nothing as useful as the Babelfish can be born through coincidence, this proves God's existence, but with knowledge, there isn't faith, and without faith, God is nothing. This seems to follow the same logic. It's also noted that most theologians consider the whole thing "a load of Dingo's kidneys".

In fact, the ideal citizen is one who can subconsciously alter his perception, memory, and experiences to meet whatever the Party says in order to make it true. Of course, the mind doesn't change any independent physical things, but that's not the point, since the Party doesn't really believe in those anyway, or at least doesn't care about them.

</li><li> A rare inversion with the short story "Obstinate Uncle Otis" by the great horror writer <a class="urllink" href="http://scottnicolay.com/stories-from-the-borderland-4-4-the-believers-aka-do-you-believe-in-ghosts-by-robert-arthur-jr/">Robert A. Arthur, Jr.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — it's in <em>Ghosts and More Ghosts</em> — about an obstinate Vermonter (and as such, the most obstinate man in the world) whose power of disbelief was legendary, to the point where he could almost convince others that their eyes were tricking them. And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything">he got struck by lightning</a>, and got a dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Reality</a>. The statue in the town square to the man he hated? Gone after he commented about how "No one would build a statue to a nincompoop like that!" The barn that was obstructing a nice view? Also gone when he commented how "No barn there, boy! Nothing but th' view - finest view in Vermont." His nephew realizes the danger this poses (e.g. his hatred of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D.

"Decrees and affirmations" are not just declarations of faith but recitations of things you <em>want</em> to have happen, <em>as if they were already true.</em> A cancer patient might decree, "I am free of cancer and perfectly healthy." In Wicca and some other Neo-Pagan religions, a variant is taught: you can perform magic(k) by visualizing the desired results and focusing your will upon them, but doubts in the efficacy of the technique will rob you of the necessary focus and prevent it from working. <br/><br/>Some practitioners of magic(k) claim that any symbol has the power the magic(k)ian invests in it. This can lead to two conclusions: One, the whole subjectivist interpretation (the idea of all persons living in a reality of their own making, thus not the same as the one everyone else lives in), or two, that humans actually innately possess some huge magic power, but have developed mental blocks to prevent the world's destruction by a toddler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, and such symbols are ways around these psychic walls.

The nega-psychic has psychic powers, but is so convinced that supernatural phenomena are bunk that his power is used unconsciously to suppress all psychic and magical phenomena in his area. For example, a character who can normally lift things with telekinesis will find it difficult or impossible to do so around the nega-psychic, thus bolstering the nega-psychic's belief that there is no such thing as telekinesis.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>, the gods exist independent of mortals entirely, but their power in the material world seems to be dependent on their worshipers - as in, the stronger churches are better able to carry out what they divine as the will of their god... though different religions don't even agree on whether or not that is even necessary. It isn't even strictly made clear that the gods actually <em>exist</em>, or whether the manifestations and abilities of priests and so forth are just a (local) result of their faith. And some of the things that are worshiped as gods (such as the Dreaming Dark) don't really fit any conventional use of the term.
</li><li> The book <em>Faiths of Eberron</em> makes this trope even more evident. Followers of the Lord of Blades (A warforged of considerable might, but who is mortal) have access to divine magic from their belief/faith in <em>his</em> divinity and his cause.
</li><li> In the 3.5 core rules, clerics were able to gain power by revering a cause. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> actually had attempts to train clerics of <em>nationalism</em> (although it failed... except in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">Riedra</a>).
</li><li> The 2E supplement <em>Shaman</em> used this trope extensively, with the twist that any spirits generated by such power of belief weren't considered "real" by deities, or at least, not as "real" as the deities themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em>, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>, prefers to keep its gods' legitimacy subject to doubt. At least one of the major deities of the Land of Mists, Zhakata, is <em>expressly stated</em> to be the figment of a crazy darklord's twisted imagination. This doesn't prevent clerics of Zhakata from receiving divine spells when they pray. (However, it is also stated that their spells are granted by Ravenloft itself, rather than what they believe.)
</li><li> Inverted with two spells of the Illusion school, <em>phantasmal killer</em> and the even more powerful <em>weird</em>. These spells create incredibly convincing illusions in the mind of a victim of his greatest fear that can literally cause him to die of fright. The only way to fight it is to realize it isn't real and have enough willpower to "disbelieve" it (whether a victim can succeed or not depends on a lot of factors, including his Wisdom score and how powerful the wizard casting it is).

Magic and super-science fails to work in a Mundane's presence, and at the higher levels monsters, aliens and assorted other non-normal entities actually change to have mundane explanations (a monster turns into someone wearing a monster costume, the alien invasion turns into a movie set) until the character leaves the area.

</li><li> Elsewhere in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a>, spirits of things reflect what people <em>believe</em> that thing should be — a dog spirit, for instance, is nearly the platonic ideal of a dog — but it's left deliberately unclear whether this is because human belief shapes spirits, or spirits shape human belief. Is a spider spirit the way it is because we believe a spider should be this way... or do we think spiders should be this way because this is how spider spirits are?

When enough people believe in something, and then suddenly <em>stop</em> believing (like, say, if it's publicly disproven), the energy of all those minds changing their opinion releases Mania into the world. This has created, among other things, an underground world full of dinosaurs, an army of Martian invaders, and a race of Aryan "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUbermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUbermensch">Übermenschen</a>" of genuinely superhuman ability.

"That can't happen," they think, and their belief is strong enough to <em>make</em> it unhappen, make them forget it ever happened, and punish the mage for his attempt. Conversely, mages have carefully-constructed belief systems that allow them to impose their wills upon reality and reshape it as they see fit. For example, the Earth never used to orbit the Sun, steam power never used to be possible, until the Technocracy managed to make most of humanity believe in it.
<ul><li> This actually extends to when the normal people _aren't_ directly observing a spell, too, the immediate impact just isn't as acute. Nature isn't actually natural, it's a carefully constructed useful lie that the Technocracy taught to the mortals because how arbitrary and chaotic things were was getting annoying. For instance, there's not actually any such thing as gravity: you fall at 9.8 m/s2 near the earth's surface because that idea is engraved on the Sleeper unconscious by a wizard-run education system.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>, vampires aren't averted by crosses or other holy symbols unless the wielder's faith is particularly strong. In addition, a vampire character may purchase a number of supernatural flaws that are common to vampire lore: be it being repulsed by crosses, being unable to cross running water, being unable to enter a house uninvited... Depending on the DM and player's interpretation, those flaws are either factual problems caused by the character's particular bloodline (after all, <em>someone</em> must have given rise to those myths, and that someone probably sired other vampires) or this trope: the vampire fears garlic, because he's convinced vampires do.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em>, the various deities (and their progeny, including the player characters) derive power from the number of people who are aware of their exploits. This is known as Legend. However, while the Gods make sure stories about them maintain circulation, they discourage outright <em>worship</em>, because Fate is a <em>bastard</em> when it comes to such strong connections. It's a dangerous balancing act.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> (fourth edition, at least), there are numerous magical traditions based on assorted religious and philosophical beliefs, but all are equally capable paths to studying magic. In addition, spirits take on the shape of whatever the caster believes they should take the shape of; a spirit of fire can look like everything from a triumphant archangel to a happy little puff of flame depending on who summons it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Toon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Toon">Toon</a></em>, things like gravity will only work on you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityIsAHarshMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityIsAHarshMistress">if you remember that it should</a>. As a result, you can take a Smarts test hoping to fail, and if you do, you can cheerfully row across the sea with a boat that's still tied up at the dock, or make a call from a phone in the middle of the Wild West...
</li><li> This is the basic principle in which magic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em> works. An Adept's obsession warps their view of the world so much that he can bend reality with his will simply because he is absolutely sure that what he does is possible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Orks subconsciously generate a mild psychic field, its strength directly proportional to the amount of "boyz" present, so if enough Orks believe in something then reality is given a swift kick in the balls and told to follow the proper, Orky way of doing things. Ork belief that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority">da red ones go fasta</a>" really <em>does</em> make vehicles painted red move slightly faster, and because Orks believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">the biggest Ork is in charge</a> an Ork will <em>actually grow</em> in response to other Orks following him, and while Orks can't make a stick fire bullets, their powers are able to make a lot of things that shouldn't work shoot bullets. Most of their "shootaz" are little more than boxes filled with gears and bullets that are in the general shapes of guns, and Orks have been known to make ships without fuel fly across solar systems.
<ul><li> The power of the Ork gestalt field varies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheAuthor">Depending on the Author</a>. In one book, an Ork with a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> took on an entire Imperial Guard platoon. When the Ork was killed by a sniper and the gun was recovered, it was found to have no trigger or firing mechanism, making it little more than a metal pipe with a gun belt fed through it. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">another</a>, Ork weapons and vehicles <em>can</em> be used by human forces fairly effectively, but they are still prone to misfires and jams. Ork Mekboyz have a very good instinctive understanding of mechanics, but for the most part, Ork technology requires the gestalt field to work.
</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em> novels, the eponymous commissar has no problems commandeering an Ork buggy beyond the fact that it was designed for a significantly stronger being and as such lacks power steering. Another example is that of a unit of Ork-hunter Imperial Guardsmen who will often loot Ork guns and use them, again with no problems. (These examples all feature the weapons being used against or at least in the presence of Orks, raising the possibility that they wouldn't work if the greenskins weren't there). The general idea is that Ork technology does work, and the Orks' psychic power simply makes it work better. The RPG systems went with this as well; in the hands of an Ork everything works fine, but if a human tries to use it the guns will be unreliable and more advanced or esoteric technology won't work at all.
</li><li> This sometimes even works against the Orks. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">mortal enemy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">Sebastian Yarrick</a>, despite being as badass as a human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">could possibly be</a> in the horrifying <em>40K</em> universe, REALLY should be dead just by weight of age and everything he's endured making his body give out, even with advanced future medicine. But he's accomplished so much against the Orks that they believe he's an unkillable monster, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal">ergo</a>...
</li></ul></li><li> Tech-priests of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">Adeptus Mechanicus</a> <em>are</em> taught genuine mechanical skills, just in an odd and highly-ritualised way involving lots of chanting and application of holy oils in order to please the "machine spirits". Machine spirits are quite real, with many examples of a vehicle functioning long after its crew are dead, or even "going feral" and rampaging across the battlefield. It isn't certain how much of Imperial technology is this trope and how much is genuine engineering.
<ul><li> The holy oils could just be lubrication for various components and the chanting is in binary, it might be some sort of voice activated diagnostic program. And it's not always clear that the machine spirit isn't an on-board AI system. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane</a> is a trope that a large part of the background runs on.
</li><li> The machine spirits seen in some advanced Imperial technologies, like Land Raider tanks, Titans, and some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">older</a> Legio Cybernetica robots, are described as complex computer systems, akin to an artificial intelligence (although they get around the Imperium's AI ban by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">not being fully sentient</a>, and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology">not being entirely mechanical</a>). In simpler cases, it's hard to say if the machine has a literal spirit, or if that's just the Mechanicus' way of handwaving quirks that could be attributed to manufacturing variations, like a gun jamming slightly more often than others of its type.
</li></ul></li><li> There are also the faith-based powers of the Adeptus Sororitas (aka Sisters of Battle), particularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em>, where their Faith renders them immune to the negative effects of Daemonic Presence, and provides many other useful abilities at higher character ranks.
</li><li> Several Ecclesiarchal artifacts (usually the bones or personal effects of a dead saint) can bestow this upon its bearer provided that the bearer is faithful enough. Whether this is a direct result of the bearer's beliefs or if it's just some hidden piece of tech that the bearer is unaware of varies depending on the author. Unsurprisingly, the Adepta Sororitas are deeply tied to the Ecclesiarchy, which sometimes accounts for the "miracles" that happen. In one case the belief was strong enough that it rendered anything within the artifact's range of influence to be <em>completely immune to plasma and fusion guns</em>.
</li><li> This is essentially the only hope of <em>anything</em> that's not a Daemon surviving for any length of time in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Warp</a>. Since the Warp is literally a place powered by strong emotions, the only way to avoid being torn apart by its energies or the Daemons inhabiting it is to believe, without an absolute shadow of a doubt, that you <em>can</em> survive a place where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsTryingToKillYou">Everything Is Trying to Kill You</a>. The trick is the fact you need to <em>keep</em> believing this or else the protection goes away. It helps if you're also an extremely powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psyker</a> too, which gives you a better way of controlling your surroundings.
</li><li> Daemons, on the other hand, require this to enter realspace, as otherwise they're stuck as formless masses in the Warp (although there is the rare time they find a powerful but weak-willed psyker to possess). However, once they enter realspace, they no longer need further belief to keep them going (and sometimes will happily murder those who just summoned them). This is why the Imperium and the Inquisition bans any knowledge on daemonic matter, even ones that would theoretically help in a daemonic invasion; the mere knowledge that Daemons exist can sometimes be enough to bring them into realspace.
</li><li> It's implied that the universal belief in the Emperor's divinity within the Imperium is practically allowing him to ascend to godhood.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RuneQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RuneQuest">RuneQuest</a></em>, gods always exist in some form, because they're manifestations of universal laws like Heat, Truth and Plant(s) (the eponymous runes)...but their personalities change. And this effect is localized, as well as retroactive. So if your character gets stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">heroquest</a> bubble where they-as-Chalana-Arroy fail to heal Orlanth's madness, the fact that the 'real', canonical version of Orlanth is a sane, kind person <em>will not help</em>.

Still later, a character turns herself into a figure from the past who united humans and dragons, and everyone once again notices that it behaves just like a Primal. Much later in the story, you meet Hraesvalgyr (a dragon who lived then), and the character shows him her summon, and he reveals that ALL primals are this: belief and faith given aetheric form by basically making a wish near a bunch of crystals.

In truth, many of the most powerful weapons of lore are possessed of far humbler beginnings  common metal, torn from an enemy's grasp in a dire emergency. If the warrior survives the day, the weapon will likely be kept. Polished, sharpened, and re-sharpened, it will be carried from battle to battle, becoming as much a part of the man as his own arm, and as his name rises from warrior to hero to legend, so too will an aura of reverence and awe begin to surround the blade. Legend and belief are powerful forces, and it should be no surprise that a powerful artifact might have become powerful simply by dint of everyone believing it to be powerful. That is, after all, where the gods came from.

The game is set in the outer planes, a multiverse created from the accumulated belief of the people living in the real world (the "Prime Material Plane"), so this operates both on a grand scale (every version of Hell believed in by all of the world's cultures exists somewhere) and a smaller one (in the Planes, one can will a plant to grow or create a person by telling enough people he exists).
</li><li> A key point in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> series, where entities from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">virtually every mythology ever</a> exist specifically because people believe in them.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a> also uses this as a game mechanic - the main dungeons are based on how the villains see the world. Therefore, whatever they believe is true. This causes you to have to change what they believe in order to progress, such as entering a locked room in the real world so that the villain will see the corresponding door open in their Palace. How much ordinary people believe in the main cast is also important: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when their belief rating hits 0%, the main characters stop existing; when it hits 100% belief, the protagonist is capable of summoning a Persona that's bigger than a skyscraper and powerful enough to headshot a god.</span>

<ul><li> Which directly contradicts <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiII">Shin Megami Tensei II</a></em> where the faith of the archangels running the town somehow managed to create a fantom YHVH who sanctified their actions.

As the game continues and all people concerned become more desperate and determined, the difficulty level and the potency of available weapons increases. This also explains why the mysterious "power" is limited to the eponymous town, as only a small cult there believes in it... until the more recent games, that is.
<ul><li> The film makes this somewhat canon. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The little girl's hatred, combined with that of a spirit of vengeance, transforms the town into a hell. In turn, the cult it was created to punish is protected by their faith; more precisely, it's their blind ignorance of their own fate which prevents the spirit from killing them all (until it finds a loophole).</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulBlazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulBlazer">SoulBlazer</a></em> has the protagonist using the Dream Rod to travel into someone's dream, which take place in nearby real locations. Often, he'l be led to step on a floor panel that will open a nearby pathway. When he returns to reality and visits the same location of the dream, it will have changed in the same way.

In both games the premise is that the kids are engaging in LARP (fantasy themed in the first game and superhero themed in the second game). However, their attacks even seem to work against those who <em>aren't</em> part of the LARP, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including <em>aliens</em> and <em>eldritch gods</em>.</span>

<ul><li> While only gods need faith, <em>belief</em> is hugely important to the setting. Youkai (most of the cast) are created from humans ascribing the mysterious to unknown forces, and will fade away if people stop believing in them. Since this has mostly happened, the setting is behind a barrier that causes it to be sort of the opposite of the rest of the world, pulling in things that people don't believe in.
</li><li> In some cases, even the inhabitants of Gensoukyou have stopped clapping their hands. E.g., things from the outside world sometimes slip through the barrier, and one of the things that slipped through in the past was a scientific magazine that explained how echoes are actually just sound waves bouncing off surfaces. As a result of people learning this, the Yamabiko, mountain-dwelling spirits born from humans ascribing echoes to the Yamabiko shouting people's words back at them, are currently facing extiction via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic">Puff of Logic</a>.

But he was a great leader who could inspire confidence and bolster his troops morale, and they would in turn fight harder than they would despite the odds against them.

</li><li> Miracles in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> series seemingly work this way, being tales of miracles and accomplishments performed by the gods, which grant their effects when recited by one with sufficiently high Faith.

The Ambassador could make the King of Alagadda divine by convincing the people of Alagadda to belive in the stories he told of the King's divinity. Unfortunately, this also meant that the Ambassador could manipulate the King however he wanted, simply by telling stories.

This ultimately became the King's doom, as the Ambassador had told story that the God-King's journey to immortality would end when he hang from the highest tower, and placed on his spiked throne, leaving the Ambassador to be his herald to the people. And that's the story of the Hanged King.

She even states that there were times that without her belief in Hera, she would not have been successful. Note that Hera is real in this universe, though actual divine intervention is left up to interpretation.

As long as he's convinced that he's unlucky, unlucky he shall be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em>: In one episode, the city was visited by two benign ghosts who appeared to be Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, and a very <em>nasty</em> one who appeared to be Professor Moriarty (who eventually conjures up a demonic version of the Hound of Baskervilles). Egon at first thought this didn't make sense; as fictional characters, these people were never alive to begin with, and thus could not be ghosts. When it became clear that they were indeed the real deal, he brought up a theory he had read about called "belief made manifest". What this meant was, if enough humans believe that a fictitious character is real and he has enough fans, it can give the character a pseudo-life, which seems to be what happened. Once they figured this out... The game was afoot!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, the Imaginationland storyline revealed this to be the case (technically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">Doing In the Wizard</a> in doing so). Everything and everyone ever imagined by someone on Earth is real in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand">Imaginationland</a>, including all religious figures (even including real people believed to be gods and prophets, such as Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon faith). This is made hilarious if one remembers that Jesus has a public access television show in the real world.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>: Recently-deceased villain Slade has returned to beat the living crap out of Robin... or so Robin thinks.

He is able to disbelieve in his opponent just in time to save himself from the killing blow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>
<ul><li> An episode of revealed that laughter (or, perhaps more correctly, the Power Of Fandom) helped cartoon characters stay young.
</li><li> It is revealed the classic gag of running onto air and not falling is because of this trope. The character believes they are on safe "ground" but looking down causes them to disprove it and gravity takes effect.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> the Believix transformation's powers are amplified when humans believe in the Winx.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder22');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder22" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Generally invoked by phony mediums, psychics, fortune-tellers and such charlatans when they fail to perform during controlled experiments. Many of them would argue that the general atmosphere of skepticism around them is suppressing their powers. (In Modern Spiritualism, disbelief or skepticism won't stop real spirits from communicating, although they may get a little snarky.)
</li><li> Most superstitions work this way. Believing something may encourage someone to try things and do things they might not otherwise. Like athletes who tend to have the most unusual and personalized superstitions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfirmationBias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfirmationBias">Confirmation Bias</a> also plays into it. If you do a superstitious ritual or action, and something "good" comes of it (or at least nothing "bad"), you attribute it to the superstition. Likewise, if you forget to do the superstition, and something "bad" happens, even if it was probably a coincidence, you'll still attribute it to the lack of the superstition.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacy">Logical Fallacy</a> known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToPopularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToPopularity">argumentum ad populum</a></em> implies this. For some reason that doesn't stop people from using it, even though the implications should be obvious.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_paradox">G.E. Moore's eponymous Paradox<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> asserting that something is true <em>demonstrates one's belief</em> that it is true. It's kinda like screaming in a rage ("I'M NOT ANGRY!").
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/ah-managers/1229">An argument<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight">Not Always Right</a> involves this trope when a customer seeks a blue camera and no such item exists in the stock, so the manager plays along in order to get the customer to buy a red one.
</li><li> Pat Robertson <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/04/01/robertson-god-gives-less-miracles-to-too-educated-americans-who-learn-science/">claims<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the credulous will get more miracles than the skeptical.
</li><li> The placebo effect is the real life equivalent of this. This is generally attributed to the nervous system and the immune system being interconnected, and the idea that the immune system can be activated in a specific part of the body. The effect is strongest when treating symptoms with a strong mental component, like pain and nausea.
<ul><li> There is one instance of rats being tricked into curing themselves of a certain type of cancer by a placebo. They were given normal water, then the real stuff in flavored water long enough to cause remission, then normal water again long enough for the cancer to cease going into remission, then flavored water without the chemo.
</li><li> More drug trials have been seeing larger and larger parts of the placebo control group actually having positive reactions. This is mostly chalked up to people having a much stronger belief in modern medical pharmacology, and hence are more likely to believe the placebo is really a new miracle drug.
</li><li> There's the related <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo">nocebo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> effect which has been claimed as powerful enough to kill people.
</li><li> This effect can get really interesting and weird: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/dec/22/placebo-effect-patients-sham-drug">The placebo effect can happen even when people are TOLD it's a placebo!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Quantum Mechanics (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">a misinterpretation of it</a>, especially the part which indicates that mere observance changes the outcome of an event), is often used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> for any and all of the above. However, this <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_causes_collapse#Criticism">is not a mainstream or even accepted interpretation for quantum mechanics except for a tiny minority<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the entire <em>point</em> of Quantum Mechanics in the first place is that subatomic particles behave completely differently from larger matter.
<ul><li> Incidentally the reason why observation changes objects on the quantum level is that the only way to observe any subatomic particle is to collide it with another subatomic particle. It has nothing to do with consciousness changing the reality, as subatomic particles collide anyway all the time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Money itself</em> depends on this trope.
<ul><li> Money gains or loses its worth only based upon widespread belief in it (specifically, the faith the holder has in his ability to exchange it for something he really wants like food, which is dependent on the other guy with the food having enough faith that he can in turn use that money to trade for something else like clothes, and so on). Currency that could be used to buy quite a lot one day can be next to worthless the next, in the right circumstances. The money itself hasn't changed, the little squiggly world leader imprinted on it hasn't changed; its value derives entirely from how widely it is believed to have value.
</li><li> Bank runs, where people believe that their bank is failing and rush to take their money out of it, which causes more people to believe that the bank is failing, which causes more people to take their money out of it, which eventually causes the bank to truly fail, even if the original reason for thinking that that the bank was failing was completely false.
</li><li> The stock market. Expectations of the future are one of the most powerful forces, as evidenced by how stocks consistently rise/fall after optimistic/dour speeches, reports and addresses. So if the market tanks, it will come back to life if everyone just believes in it.
</li></ul></li><li> This is how hypnotism works.
<ul><li> You have to <em>believe</em> that you can be hypnotized in order for it to work, and it is impossible to be hypnotized against your will. The fact that the word "hypnotism" is applied to a half-dozen or so completely unrelated ideas, some well-understood and some utterly absurd, muddies the waters.
</li><li> In addition, even if you believe you can be hypnotized, you cannot be commanded to do things you are unwilling to do consciously. A man might be able to be hypnotized into thinking an orange is a apple, but if he believes stealing is wrong, there is no way you can force him to take money out of a wallet without permission. Theoretically he can be made to believe that the wallet is his own, but this depends on the skills of the hypnotist and the susceptibility of the subject.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the most likely explanation of the Midnight Game. The environment and the setup mean the player(s) will spend three and a half hours stressing, worrying, and freaking themselves out.
</li><li> Some more modern branches of the occult (in particular, Chaos Magic) follow this line of belief. The idea is that while the magic itself might not be real, the belief in it is very real and may be able to 'trick' your mind into believing that it is real (for example, curses only working if the victim feels like they've been cursed, and therefore would begin to associate every little misfortune with the curse so that, in their mind at least, they have been cursed). Scientists who study belief in magic have found the same thing to be true of people such as Australian Aboriginals-when cursed (at least in the past) they would worry themselves to death over it, or sometimes even die of heart attacks. It still only worked if they knew they'd been cursed, though that was enough. However, it failed to work on Europeans when they arrived due to their disbelief, much to the horror of the Aboriginals.
</li><li> Invoking this trope is an advised method of avoiding The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma">Centipede's Dilemma</a>: if you believe you will be successful in a task you already know how to do, you are not likely to overthink the actual process and goof yourself up.
</li><li> There are many, many things that are true because they are widely believed or felt to be true, or because people have widely accepted certain conventions. If the consensus or conventions changed, the statements would no longer be true. The example of money is above. Further examples: The correct adjectival term in Standard American English in 2016 for things related to France is French. The Nobel Prize is highly prestigious. Tickets to the NBA Finals are widely desired by many people. Aardvark comes before zoology in alphabetical order in English.
</li><li> Fiction works like this too. Break the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a> and a lot of the magic drains away.
</li><li> Technically speaking, colors like white pink don't exist. Visible light, at least for humans, consists of just red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Every other color is just the result of human brains trying to mix the wavelengths.
<ul><li> Color is a property that has no way of being described without referencing things that exhibit the color as a property (i.e. You cannot describe Blue, but only things that are blue like the sky or blueberries). This leaves an interesting conundrum as to if the color blue is the same visually for all humans, since language is limited in its ability to describe color without referencing things that are of that color.
