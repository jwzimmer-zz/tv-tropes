</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FinnegansWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FinnegansWake">Finnegans Wake</a></em> is in some ways a more literal example of this trope than most, as it ends in the middle of a sentence that is completed at the beginning of the novel.
</li><li> The children's picture book <em>How to Make an Apple Pie and See the World</em> sets up for an idea similar to the <em>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</em> books, but actually subverts this. The book begins with a trip to the store for ingredients for apple pie, only for the store to be closed, resulting in a journey around the world. At the end of the book, it's said that apple pie is good with ice cream, so you should go to the store for ice cream. But if the store is closed... you can eat it plain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeTo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeTo">Time To</a></em>: "Time to Pee!" ends with "At least, until you get that feeling again."

<ul><li> In "Godfrey and Zeke in: Lost Control", the eponymous zoo animals take a trip to the sewage treatment plant after Godfrey accidentally flushes their TV remote down the toilet. They have an exciting adventure getting it back, but just end up watching TV in a bored fashion after they do so.

After all is said and done, the two are then told that they must go back to Earth to retrieve more pizzas, much to Tad's dismay.

After a series of bad events and ultimately no money, Luther learns the hard way that the pearl is far more trouble than it's worth and tosses it back towards the ocean only for it to land in a fisherman's bucket. The fisherman ends up with both a treasure chest full of priceless objects and a huge object about to crush him.
