For example, this tends to manifest itself in Christian tracts with phrases such as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureBlind">Who's Jesus?</a>" If the unbeliever <em>has</em> heard of Jesus, they somehow haven't heard about the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">died on a cross for everyone's sins, came back to life three days later</a>" thing.

This trope is the idea that the opposition isn't <em>bad</em>; they merely picked up their philosophy without thinking of the <em>obviously</em> superior alternative. This may be a misguided attempt to make the opposing viewpoint more likable. After all, if they'd heard of Christianity, it means one of two things: either they'd already <em>be</em> a Christian, or they rejected it - which makes them irredeemably evil. Therefore the only good excuse is to somehow have never heard of it in the first place.
</p><p>Ironic in that while it may be an attempt to "soften the blow" of an attack on the opposition, members of the actual opposition may see it as even worse than just calling them "bad". At the very least, it's extremely patronizing. It's also worth noting that even if you think your alternative is superior and the people in question <em>hadn't</em> thought of it, they are very unlikely to just fall in line right away, or fall in at all for that matter; people very rarely change deeply held beliefs on a whim. Bad usage of this trope can fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy">False Dichotomy</a> territory by citing only few (usually two) possible views on the matter while ignoring / dismissing every remaining one.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">Chick Tracts</a></em>, the Christian protagonist will explain to a bunch of people about "the truth" â€” and, very soon, everyone will be quick to convert. The ease of a <em>Chick Tract</em> conversion is made even more baffling considering most of the converted have never heard of Jesus before, yet instantly comprehend evangelical terms like "washed in the blood" or "filled with the holy spirit" the moment they're spoken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant">instead of thinking</a> they mean "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath">bathing in human blood</a>," or "getting drunk on sacred distilled liquor."
<ul><li> The most well-known offender is probably <a class="urllink" href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0055/0055_01.asp">"Big Daddy,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which after citing scientific evidence of questionable strength against evolution,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07u7z');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07u7z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07u7z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the person that is cited for the arguments has been roundly criticized by other scientists as well as by <em>other creationists</em></span> <em>everyone</em> immediately agrees it's wrong. Even the biology teacher gives up teaching evolution. In the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1051/1051_01.asp">version for younger children,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Li'l Susy accuses her teacher of lying. Even if her teacher was wrong about evolution, she wouldn't be lying. She would simply be <em>mistaken</em>. Apparently, in Jack Chick's world, teachers who teach evolution are intentionally misleading children. Even Christians who believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsWrong">science is completely wrong about evolution</a> acknowledge this is really not the case.
</li><li> Witness this dialogue from <a class="urllink" href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0063/0063_01.asp">"The Little Princess":<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Believer:</strong> Mr. Spencer, I'm sure the thought of your daughter dying breaks your heart, right? <br/><strong>Unbeliever:</strong> <strong>Of course!</strong> <br/><strong>Believer:</strong> Well, God was <strong>even more</strong> heartbroken when He sent His Son from heaven to die on Earth. <br/><strong>Unbeliever:</strong> Why did God have to do <strong>THAT?</strong> <br/><strong>Believer:</strong> Because all people are sinners, and God would never allow sin to enter heaven. Because of our sin, we <strong>ALL</strong> deserve hell. The <strong>only</strong> way man could ever get into heaven was for someone sinless to die in his place and pay the penalty for his sin. <br/><strong>Unbeliever:</strong> Who could that be? <br/><strong>Believer:</strong> <strong>That someone was God the Son, Jesus Christ.</strong> <br/><strong>Unbeliever:</strong> You mean Jesus died for <strong>US!</strong>
</div><ul><li> There's also <a class="urllink" href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0042/0042_01.asp">"Allah Had No Son,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which a Muslim goes <em>within minutes</em> from threatening to kill the evangelist who calls Allah a Moon God to vowing to preach the Good News to other Muslims even at the cost of his own life.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1047/1047_01.asp?wpc=1047_01.asp&amp;wpp=a">Vampire Jesus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is even easier to convince, when he was ready to drink blood a frame earlier.
</li><li> In a tract about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">Christian Rock</a> being actually controlled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LouisCypher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LouisCypher">"Lew Siffer"</a>, one guy is converted in one panel by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality">reading a Chick tract</a>.
</li><li> Another tract involves two people talking about the creation story in Genesis. One argues that the "days" could have been any length of time to God. The other responds that the days <em>had</em> to have been twenty-four hour long days, because plants were made before the sun, and without sunlight, they would die ... easily convincing his friend with this argument. This is especially baffling if you've actually read the Bible. God creates day and night in Genesis 1:3-5 on the first day, then creates plant life in Genesis 1:11, on the third day (and created light before there even were days, for that matter).
</li><li> In one tract a guy who <em>just</em> converted somehow manages (off panel) to convert 28 people at his first Bible study meeting. Why so many non-believers were attending a Bible study is left unexplained.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0036/0036_01.asp">The Bull<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is a particularly impressive example. The titular prisoner, who rules over his prison with an iron fist, is put into solitary after killing three prisoners in a single night (and at least one two weeks beforehand; it's implied he may have killed more in the meantime). In the solitary room there is a tract reading "Somebody Loves Me". He immediately dismisses it, but within two hours he is so convinced that he requests a Bible and a chaplain visit. By the time the chaplain shows up two days later, "The Bull" is not only more knowledgeable about it than this man who has dedicated his life to it (or at least the parts about Jesus' love and Hell; he only "just found out that God hates sodomy") but he also devoutly believes every word of it. Then, he proceeds to easily evangelize the chaplain, the entire population of prisoners, the guards, and the warden. Quite literally the only character who isn't easily evangelized is the state governor, whose only role in the comic is to be a jerk to everybody for no reason. All this is particularly strange given that 1) since Bull found the tract in solitary it must have been put there by one of the prison staff, yet <em>none</em> of them are Christians, and 2) Â“Somebody Loves MeÂ” <em>doesnÂ’t even discuss Christian doctrine</em>.
</li><li> This is surprisingly often averted in tracts in which the listener refuses or is hesitant to commit to converting, and then dies and goes to hell. Then again, not only are most of the successful conversions fairly easy, but it's typically implied that nothing the Christian said could have converted the listener, making them lost causes from the start.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1xo08');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1xo08" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1xo08');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It seems likely that Chick subscribes to the original Calvinist view that God has actively chosen some people for damnation as well as for salvation: those who are to be damned are immune to evangelism, while those who are to be saved have their hearts opened by God at the right moment.</span>

Sure, one of the main subplots involves an atheist converting to Christianity, but that plays out about as realistically as allowed by a story with a literal alien Jesus. However, late in the story, an invasion of cat-monsters and a one-liner is all it takes to convert Pastor Ong from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a> to a more pragmatic stance.

</div></li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rius">Rius</a></em> comic features this: a journalist arrives to the town asking to interview God. He asks several people, including devout believers, but their answers confuse him even more. Then he asks the priest, who redirects him to church doctrine and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>. He answers that he has read all those and what he wants is to directly interview God and ask him questions, like when He was born, what are His favorite activities, and so on. Finally he asks the town atheist, who easily converts him to atheism.
</li><li> In the first arc of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen">Ultimate X-Men</a></em> comic by Mark Millar, Wolverine joins the X-Men under false pretenses, actually intending to infiltrate and kill Xavier per Magneto's instructions. After meeting Jean Grey and sleeping with her a few times, he tells her that he had intended to kill Xavier but that Xavier had turned him around to the X-Men's way of thinking. This is not another ruse â€” apparently, with absolutely no event to give Wolverine such an epiphany, he's suddenly playing for the home team. Given the fact that Charles Xavier, the world's most powerful telepath, is involved, Easy Evangelism seems a lot more plausible. Or he just decided that Jean's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperPower">personality</a> was worth it.

<ul><li> <em>100 Girls</em> has a particularly odd scene where a man gives a 30 second speech where he manages to show he isn't familiar with the first thing about feminist theory, at the same time as convincing a gender studies class that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminist</a>-like feminism is pointless.
</li></ul><ul><li> The ending scene of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator">The Great Dictator</a></em> has the lead good guy, who is posing as <strike>Hitler</strike> Hynkel, give a speech that we are to suppose makes everything okay. It appears to some people that the speech at the end of <em>The Great Dictator</em> was clearly by Chaplin, more than by the character. It probably wasn't made to be realistic so much as to get the speech across, and it was a pretty brilliant speech, if mostly or entirely rhetorical. Slavoj Zizek points out to the fact that the public is cheering in the same way they would have cheered <strike>Hitler</strike> Hynkel. The point is that the audience isn't listening; they're just hearing their leader. Indeed, Chaplin is speaking to the film audience, not the audience IN the film. Footage was shot for an extended ending, where you see the soldiers cheer the speech, throw down their guns and start dancing with each other. <em>The Great Dictator</em> was shot in 1940-41, in a period when Allied suspicions about the extent of the Holocaust were growing. The heartfelt appeal of the final speech has more to do with the way Chaplin felt as the film was wrapping up than how he felt starting the project off.

<ul><li> When Hedwig listens to the radio together with their mother and the presenter talks about Jesus the mother turns it off.

</li><li> Later on Hedwig talks to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> later to be Tommy Gnosis</span>. He said to Hedwig (in a similar way of absolute seriousness) something like "Did you accept Jesus Christ as your savior?" - just to explain immediately that Jesus died to protect the people <em>from</em> God - who was so cruel that he expelled Adam and Eve from paradise for wanting knowledge about what was wrong and what was right.

By that same token, however, the "on the street interviews" shown over the credits are also incredibly critical of the brothers, responses ranging from with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> moments to flat out calls for their arrest, and only one guy really takes their side (they also are wanted fugitives by that point for this, so obviously the government hasn't been persuaded).

After our lumpy hero Gilbert is shown all the wonderful everyday uses for springs, he spends the remainder of the short explaining said uses to his golfing buddies.

Obviously this is necessary to move the story along at a fast pace. Luke's "conversion" is arguably justified by the fact that he witnesses Kenobi using the Force, and then is able to feel it himself. It is notable that Han is depicted as being something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a> simply because he does not immediately buy into all of this based solely on Obi-Wan's pedantic ramblings and Luke being able to deflect a few stun shots after hours of practice. Although he comes across as rather less reasonable when the prequels revealed that the rise of the Empire was a much shorter time ago than was apparent in the original trilogy, and Han would have seen the golden age of the Jedi during his childhood. On the other hand, the ratio of non-Force sensitives to Jedi in the Old Republic was apparently <em>billions</em>-to-one! An average person in the galaxy would likely never meet a Jedi during their lifetime or personally witness actual usage of Force powers. This was especially true since the Jedi largely limited their socialization to within their own Order and had little or no contact with their families. Thus it would be very easy for someone to believe that the Jedi were over-hyped and that the Force was just a lot of "simple tricks and nonsense".

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarquisDeSade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarquisDeSade">Marquis de Sade</a> actually managed an atheist version of this in his tract <em>Philosophy in the Bedroom</em>. It follows a teenage girl whose father has sent her to be "re-educated" by sexually depraved adults whose goal is to make her abandon her obedient, submissive upbringing to become a ruthless libertine who will stop at nothing to experience pleasure. Surely such deeply engrained traditional values would take at least <em>years</em> to undo, right? Wrong. It takes her <em>two days</em> to decide her old way of life was completely hokey. Sade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">kind of admits</a> her conversion process was rather quick in his introduction, but points out that it's because he wants others to do as she did, and as quickly. He <em>hated</em> religion and anything else he saw as impeding humanity's goal of experiencing pleasure, and so wrote the book to motivate people to revolt against traditional values as quickly as possible.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorHugo">Victor Hugo</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les MisÃ©rables</a></em>, the Bishop of Digne, whose whole family was wiped out by the original French Revolution, gets into a debate with a poor zealot of that same revolution on his deathbed. The Bishop, there to administer a final blessing, is at first cold towards the man, and at the end of the debate is on his <em>knees</em> asking for the revolutionary's blessing. The Bishop might be excused on account of "not having heard the other side of the story", but he <em>clearly</em> loves his poor parishioners and has turned down a life of wealth on their account. Also, a traditional 19th-century Catholic coming to like the French Revolution is roughly equivalent to a patriotic American supporting monarchism; itÂ’s just not done. Slightly different in that the revolutionary was not involved in the worst of the excesses, and it's more a case of the bishop learning not to judge people on hearsay.
</li><li> Scott Adams of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em> fame wrote a book called <em>God's Debris: A Thought Experiment</em> in which the protagonist (the Avatar) advocates a flavor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pandeism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pandeism">Pandeism</a> (in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> blew himself up to become the universe). Easy Evangelism comes into play with the sequel to this book, <em>The Religion Wars</em>, in which a <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">simplified</a> world war between Christians and Muslims takes place in contemporary times. The Avatar ends the war with a simple phrase: "If God is so smart, why do you fart?" Everyone on Earth practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">Contemplates Their Navels</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions">Outgrows Their Silly Superstitions</a> overnight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em>:
<ul><li> Used in <em>Faith of the Fallen</em>. People are shown the light by a pretty statue, of two people standing tall, because no subject in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> seems to do that, along with the inscription "Your life is your own...", because no one in the empire seemed to have even thought of that. An alternative reading is that <em>everyone</em> had thought of it, or wanted to think of it, but they were so beaten down by the dystopia that they'd never dare say such things aloud before (the blacksmith and others admit as much in private earlier in the book). And seeing it displayed so openly and <em>proudly</em> finally convinced them to act on it. An ability to convince people is often stated to be a common trait to people who have the gift. Richard Rahl-Sue is the most gifted wizard ever. And the statue was implied to be at least in part a creation of magic.
</li><li> Again in <em>Naked Empire</em>, where Richard easily manages to show a bunch of pacifists that their view is wrong. Not only that, but he can get them to take up arms with no compunctions, despite it going against what they were told all of their lives. It can't be explained by magic here, since Richard's gift was explicitly not working at the time. It helps that they had already been wavering about their pacifism when faced with the Imperial Order ravaging them, but even so.

As the blogger, Fred Clark, points out, not only do they never make use of the incredibly obvious miracles that have already happened, they also never make use of the ability to predict future events their particular biblical exegesis grants them. Nobody ever says "Looks like you're not ready to believe yet. Here, take my card, and if after the unscheduled solar eclipse next Tuesday you find yourself a bit more open minded, give me a call".
</li><li> In <em>Kingdom Come</em>, it's pretty easy for the believers in the Millennial Kingdom to evangelize the message of Jesus Christ being the only way to salvation, given that (1) God and Jesus Christ are real, and (2) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathsHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathsHourglass">any "natural" who remains an unbeliever by the time they reach 100 years of age will instantly die and go to Hell.</a> It's the Other Light faction that has to work hard to convince people of their beliefs.

However, it doesn't extend to his followers, who seem genuinely surprised that people who read his (less-than-well-written) book and have his extremist views explained don't convert on the spot (it's a psychic effect, they undergo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DispelMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DispelMagic">Dispel Magic</a> is used).

And apparently all it takes to call it all off is for the woman to tell everyone off camera that it was all a mistake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em> had the episode "Choir Trouble" where the previously non-religious Steve Urkel joins the Winslows' church, reveals he had simply never known about religion, and converts to Christianity, all in a single day. This is particularly unbelievable because before and after this, Steve generally knew everything there is to know. To make things even worse, despite being a science geek, Steve proceeded to explain his newfound faith with an analogy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">so scientifically inaccurate</a> that Richard Feynman must have been turning in his grave. Thankfully, after the initial preachiness, this is mainly used just to set up a plot where Steve tries to get on the church choir with the Winslows despite his nasal voice and lack of singing ability; afterward, Steve's religion was generally only brought up during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episodes</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in some episodes, notably in "Guerilla My Dreams", where Hawkeye and co. try their hardest to save a captured woman from the South Korean agent who suspects her of being a communist guerrilla and is bringing her in to be tortured and executed after she is healed. At the end, the agent stands there and translates what the woman says at the surgeons.
<div class="indent"><strong>South Korean agent:</strong> She says: You save lives of those who kill my people and rape my land. I would kill you as I tried to kill my enemy in your hospital. As I would kill this murderer, I would gladly die if I could kill but one of you.
</div></li><li> Hawkeye and co. still don't take it well, even after what the guerrilla says, but it definitely shows that his view isn't necessarily the correct one. Given his reactions, it is also entirely possible that Hawkeye didn't care whether or not the woman was a guerilla, but rather that he was just disgusted at the whole situation, i.e. being asked to patch someone up just to have them be executed later. That didn't go over well with him previously, when Colonel Flagg did something similar.

He comes out feeling "young again-a man of eighty".

Dylan Hunt (flung into a future that doesn't follow his Star Trek-ian ideals) asks the crew to join him later for a discussion. The characters say they don't want to come if he's going to try to get them to join his cause. He promises them that he won't do that, but as soon as they show up, that's exactly what he does. None of the other characters call him on this lie, and in fact they all do agree to help him change the entire universe to his way of thinking by the time he's done with his mealy-mouthed speech. It helps that this is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">crapsack universe</a> that living on the <em>Andromeda</em>, even piloted by an idealist on a hopeless suicidal quest, makes for a <em>serious</em> quality-of-life improvement for these people.

A variant also can occur, where after the filibuster the character who has been arguing may smile knowingly and say "Okay," suggesting that they agreed with the character all along but kept the argument going for some reason of their own (however obscure at times). The show actually has very few instances of this actually <em>working</em> on someone though. Most politicians subjected to the main characters' logic came back with the argument that although they understood the merit of the main characters' argument, they still disagreed about its importance and/or thought the cons outweighed the pros (e.g. Ainsley telling Sam, after he makes fun of her for being against the Equal Rights Amendment, that all her rights are enumerated in the 14th Amendment and she doesn't need a bunch of "old white men" to hand down redundant laws reaffirming her equality.)

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> in the Old Testament, of all placesâ€”more specifically, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus">Book of Exodus</a>. In spite of being the chosen people of God, and receiving multiple proofs of divine support (such as the Red Sea parting and later swallowing a hostile army, food falling from the sky, and rocks in the middle of the desert spouting water), the people of Israel cannot be content with worshiping God, and in the end try to make their own. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Aaron</a> claimed it was meant to be an idol to the Lord, but considering their flagrant disregard for morality (they "sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualEuphemism">play</a>") and the fact that at least three thousand men refused to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineInTheSand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineInTheSand">come to Moses to stand for the Lord</a> (since three thousand were subsequently killed), this seems like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">a flimsy justification</a>.
</li><li> After King David, the Jews repeatedly "did evil in the eyes of the Lord." Kings and Chronicles both mention idolatry as a particular vice of the Jews. God was pretty swift in kicking the Jews in the butt for this, but apparently they were only easily evangelized in one direction. All through the Old Testament, the Jews would be wandering around the desert for a little while, conquering people, and just lapse out of nowhere into worshiping Baal or the rest of the Canaanite religion. That is, they only worshiped God in times of distress as is common with most people, but during times of ease and comfort lapsed into idolatry. Some historians believe this was due to the Hebrews originally worshiping many gods, and slowly transforming to followers of just Yahweh over time. This has been hypothesized as an explanation for the First Commandment, which says they should have no other gods <em>before</em> Yahweh, implying (according to the theory, anyway) not only that they believed the other gods existed, but that it was okay to worship them if he were considered first.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfJonah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfJonah">Book of Jonah</a> highlights Israel's unfaithfulness by contrasting it with the Gentiles' quick conversion. The sailors headed for Tarshish immediately show respect for Jonah's god when they see how powerful he is, and the Ninehvites don't even need to see a miracle: they rush to repent the moment they hear Jonah's warning. Jonah himself is actually <em>disappointed</em> with how easily they convert; he apparently was hoping to see Nineveh nuked by divine wrath. The story ends with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> lecture from God himself.
</li><li> Jesus himself also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">averted</a> this in the New Testament. Even though performing miracles is hard to argue with, the general public often didn't agree with him. True, there were huge crowds who listened to him, but there were also a lot of skeptics too. This included the Pharisees and some crowd members who doubted him or believed he was demon-possessed. By the end, most of them left him to be crucified. Although, there were apparently a lot of "miracle workers" in those days, and many of them probably <em>were</em> demon-possessed, insane and/or outright frauds.
</li><li> What drove people away was that Jesus kept telling people that he wasn't going to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">Rebel Leader</a> they were looking for. Even most of his disciples left (except the original Twelve) when he talked about believers "eating [his] flesh and drinking [his] blood"; not just because they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicked</a> out by the idea, but because it was a clear statement that he was going to die, which the Messiah wasn't supposed to do. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Deconstructed</a> specifically by Jesus in the parable of the sower. In the story, some people simply refuse to hear the message, while others happily respond right away only to give up just as quickly when the going gets tough. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">The moral of the story is</a> that real faith requires a solid foundation and genuine understanding, and will truly endure the trials to come.
</li><li> A straight example would be the Ethiopian Eunuch in The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ActsOfTheApostles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ActsOfTheApostles">Acts of the Apostles</a> who asks Philip who a passage in the Bible referred to, is told about Jesus, asks "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?" and becomes a Christian on the spot.
</li><li> There's also Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost, which, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">the power of the Holy Spirit</a>, results in several thousand people converting then and there.
</li><li> Paul had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">more mixed results</a> in his preaching to the Gentiles. After his sermon to the philosophers in Athens, much of the crowd is divided on the idea of the Resurrection. Some jeer at it, others are interested in hearing more about it some other time, and some believe in the message. Then there was the time he and Barnabas performed a miracle in a Greek city, only for the locals to conclude that they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith">incarnations of Zeus and Hermes</a>.
</li><li> Averted when Paul speaks in his own defense before King Agrippa and concludes by asking the King if he is ready to believe, to which Agrippa mockingly responds, "In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?"
</li></ul></li><li> Because of the many precedents, Mohammed outright refused to ask God for any miracles to prove to the crowds that he was a true prophet. Other prophets had done it before, and the people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">never believed them</a>. However, easy evangelism does show up in at least <a class="urllink" href="https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-4/Book-55/Hadith-546/">one hadith<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Mohammed makes an easy convert of someone who came and asked him three questions he felt only a prophet would know the answers to; upon merely hearing Mohammed's response to each of them, the man converts to Islam. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> at least, as he clearly had criteria laid out for what would convince him, and then accepted the answer which in his view fulfilled them. However, the Jews who heard of his conversion flatly rejected this, despite him formerly being the most respected and wisest among them.
</li><li> There is a Jewish legend about some relative of the Roman Emperor who converted to Judaism and decided to live in Israel. The Emperor sent three battalions to bring him back. All three chose to stay.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalmud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalmud">The Talmud</a>, tractate <em>Shabbat</em>, a gentile comes to Hillel and says that he will convert to Judaism if Hillel can teach him the entire Torah while he is standing on one foot. Hillel replies, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule">That which is hateful to yourself do not do to another</a>, that is the whole of Torah and the rest is but commentary." The man converted.

Many, <em>many</em> characters convert over the course of the series, but the only truly straight example of the trope in the show's history was Katrina, who discovered Christianity at the beginning of one episode and was a convert before that same episode's halfway point. The show generally takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a> approach, and most conversions come at the end of a lengthy soul-searching story arc, with the longest being those of Connie and Eugene, two of the show's three <em>main characters</em>, who spent a good portion of the series as agnostics but were never depicted unsympathetically for it. To top it off, one episode was about how evangelism <em>isn't</em> easy.

If you accept a small penalty, the same can be accomplished in 6 seconds. In epic levels, they add the fanatic state of mind, allowing a skillful enough speaker to cause a hostile army into a band of fanatic followers willing to die for you in one combat round.
</li><li> There is a known character build that eventually results in being able to substitute any other skill for a Diplomacy check. Combine this with the Jumplomancer build which raises your Jump skill to obscene levels and you can instantly turn an army of enemies in frothing fanatics by jumping really high. Easy Evangelism indeed.
</li><li> The spell <em>Enthrall</em>, in its 1st and 2nd Edition versions, allowed priests to invoke this trope on NPCs by preaching to crowds. Listeners who failed their save enough times could be converted to the speaker's faith, even if they'd been devout followers of other deities.
</li><li> Similarly, in 3rd edition, the result of a failing to resist the "bluff" skill was that the target actually believed the claim. This wouldn't have been a huge problem, since the penalties and bonuses make truly ridiculous claims almost impossible to pull off, save for a potion called "glibness" which made it literally impossible to fail a bluff check against the vast majority of targets. This meant that you could tell people that they'd been a life-long follower of whatever and, following a six-second one-liner, they'd automatically believe you. The rules for the skill, however, do specify that this belief only persists for "at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less)."
</li><li> The <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> gives rules by which you can convert an enemy from their starting alignment towards Good â€” and they avert the trope, because it takes a <em>great</em> deal of effort.

None of that is enough to turn Horus â€” instead, it takes a single vision of a possible future from the Chaos Gods (posing as one of his closest friends), and he instantly sets off to murder his father and destroy the Imperium. <br/><br/>Granted, that vision also exploited a great deal of his personal resentment of the Emperor for stealing credit for his victories and the incredible stress from coordinating and leading dozens of military campaigns. And to make it worse, that vision was of the 40K universe after his heresy (it was the world if the emperor lived, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">no-one said anything about moving around</a> and to be fair, it <em>was</em> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld">Crapsack World</a> the like of which is rarely matched, where men die in the billions and everyone worships the guy he's convinced he needs to kill.

Socially-focused characters can sway their enemies to their side with relative ease â€” a devout member of the Immaculate Faith with average Conviction takes only two scenes of argument to convert from "kill the Anathema" to "yay Solars" â€” and Presence 5 is spelled out as being skilled enough to convert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">a member of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Wyld Hunt</a> to the worship of the Unconquered Sun. <em>But.</em> Most characters who can do this are in fact using Charms that produce unnatural mental influence, or in plain English, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>.

Because a target's Conviction stat determines how easily they're swayed to a new cause, those weak-willed NPCs (Conviction 1) that you talked into joining you with one amazing speech can just as easily be talked out of it by anyone else's speech. The reliable converts are the ones you can't win easily.

<ul><li> Some religious plays have this trope. Say perhaps (in the play), there is a man at an inn. Another character comes by holding any sort of religious text, and finds the man does not subscribe to their religion. The second character eagerly lends their religious text to the man, and one scene later, the man has suddenly become the same religion as the latter character. This could be excused by how media compress long periods time into small bits, however. But when it's explicitly stated that the time lapse is quite short, it is definitely this trope.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Godspell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Godspell">Godspell</a></em>, right after many different philosophers have just finished singing their creeds (including Sarte, who claims to represent "atheistic existentialism"), John the Baptist appears to sing "Prepare Ye".

The public buys into this. They leave Mark Antony to give a speech to the people of Rome. He pretends to be praising the conspirators, but subtly turns around the people's opinions in a 180 to the point they start mobbing the city in search of the conspirators. <br/><br/>Caesar was already a popular guy, so the crowd may have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowderKegCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowderKegCrowd">ripe to be converted</a> before Marc Antony even started. Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">justified</a> as Mark Antony was known to have been a very skilled orator and takes his time winning over the crowd, including reading parts of Caesar's will where Caesar left a whole bunch of money and land to the people of Rome. Bribes can be very helpful when persuading people. <br/><br/>It should also be added that they are both very good speeches used as examples of rhetoric even today. We are talking about Shakespeare at his very best after all. Explained a bit better in the historical case which this was based off: Brutus spoke to the Senate, who generally feared the dictator for life, while Mark Antony spoke at Caesar's funeral, mostly to Caesar's veteran soldiers who held a personal loyalty to him. A riot ensued, with some conspirators killed and the others chased out of Rome.

In the first Babylonian mission in the original game, "Holy Man," you must use one to convert some enemy villagers in order to establish your own village.

</li><li> Used to creepy effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em>. The intercom system randomly blares out propaganda which takes the form of a man convincing a woman that her fears and doubts about Rapture (not <em>the</em> Rapture, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum">Psycho Serum</a>-addled undersea <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopia</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">sharing that name</a> in which the game takes place) are unfounded. Fears and doubts such as "There's too much capital punishment." and "I've been suffering headaches and strange hallucinations ever since I started splicing."
</li><li> Propaganda works this way in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a></em>. A planet being hit with enemy propaganda may revolt, which somehow results in it becoming uninhabited again. The same thing happens when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Advent</a> fire their Deliverance Engine at a planet.

</li><li> The Qunari in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> are shockingly successful at acquiring converts. Even the Qunari are surprised. The group in Kirkwall is composed entirely of soldiers, and they aren't actively evangelizing at all since there is an entire separate caste dedicated to that. It should be noted that most converts are elves, usually treated like second class citizens even by the religious authorities. It's understandable that they would see idea of joining the Qun, which promises everyone complete equality, as compelling. To put it in context, city-dwelling elves in the Dragon Age setting are treated similar to the way Jewish people were treated in Medieval Europe, except that they follow the same religion as everyone else.

</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-Zagging Trope</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis">Europa Universalis</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played straight if the province you want to convert is of the Animist, Totemist and Shamanist faiths, who have a natural +2% conversion power to those converting them. There are also events where a nation which holds Animist, Totemist or Shamanist beliefs can be made into another religion entirely, where a nation westernizing comes to identify more strongly with their western neighbours, and following their religion too.
</li><li> Some modifiers also allow for a much easier conversion, such as being a pious Muslim, being an Orthodox nation with a high patriarchal authority, having the right national ideas, having an inquisitor court adviser, or by being a Muslim nation and trying to convert another branch of Islam to your own. Because of this, a pious Najd with the Religious ideas group and an inquisitor in court has a very easy time of converting others, with an 13% bonus from those four modifiers, and 15% against Animist, Totemist, Shamanist, Shiite and Ibadi provinces.
</li><li> This can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">Exaggerated</a> by nations who convert to Protestantism or Reformed/Calvinism theology, who have a very strong national modifier which aids their peoples' conversion from Catholicism to their new religion, and with the Church Power mechanic a Protestant nation can be made even stronger. Both Reformed and Protestant nations can also spawn a 'Centre of Reformation' which causes one province to spread its new religion to others, without any input from the nation itself. This can soon make quick work of a once catholic nation, turning them entirely protestant within a matter of a few short years.
</li><li> But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> if the province you want to convert is Muslim, Shinto, Coptic or Orthodox as you get a negative modifier to conversion power, and the higher the base tax rate of the province, the harder it is to convert.
</li><li> Some modifiers for each province will also make converting a province very hard, if not impossible. Having a non-accepted culture<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qgjc');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qgjc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qgjc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Such as being a Westphalian nation trying to convert a Turkish province</span>, having had a recent religious revolt, being sieged by religious rebels or having already recently converted will add a large negative modifier to a province, adding quite some difficulty.
</li><li> Rome, Mecca and where Sikhism first appears also have a very strong negative modifier to conversion power, making a well developed Mecca or Rome nearly if not entirely impossible to convert. This particularly hits Byzantium hard, as restoring the Pentarchy requires Rome to be Orthodox, which will only be made harder if Rome revolts with religious rebels.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> often has religion work out to "Whoever sent a missionary to a city last wins". The fifth game makes things a little more reasonable: proximity to a city following a certain religion will cause a city's population to slowly convert over time, a process that can be sped up by sending missionaries, but unless you send <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">inquisitors</a>, believers in other faiths don't just disappear (a city's "religion" is whichever one is believed by <em>more than half</em> the population). Still played straight with Great Prophets, which can automatically convert a city's entire population with no other faiths allowed.

It doesn't help that she barely listens to him. The whole scene might be justified, though, as Custodian's flashback and shorthand to the real story. It's also all but stated that she literally gets off out of religious ecstasy on being in the Emperor's presence, and so just accepts whatever His spokesman tells her afterwards without question (both the Custodian and the Emperor are creeped out by this even centuries later).

The player has the abused PokÃ©mon fight the people who hurt them (yes, the trainers, not their PokÃ©mon). When you win a battle, the PokÃ©mon talk to the person, giving a rather trite lecture on the error of their ways.

When a video is titled as such, it's almost guaranteed the "destroying argument" is an incredibly common one. For example, "destroying" Christianity by bringing up the Problem of Evil ("If God is good, why do bad things happen?"), which is something every Christian will have to deal with on their own before adulthood (or very shortly after conversion, for those not born into the religion).

He says he was a longtime staunch Republican and enthusiastic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">Bush</a> supporter before hearing this one interview four and a half years after 9/11 converted him to full-blown Trutherdom.
</li><li> There are cases of this in other religions as well; for example, one common evangelical Christian rebuttal to claims that their religion can't be universally appealing if people left from it is that those people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">must not have been truly saved</a>.
</li><li> It's very hard to gauge how true these sorts of things are, but most major religions with missionary traditions have stories of whole nations being converted practically overnight, usually due to their leader's righteous conversion.
<ul><li> In the words of a Russian historian, after the Prince of Kiev converted to Christianity (paraphrasing), "All the people celebrated the wonderful decision of their prince for they said unto themselves, 'why would our leaders choose for themselves something that was not good for us also.'

This occurs mostly in fable, obviously. Take into account that one of the tenets of Buddhism is that said gods, monsters, and demons are also trapped in the cycle of reincarnation and Buddhism is a means to achieve Nirvana.
</li><li> A Catholic example exists in the Story of Our Lady of Guadelupe. Long story short, after all was said and done an entire nation of natives converted to Catholicism. This is less impressive given that it was a population in a Catholic-dominated nation at the time and the natives weren't exactly unfamiliar with Catholicism to begin with.

</li><li> This tends to happen with a lot of cults, as the leaders are often extremely charismatic. The real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchOfHappyology">Church of Happyology</a> is another good example; there isn't a flood of how bad their deeds are, just the ones brought forth by word of mouth, because infiltrators either get brainwashed and converted, or sued into silence.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Marxist</a> theory, when the working classes attain "class consciousness," in other words, realize how they're being exploited by the Bourgeoisie, they'll rise up and overthrow the capitalists. Those who don't have "false consciousness." They may still rise up, but not against the material conditions which created their misery in the first place, like in the Protestant Reformation, where the people "liberated" themselves from the Catholic Church, but not their feudal lords (a peasants' revolt in Germany occurred, but was suppressed).
</li><li> EWTN, a Catholic TV/radio network, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averts</a> this trope. When they have guest speakers talk about their conversion to Catholicism, there's usually at least a 3-5 year span from the first inkling of curiosity to baptism, with that time being taken up in Bible reading, prayer, and discussing their numerous objections and questions with other people. Reverts (people who leave the Church, then come back), often take decades of questioning and exploring before coming back.
</li><li> While most missionaries don't see success come as easily as the ones who went to the tribe that was waiting for brothers to bring them a book with the secret to eternal happiness, Christianity has been known to grow rapidly in places where people genuinely are hearing about Jesus for the first time. Christianity had been in China since before it came into Europe (no kidding - look up the Nestorian Christians) but Christian teachings were largely wiped out from Central Asia and China after the coming of Islam, and Christianity had to be reintroduced in the form of Roman Catholicism with the coming of the Portuguese in the 17th century. It was repressed a couple of times after that, but there are still more Christians in China than there are members of the Communist Party.
</li><li> Averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Judaism</a>. While it <em>is</em> possible to convert to Judaism and many people have done so, it requires at the very least being told "no" by a Rabbi several times, <em>before</em> the "fun" part begins-learning Hebrew and reading the Torah to fully understand Judaism, and only <em>then</em> can you convert and (if male) get circumcised. Fast learners are said to have done the whole thing in a year, but that does of course not count the time they spent curious and <em>wishing</em> to convert.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">Mormon</a> missionary culture, this is known as finding the "Golden Investigator", usually somebody who is excited to learn from the missionaries, loves reading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfMormon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfMormon">The Book of Mormon</a>, enjoys going to church, and who can't wait to get baptized.
