While characters generally gain in power as they gain levels, not all levels are created equal. Sometimes you get a major new ability that makes the game easy. Or you might end up just gaining some small stat increase or a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> for that level. But hey, at least it's something, right?
</p><p>But wait a minute! Those added hit points don't even add up to surviving one more hit from my enemies.

<ul><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em>, all you gained from a level-up was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpFillUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpFillUp">Level-Up Fill-Up</a> and 5 stat points. Your actual damage and survivability were almost entirely based on items and spell levels; the best items could be worn at about 100 Strength (out of 255), stat points could be purchased and spells could be boosted by Enchanted Shrines. Not to mention that most utility spells stopped improving at spell level 7, despite having a spell level cap of 15. Mana Shield stopped improving at level 1 and the only reason to take it any higher was to prevent it from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">lowered to 0</a>.
</li><li> Casters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>. You can learn any spell between level 1 and 30 (out of 99). You can max it 20 levels later. You don't need more than one spell to kill every monster in the game, unless you have the expansion, in which case you need one spell and a way to cheese past immunes. Items that increase spell power are few and far between, and until patch 1.10, most of the best items are actually fairly low level (without the expansion, every single unique can drop before level 30). Assuming you max a level 24 or 30 spell, you hit a hard cap about halfway through the middle difficulty level and all you get from level-ups after that is a few piddly points of health or perhaps 1 more spell level from a new item. Meanwhile the monsters do continue to get stronger. A later patch did make it so that putting skill points into other spells of the same type (fire/blizzard/lightning) also provided bonus to the other spells in the school. So the used spell could still continue to be raised once at cap by augmenting them with other spells.
</li><li> While the levels never become truly <em>empty</em>, the level progression toward the end of the level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">cap</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> increases your power much more slowly than in the beginning, culminating after you hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">70</a> and start unlocking "Paragon Levels", which give comparatively tiny bonuses that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twinking">apply to all characters on your account</a>. At this point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquipmentBasedProgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquipmentBasedProgression">Equipment-Based Progression</a> becomes the more efficient way of growing more powerful and the game becomes even more focused on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LootGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LootGrinding">Loot Grinding</a> than before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonSinker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonSinker">Dragon Sinker</a></em> has a combat system where using a move costs a <em>percentage</em> of your current HP or MP. Meaning that no matter how far you level up, moves drain you just as quickly as ever. In the case of health, levels still aren't useless, because more health still means you can take more hits; however, having more magic points just means that you'll need more expensive items if you want to recharge (and you have slightly more resistance to magic-draining enemies, but those are relatively uncommon).
</li><li> Leveling in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em> gives you a negligible HP boost and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem">stat point of your choice</a> which does make a difference, however, there's a cap to each stat (depending on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClassSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClassSystem">character's class</a>, and including the ultimate classes), meaning that if you're overleveled your new levels go towards improving not very useful stats, and eventually doesn't improve any stat at all, only getting you the aforementioned negligible HP boost.
</li><li> Leveling the Tech skill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegatagmensionBlancPlusNeptuneVSZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegatagmensionBlancPlusNeptuneVSZombies">Megatagmension Blanc Plus Neptune VS Zombies</a></em> only gets you a new combo every other level.
</li><li> Your squad mates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> max out their skills at level 53. You max out your stats (and equipment) at level 80. The actual level cap is 132, and the game implements <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiddleEarthShadowOfWar">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a></em> has a skill system where you can only really spend two points on an ability at a time - one to unlock it, and one on a selection of mutually exclusive upgrades, some of which are of severely limited usefulness. Once you've unlocked all the skills and all the upgrades you want - which you can do as early as level thirty if you do the sidequests - your power is based entirely around the equipment and orcs you acquire, and each level becomes just the arbitrary ceiling of your orcs' power.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection">Kantai Collection</a></em>, leveling up only boosts your girls' antisubmarine warfare, evasion and accuracy stats. It does nothing for HP or the other stats, which can only be raised by modernisation and remodelling. Given that the entire game is one big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>, it's possible for a team of level 90-somethings to struggle with a map that a much lower-level team manage to beat.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    First Person Shooter </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Payday2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Payday2">Payday 2</a></em> uses an "Infamy" system that functions like the prestige system in other shooters. What differentiates it is that each Infamy level allows you to unlock an "Infamous" skill. On the second through fifth Infamy levels, these grant tangible uses by lowering skill investment costs on two skill trees of the player's choice (although the Fugitive tree is always one of the two, and the bonuses to that tree don't stack with future Infamy levels) as well as give a modest increase to exp gained. All the rest (the first and the 20 later-added levels of infamy) only grant a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">unique mask</a> and some exp, or just a flat exp boost. Since you have to be at level 100 to go infamous, this means that every other infamy level past 5 is essentially there only to make farming more infamy levels easier.
<ul><li> Before a massive overhaul of the skill system with the 100th update, the skill trees had this sort of issue, too. Early skills ostensibly had an advantage over later skills in that they didn't cost as much to unlock, but that was typically where the advantage ended - at <em>best</em> a skill would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> that required it to be aced before it would really be of any use, but it was far more likely for a skill to just be complete garbage that you'd only take because you need to progress along that part of the tree to unlock the actually useful skills. Worse as well is that before the overhaul, gaining/upgrading skills <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock">also had an in-game monetary cost on top of the skill point requirement</a> - even if you'd removed a skill and were reusing the points elsewhere - which discouraged experimentation and encouraged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome">following the leader</a>. After the overhaul this has mostly been fixed - the money requirement for gaining/upgrading a skill was removed, and many of the old early skills that actually had any use have been made inherent abilities, with replacement skills for the beginning of the skill trees actually being worth using on their own.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon">Ghost Recon</a></em> has a form of this with its minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements">RPG Elements</a>. Every soldier has four stats, one of which can be upgraded if the soldier in question participates in and survives a mission. The Leadership stat, when sufficiently leveled, gives every soldier in the squadron a bonus point in every other stat. The problem here is that you need three points in Leadership to get the bonus. Moreover, each stat maxes out at 8 points, meaning you can only get the bonus twice from a single soldier before any further points put into Leadership will be completely wasted. Not to mention as well that only the soldier with the highest Leadership will actually apply that bonus to the rest of the squad. Even the developers realized this, with some particular late-game specialists in the expansions having straight 7s or 8s across all their stats... except for Leadership, which they only get 6 in.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    MMORPGs </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> (and, by extension, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains">City of Villains</a></em>), this basically happens every 5 levels. Rather than having actual equipment, you slot your powers with 'upgrades', each of which has its own level. You can equip enhancements that are as much as 3 levels higher than your own level, which makes their effect greater - it then decreases as you level up, while they remain static. When their level becomes lower than yours, they begin to lose their effect. Enhancements of every level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a>, but rarely the exact type YOU need. And the stores only sell enhancements with levels divisible by 5. The end result is that you're at your strongest when your level ends with 3 or 8 (since enhancements have a chance to merge for a +1 level bonus), and then steadily become weaker as you level up, until you're able to buy your NEXT set of upgrades... putting you back at roughly the same level of strength you were at 5 levels ago. Fortunately, this has largely been superseded by the addition of craftable Invention Origin Enhancements, which don't degrade (instead, higher levels ones are stronger).
<ul><li> A more conventional use of the trope is the way that some levels provide a new power choice, while others only provide you with a few enhancement slots. While enhancements are the key to building a truly powerful character, these levels are rather less interesting - especially at lower levels, when the only available enhancements are rather weak, or higher levels, when all of the most important powers will already be fully slotted.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em> suffers from this as when you gain levels, you have to fight tougher monsters to gain experience. However, something called Alternate Advancement (AA) points can make a big difference in your power, and you can earn them at the lower levels. So gaining levels actually can make it harder to earn AA points. It is also the case that as players get more powerful, they also get more specialized, so that the steel armored warrior has a much greater defense proportionately at higher levels than the leather wearing druid. And since the monsters have to hit harder to be a challenge to the warrior, they now can kill the druid in just a few hits.
</li><li> Extremely common in Korean-styled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame">MMORPGs</a>, where leveling just gets you a couple stat points and a skill point, making the character only marginally better at most levels. Usually it's every 10 levels or so, when the next equipment set becomes available, that the characters actually make a significant advancement in strength. What this means is, as the enemies you are fighting start giving less experience, and you're forced to move on to stronger enemies, your character isn't meaningfully stronger until those key levels and the fights get harder.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TricksterOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TricksterOnline">Trickster Online</a></em>, a Korean MMORPG, has "hell levels." For each class they are slightly different. The toughest class to play is the Lion who uses firearms, because his hell levels start at level 1. The lion's gun damage is determined by the accuracy stat, while melee damage is given by the strength stat. Every character starts off weaponless, making the Lion's high accuracy useless and his low strength a huge liability. Until level 20 he is denied quality weapons, cannot use a shield, and cannot move while attacking. You're like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, except just glass and no cannon.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> has a fair bit of this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">Player Versus Player</a> combat, mainly only on Bounty Worlds. Leveling any combat skill raises your combat level, and since what level range of other players can attack you is a range from your own combat level, keeping your combat level as low as possible while maximizing your combat capability (by training certain combat skills more than others, in approximate order Str&gt;Atk&gt;Magic&gt;Prayer&gt;Ranged&gt;Hits&gt;Def) allows you to have an advantage over other players at the same combat level who have not focused on keeping their combat level low. Unfortunately for many would-be "Pro PKers", a vast majority of all active PKers between combat levels 20-110 (PKing unavailable below level 20, and at level 110-126 the only way to get combat levels at all is to max out those stats which increase combat level without boosting combat effectiveness all that much) have their stats set up in such a way to maximize Power-in-combat to Combat-level ratio. There is even a disclaimer in the website's FAQs stating that it is impossible to undo level-ups; once you have them, you're stuck with them for good. In addition, in the non-PvP portions of the game, new armour and weapons become usable at specific levels in specific skills, for example, the differences between level 80 attack (Chaotic Rapier) and level 79 attack (Still using Abyssal Whip) or level 70 attack (Can use Abyssal Whip) and level 69 attack (still using that oldschool Dragon weaponry) are far greater (in terms of how much it boosts your ability in combat) than any other single attack level-up.

<ul><li> Prior to several overhauls of character progression in the <em>Cataclysm</em> and <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> expansions, the talent trees normally just slightly improved a single skill with only a handful of new skills actually available. New skills from trainers had the same issue: Typically you'd just get a new rank to a spell, such as Shadowbolt 5 becoming Shadowbolt 6, which just let it keep up with what you were already doing. The newer system did away with spell ranks by having them scale based on stats and streamlined talents to always be a new spell or a new type of specialization.
</li><li> However, as more levels were added to the game and older, unused and useless skills were removed quicker than new ones were added, this trope became more and more of an issue until it reached a point in the Battle for Azeroth expansion where early on you'd get only get something actually new every two to three levels, which slowly spaced out until you hit the final new skill at level 80, at which point you got <em>no</em> new non talent skills until reaching the level cap forty levels later. Which, thanks to increasing exp costs per level, would take much longer than the forty levels prior as well. You'd still get about a few new talents in that time, but only in about fifteen level increments. This was a major factor in the upcoming level squish, setting the new level cap all the way back down to 60 so every level would feel meaningful again.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Digimon Masters Online</em>, one will notice that by around Digimons' level 70 up to 90, these levels don't increase the Digimon's stats anymore at all. There is only a visible slight increase in the Critical Hit Rate per level from this point on. This is easily notable in high level grinding where the Digimon's relative strength is dictated almost purely by its offensive power (making Digimon meant to be tanks almost useless due to a sizable number of factors). However, Evasion and Critical are affected by the level gap between the Digimon and its target; generally, if your target is of a lower level then criticals happen more often, where as the reverse is also true (higher level target = much less criticals). The damage dealt by a critical is also increased with higher critical rate (e.g. a 1400 base damage strike with 60% critical hit rate's critical hit is less powerful than a 1400 base damage strike with 80% critical hit rate's critical hit.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lineage2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lineage2">Lineage 2</a></em>, save for the first few levels, the stat increase from levels themselves doesn't make much of a gameplay difference (outside requiring you to fight tougher monsters), what does make a difference is getting new skills (which include significant stat increases), which comes with levels, however, not every level gets you skills. For levels 40-70 you get skills (depending on class) every 4-3 levels, and from then on every 3-2 levels. The levels inbetween are empty.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a> Battle</em>, the Chao Karate has a feature like this where the amount of damage the enemy does and how much you do to them seems to be rooted in the swim stat. To elaborate: if your chao has all (just for the sake of simplicity, B-rank skills) level 84 skills except for swim and stamina, which are level 70 and you get your ass kicked in chao karate, you'd think that leveling up your swim (doubles as the defense stat) would make you more resistant to damage, right? Wrong! While leveling up swim increases your defense to the point where every single hit doesn't do extreme damage, it also for some reason makes <em>the enemies themselves</em> more resistant to damage, faster, more likely to dodge, and even hit harder (at a certain point, increasing defense will reach an equilibrium with their attack (power) stat resulting in a minimum level of damage). However, the fact that they also grow generally tougher too after you stop reaping the benefits of higher defense means that you are actually making this stronger. Now take that chao of yours and give him a level 91 defense state and keep everything else the same. Suddenly, even though you used to be faster than the guy who beat you and he never evaded, he's dodging every other hit and beating you to the punch.
<ul><li> To cut it short: keep your swim a bit below your other stats (except for fatigue, which really doesn't ever need to go any higher than level 60) and focus on increasing your power and run stats, as these will let you hit harder and more frequently.

So, while you might take six hits to kill at the beginning, eventually, you'll go down in one or two. Since the difficulty settings also subtly tweak the platforming sections, this can be a sore point for players who still want the more challenging platforming of the higher difficulties without virtually being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder">One Hitpoint Wonder</a> in later sections.

This is even more noticeable on Ultimortal difficulty, as you can only increase your health and it maxes out after nine levels, rendering any levels afterwards useless.

You fight level 1 slugga boyz at level 1, then level 15 slugga boyz at level 15. At first glance, there is no apparent point to leveling up, as doing so merely results in smallish stat boosts with every skill point, but every 10 skill points would provide a powerful new ability that could change how each of the squads played. This, combined with new unlockable wargear options that were exponentially more powerful than the initial loadouts (thunderhammers, orbital bombardments, and Terminator armour were the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> examples), caused massive spikes in the power of the player's squads every couple missions with little noticeable gain in between.
</li><li> Early on Blue Byte's IOS and PC game <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlestationsHarbinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlestationsHarbinger">Battlestations Harbinger</a></em>, when you gain levels you get a new ship added to what you can pilot and add to your support fleet until you reach the maximum of Level 21. However the best ships in the game at the time are found around Level 12 and 13: the Armada capital ship and the Valiant heavy cruiser carrier. The ship you can choose at Level 14 is still pretty decent despite being excessively slow and having fewer main gun hardpoints, it does have a lot of fighter bays . At Level 15 the next ship is much worse, it gains a significant boost in speed (which in this game, isn't very important) but it loses a carrier slot and it has no point defense coverage on the flanks and rear. In a game where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> dominates, being a quick ship isn't all that (weapons are often hit-scan or otherwise to fast too dodge even for the quickest ship, while fighter squadrons will outpace any ship. That's why point-defense, fighter squadrons, strong shields/armour and a lot of main guns is more important). The final ship you get at Level 21, has 3 carrier slots for the most amount of fighters at the time, good armour, decent point-defense and it's very quick, but it only has a single main gun slot. Things have changed somewhat once the game was renamed <em>Battlevoid Harbinger</em>, as two new powerful ships have been added and some late game ships were improved, though there's still a lot of empty levels.

Not even a single hit point. Not much reward after the ridiculous grind (especially since the game divides XP gained by how many group members total you have, up to 8) to get to those high levels.

However, attribute increases are tied to all skills that use that attribute. The result is that if you train the wrong combination of skills or choose the wrong attributes to increase upon leveling up, you can end up with a character with a high level but weak attributes. The most efficient (but time-consuming) builds end up carefully leveling up very specific combinations of skills to get three x5 attribute multipliers (the highest possible) per level.

Enemies level scale based purely on your level, but your actual strength in combat involves many factors besides just level (health gain per level, attributes, equipment, and skills). As such, leveling up with too many non-combat skills is likely to result in an insignificant bonus to your abilities, but all enemies still increase in strength. Even if you've been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">careful in your leveling</a>, damage caps at a certain point while health does not, meaning high-level fights become increasingly drawn-out with even standard foes becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">damage sponges</a> without providing much challenge. While being a full blown min-maxing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkin</a> is only necessary if you want to max out <em>every</em> single attribute, you're best served incorporating elements of it in order to avoid falling on the wrong side of the curve.
</li><li> Alternatively, it's possible to gain a significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelAdvantage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelAdvantage">Low-Level Advantage</a> by leveling up skills but <em>never sleeping</em>. Though this severely limits your ability to make use of NPC trainers, as you can only use them five times per level, your skills will still increase naturally through use and by finding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy">skill books</a>.

In addition, you can pick one new perk per level to increase your effectiveness within a particular skill. However, empty leveling is still possible if you invest perks primarily in non-combat skills (naturally, as it logically doesn't help that you can pick any lock or sell ice to a Frost Atronach when a bandit is trying to plant his axe in your skull).

It's particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> because the new monsters it introduces would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> to even a character who reached level 50, and the cap is 30. It's even possible for a character to gain no stats at all from a level up.
<ul><li> <em>Fallout 3</em>'s system was actually implemented as a direct response to <em>Oblivion. Oblivion</em> started with a basic NPC and added levels and improved gear as the player leveled. By level 20 or so, this created a bizarre world where every random bandit wears a suit of top-shelf armor and has an artifact-level enchanted weapon. <em>Fallout</em> instead uses a list of pre-built enemies with a short list of random equipment. These enemies rotate in and then out as the player levels. For example, a level 8 character will start encountering Super Mutant Brutes in addition the garden variety Super Mutants. By level 15, there will be almost no regular Super Mutants to be found, having given over almost entirely to Brutes and tougher-still Masters (as above, this system was later used again in <em>Skyrim</em>). Similarly, standard Mirelurks are mostly replaced by Mirelurk Hunters at high levels. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> of Broken Steel start appearing among their lower-level brethren around Level 15, and can almost completely supplant them in some areas, e.g. the Super Mutant Overlords in Vault 87 and Feral Ghoul Reavers in Franklin Metro.
</li><li> Despite the devs' efforts, <em>Fallout 3</em> is still one of the most literal examples of the trope because, much like the problem with <em>Oblivion</em>'s level scaling, your attributes and skills only provide a minimal boost to effectiveness in combat outside the combat skill you are currently using (which you can max out at the very beginning of the game). Gaining levels causes enemy variants with higher health and generally better weapons to appear. Your actual combat effectiveness is based on what weapons and armor you currently have equipped, so while late-game weapons do technically require a high investment in their related skill for you to use them at most effectively (generally an investment in the skill in question to get full damage on top of a minimum Strength requirement to even hold it steady), the level scaling is not actually related to the aspect of the game that defines how good you perform in combat. This is somewhat of a moot point, however, as the effectiveness of late game weapons is so ridiculous that even mid-tier pistols would liquefy Behemoths, Overlords, and Hellfire Troopers with ease.
</li><li> This is a recurring issue among <em>Fallout 3</em>'s DLC, as well. The devs apparently expected players to have already finished the main game and play through the DLC areas and quests with their high-level endgame characters, rather than making new characters to see the new content while re-exploring the wasteland - but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance">the way they found to balance the enemies against high-level players</a> was by simply giving them flat damage resistance against the player's weapons and guaranteed damage that ignores the player's armor. This leads to ridiculous situations where, for instance, <em>Point Lookout</em>'s backwater tribals using pistol-caliber rifles or double-barrel shotguns and wearing no armor - often not even a shirt - are the equivalent of a Super Mutant Brute or Master wielding a missile launcher back in the Capital Wasteland at both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">resisting dozens of your bullets</a> and near-instantly pasting you with theirs. It's most apparent in <em>Mothership Zeta</em>, where the aliens with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a> increase their Damage Resistance even further as you level up, as well as increasing in frequency. By the level cap at 30, they can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a>, possibly creating an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">unwinnable</a> situation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> is just like <em>Fallout 3</em> in this regard, because even the lowly raiders will match you as you level up. The game has no level cap and they removed the skill system in favor of merging it with perks, so the main difference between a level 1 player and a level 50 (or 100) player is their gear and the number of perks they have. But, since perks can do everything from boosting your rifle damage and unlocking upgrades, to letting you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">teleport</a> twenty feet to hit someone with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">sledgehammer</a> from across the room or hack a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing">Sentry Bot</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism">self-destruct</a>, you can become very powerful at high levels. Every time you have to spend a perk point leveling up a stat just to unlock a perk you actually want can feel like an empty level, so it doesn't completely avert this trope.

Fusoya is a more straight example, since his stats don't change after a level up.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> has an interesting inversion in that the Onion Knight class has pretty much empty level ups until they reach <em>level 92</em>, whereupon they have almost game-breakingly powerful levels. They go from being all but useless at 90 to by far the most powerful at 99.
</li><li> If you want real ultimate power in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, put off gaining levels until you start getting a selection of Espers.

The damage algorithm <em>does</em> take levels into account, but you're still not increasing your base stats without Espers. This also means equipment selections are more important than usual.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> is undoubtedly the king of this trope; the game becomes much easier once you disable random encounters and just abuse the crap out of GF-junctioning by playing the card game for items to transmute into spells. You can also increase up to four of your stats by one point each by junctioning the proper GFs and abilities. These points are in addition to those the character would otherwise have gotten.

However, their base stats increase more when wearing gear that increases that base stat. Therefore, to get the highest stats possible, you need to keep your characters at level one until you get gear with high stat bonuses. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note04az5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note04az5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note04az5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Stats, however, are irrelevant in regards to Zidane, Freya, and Quina, since their best skills are based on reaching a total number of collectibles or kills, and the only thing the player has to worry about is MP.</span>

The game had several empty spots on its "spheregrid" leveling system, and several abilities required you to follow a sidepath and then waste time moving back to where you left off. Fortunately, you could retrace 4 previously crossed spaces for the cost of moving to a single new one, and later in the game, you got both the ability to teleport around the spheregrid and the ability to fill in the empty spaces with new bonuses. Heck, in the "post-game," you could rip out weaker stat bonuses and replace them entirely with stronger ones!

Monsters get a lot of power just from leveling up, while human characters (especially physical-based classes) only get some power from leveling up and get more power from improving their gear. Since the enemies in random battles are tied to the average level of your party (while story battles have pre-set levels for the enemies), and many random battles contain monsters. Unless you go through the pains of nicking off gears off the humans from random encounters (their equipment are appropriately upgraded for their levels), those monsters can become a real pain very quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> In the browser RPG <em>Heroes Of Ardania</em>, levels mean almost nothing to most classes except HP. If a player "plays as they should", their rise in levels and their rise in power should mostly be around the same (power will go faster for a player that really knows what they're doing). But if a player just gains empty xp without doing quests or getting good items, in certain areas the number of monsters will rise depending on level and the player won't be strong enough. Of course, that is the player's own damn fault, and level only matters in a few instances anyway.

The max level one could get was 20. However, the protagonist would not become a Jedi until a few hours in to the game; party members also joined at whatever level the protagonist currently was.

The second was attempted by having companions start at level 1, with retroactive experience given to bring them up to the same level as your current party; however, this just resulted in the same issue as for the player character from the first game, as with enough influence the player can turn most companions into Jedi, and as such a player would want to level them up as little as possible before that point lest they waste any of their companions' potential<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2shyu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2shyu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2shyu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">particularly a problem for light-side players who get Mira, as she has a difficult one-on-one fight with Hanharr then a long slog through multiple other enemies before she properly joins the party</span>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaRPG">SaGa</a></em> series has a variation: characters don't gain levels in the traditional sense, instead powering up based on the player's actions. However, these stat gains don't always scale well with how the <strong>enemies</strong> grow stronger, resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> difficulties. The worst of the lot by <em>far</em> is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnlimitedSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnlimitedSaga">Unlimited Saga</a></em>: around the middle of the game, finishing a map is likely to give you <strong>worse</strong> rewards than any of the stats you've already gained, and you can't <strong>skip</strong> an "upgrade", meaning you have to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">dump slot</a> on the Grid that drags your stats down.
</li><li> Long before <em>Oblivion</em> ever hit the scene, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIII">Ultima III</a></em> (at least the NES port) was dick-slapping players with this trope. At the beginning of the game, all the overworld enemies can be mass-exterminated with spells that cost nothing to cast. On the other hand, leveling up makes all the enemies tougher (quickly phasing out the ones that can be easily exterminated)... <em>without</em> increasing your base stats. As a result, it was best to play as much of the game as possible without gaining any levels!
</li><li> The Throne of Bhaal expansion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate2">Baldur's Gate 2</a></em> raises the XP cap all the way to 8 million (allowing for level caps somewhere around level 40 for non-multi or dual classed characters.) There's not much point in leveling up that far, though, as by around level 30 all leveling up does is give you a little more HP and an extra high-level ability to choose from (and if you're a mage, you'll have probably already gotten all the possible high-level spells and extra spell slots you can possibly get before then, and thus won't even get that option.)
<ul><li> The big winners are dual- and multi-class characters as the cap is applied to all experience ever earned by the character over his or her lifetime, not to the experience for each individual class. This means that a high-level fighter who dual classes to mage will have a reasonable opportunity to have their mage level exceed their fighter levels (allowing them to use their fighter abilities again). This may have been the purpose of the high cap.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Soulblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Soulblazer">Soulblazer</a></em>, leveling up increases your HP, Attack, Defence, and Luck scores. Attack, Defence, and Luck max out at level 24, by which point you'll probably be at or near the end of the game. All you get from this point on is 2HP per level. To make things worse, experience requirements increase almost exponentially, so leveling quickly becomes a torturous grind. You might get two or three levels for some extra HP against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, but anythings else is just for bragging rights. If, however, you continue to spend hours grinding, at level 47, you max out your health at 100HP, and the final 3 levels you can gain give you <em>absolutely nothing</em>; they just bring your level count to a nice round 50. And Level 47 is reached at 59 million EXP, points, while you won't hit level 50 until 100 million. Those three useless levels take a full 2/5 of your EXP. For comparison, level 24 only needs 420 <em>thousand</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em> levels tend to not give you too much along the line of stats, especially late game.

Levels are practically pointless because majority of the improvements come from equipment and their attached skills, as well as fusing equipment to higher levels. Even HP isn't helped by levels, as acquiring Anomalous Orbs automatically increase the whole party's maximum HP by default. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">And the game doesn't do a well enough job on explaining the equipment, its skills, and stacking</a>.

This is, however, both justified in that Kyuu is not a natural fighter and thus wouldn't gain as much from combat as the others and exploited in that it encourages the player to get Kyuu to go and train with others in order to gain the moves he needs to survive.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> was a direct translation of D&amp;D 3.0 and has most of the same problems you'll see under the Tabletop Games section, but it adds several new ones too by removing some abilities that are hard to translate and rendering others pointless through design elements. There are a few elements that are noted by most players as being bad even if they're not completely empty:
<ul><li> Weapon Master gets all its class abilities by level 7, making levels 8, 9, and 10 empty levels. If you take this up to epic levels this includes levels 11 and 12 too, which makes it the longest unbroken chain of completely empty levels in the game.
</li><li> Shadowdancer is a downplayed example, as they get their best class feature at the very first class level. They continue to gain minor tricks and abilities past that, but most of them are either obtained through equipment the player likely already has, obtainable through other classes a Shadowdancer likely already takes, or just plain useless, which makes them feel empty even if they're not.
</li><li> In a more general sense the game was not designed for epic level progression, with a significant number of epic levels being empty and most of the power increases coming from feats. Further, because epic-level progression gives exactly the same stat increases (except HP) regardless of what class you take it is easy to gain an epic level and receive absolutely nothing. While this is true to the tabletop game, the tabletop game has other systems in place to make sure a player can keep gaining abilities even if they're not directly tied to level, something the video game can't do.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResonanceOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResonanceOfFate">Resonance of Fate</a></em> is a curious case, with the emptiest levels being the first ones. Levelling a character increases their HP, weapon proficiency, and most importantly their weight limit. Almost all a charatcer's power comes from the weapon and attachments that use up that limit, but for the first few chapters, it's hard to find enough attachments to fill that limit. Combined with how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> damage is handled, crossing that 1000HP mark is a <em>detriment</em> to your survival with no power increase to show for it. Beyond a certain point, gun customization opens right up and every new level is a tangible chance to squeeze more performance from your characters again.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em> has a bonus experience system to mitigate this; at the end of each chapter you are given "bonus experience" that you can then expend on units in between maps, and if a unit levels up from bonus experience, their level up will always raise exactly three stats (or whatever is left that isn't capped if there's less than three stats to raise). Besides ensuring more stable growth, it can be exploited to raise a unit's weaker stats once they cap stats they have higher growths in, especially useful for a unit that tends to cap some stats fast while having a lackluster growth in a vital stat. With normal level ups, Radiant Dawn also always forces at least one stat to raise up during leveling, to prevent instances of a unit leveling up with no stat growths at all.

Unlike most Fire Emblem games, Three Houses takes place in a school, and characters can learn weapon/riding/armor skills (which are now also needed to unlock more powerful classes) through lessons. To prevent characters from leveling up too fast, the game has added intermediate skill ranks, i.e; you go from C to C+ instead of B, which don't unlock new weapons, and usually don't contribute to unlocking abilities or classes. There are also full ranks that don't give any effects, e.g; a C in heavy armor won't unlock a new class, and the game sometimes requires you to learn skills that you don't need just to unlock a better class, e.g; you can't unlock the best Axe class without being good at punching, even though they are not the same skillset.

These usually have a small gap (usually 1 or 2, and rarely 3) for the first effect, and large gaps (sometimes reaching 12 or more) for the second ability. Everything else in-between does nothing but chew up your mana for the turn, and since these creatures are very rarely immune to creature removal and it's blatantly obvious to your opponent when you'll get the final level-up that matters, they can save their removal until you've wasted as much mana as possible.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Role-Playing Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a>. While early-edition clerics and magic users could gain new spells with every few levels, fighters were mainly stuck with the standard increase in attack bonus, saving throws and hit points that everyone got upon leveling up. Also literally an empty level is Rogue 20 (the Level Cap) in edition 3.5- unlike almost every other level or <em>class</em> in the game, you get actually nothing for it. The standard bonuses to health, accuracy, and defenses are given to all classes, so Rogue 19/Anything 1 is better than Rogue 20
<dl><dd><ul><li> Even worse was Fighter 5, the absolute most pointless level in the game, which only increases attack bonus, hit points, and the minimum possible number of skill points, with no class features and no increase in saving throws. The only reason to take it is to get to Fighter level 6, and a serious optimizer only has about three reasons to do that (two specific 20-level builds or a particular alternative class feature at level 6). On the other hand, serious optimizers seldom recommend taking Fighter past level 2... or at all.
</li><li> The fighter situation was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0064.html">referenced<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em>:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Thog</strong>: thog only multiclass to fighter for two levels to get bonus feats. fighter level 3 is dumb level. thog not take.
</div><ul><li> Sorcerer Level 2 was an arguable example. Other than the standard increase (and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>, it was barely noticeable), your gain in spells known consisted of one new zero-level spell. Paladin gets Lay on Hands and Divine Grace, wizard gets two new first-level spells like Mage Armor or Protection form Evil, sorcerer can make a small light now. There's a reason that delayed casting was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Scrappy Mechanic</a> for sorcerer players.
</li><li> Probably the funniest example of this was the Pale Master prestige class. As a whole, it's a rather quirky and powerful necromancy class themed around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchOfDeath">Touch of Death</a> that turns the victims into zombies, but for some reason, its <em>first</em> level is an empty level. Hell, the class even advances your arcane spellcasting for every level... except for that first level.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> There are two <em>Character Class</em> column <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150620232128/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cwc/20061013a">articles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150620211207/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cwc/20070227x">online<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> called "Dead Levels" that try to fix dead levels of core classes with "minor special abilities" that you can add if there's no existing class feature present.
</li><li> This trope is rarer in 5th edition, but still present. For example, while most clerics get a d8 added to their Divine Strike damage at level 14, the Arcana, Light, and Knowledge domains get only the ability to instantly kill two very specific low-level undead with their Turn Undead ability and nothing else. Meanwhile, for paladins, <em>1st level</em> is empty, as paladins only get Lay on Hands (allowing them to heal up to 5 HP worth of damage or cure a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusAilment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusAilment">Standard Status Ailment</a>) and the so-useless-it's-practically-cosmetic Divine Sense, which just lets you detect if there are any fiends, celestials, or undead within 60 feet of you that don't have total cover a few times per day. Most paladins will probably go all the way to level 20 without ever using it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a> took a look at 3rd Edition and carefully designed the revised base classes so that all of them get something new (either a class feature or a new range of spells) at each level. The aforementioned fighter is a good example. It used to be that every odd level (except for first) was a dead level but the added armor training and weapon training abilities gave fighters a small bump in power. It was also made less boring by various archetypes (specialized sub-classes) that give it more flavor, such as gladiator, crossbowman, roughrider, corsair, etc.
<ul><li> Sadly, the proliferation of extra abilities didn't necessarily make the classes significantly more powerful - just load them with more description text and things to keep track of. It should be noted that an online supplement for 3.5 already suggested minor abilities be added in any "dead level" of a class, but restricted dead level abilities to very weak ones that would not affect game balance. Pathfinder was less timid, adding abilities that were more useful and powerful, but despite claims made by the designers, if anything, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a> gap actually grew rather than shrank in Pathfinder, since almost every class received boosts, while many melee-oriented feats were nerfed or split.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 4th Edition has a standard level progression for all classes, PC and monster attacks and defenses scaling pretty evenly. However, since characters generally need to spend a few feat slots to keep up with the 'expected' progression, leading to the much maligned 'feat tax' abilities, levels where you don't gain a new combat power feel like empty levels for every class. The effect gets worse at high level, because while paragon paths add new and (usually) awesome powers, most epic destinies aren't all that noticeable in gameplay until the final level.
</li><li> For most classes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em>, Nearly <em>all</em> levels after the first are effectively empty, except for certain abilities that may gain potency or additional uses at set levels. This is due to most classes gaining most or all of their features right off the bat.
</li></ul></div>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl">Blood Bowl</a></em>, some players start with very good stats and only get better the more levels and skills they get. Others start out with pretty much everything they need to fulfill their role, and gaining too many levels can actually be detrimental to you because it increases your team's team value without increasing its effectiveness. Practically every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">lineman</a> or player with 'stunty' falls into this category; a level or two can be handy for some specialisation, but beyond that the cost increases aren't worth it.
