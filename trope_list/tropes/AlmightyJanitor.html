</p><p>Then there's the Almighty Janitor.
</p><p>The Almighty Janitor is that character who is near the bottom of the scale in terms of rank, but is at the top in terms of what he can actually accomplish. Maybe he screwed up in the past, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ">maybe he pissed off the higher-ups and has been paying for it ever since</a>, maybe he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dismotivation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dismotivation">really lazy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JanitorImpersonationInfiltration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JanitorImpersonationInfiltration">undercover</a>, or maybe he just likes his job (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob">perhaps more than clinically recommended</a>). Often, his lowly position is the very thing that grants him access to the true levels of power (for one thing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathNotice">nobody pays much attention to him</a>, so nobody interferes with him). Typically, he'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">never go up in rank at all</a>.

<ul><li> This is the very basis of Vegeta's rivalry with Goku.

While Vegeta is still very powerful and usually second only to Goku in strength, the catch here is that Goku is a third-class Saiyan warrior while Vegeta is the prince of all Saiyans.

<ul><li> The eponymous character remains a genin (the lowest possible active duty rank) right up to the very end of the main plot, partly because after his first attempt at the Chunin Exam is interrupted midway through, he's away from the village on a training journey while his peers pass it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Only in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> do we get to see him at a higher rank, namely as the Seventh Hokage (the leader of all of Konoha).</span> However, he is prone to ignoring any rules or orders that he doesn't like, and gets away with it by virtue of personal connections with the brass and being one of the strongest ninjas in the entire world.
</li><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> episode features an old man nicknamed "The Ten-Thousand Year Genin", who has been a genin for half a century despite being as skilled as a jonin (the highest active duty rank) because his guilt over causing the death of his comrades has led him to refuse promotion.
</li><li> Considering that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueAgent">Nukenins</a> have no ranks anymore, some of them were never promoted to jonins. Sasuke was never promoted to a chunin, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Obito Uchiha alias Tobi was never promoted to a jonin.</span>
</li><li> There's Might Guy's father, who was mocked for being the "Forever Genin". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He was the <em>first person</em> who mastered the Eight Gates and proceeded to use them to protect his son and his comrades by fighting <em>all Seven Swordsmen of the Mist by himself</em>.

By the time he's fired from Spirit Detective, Yusuke was as powerful as an S-class youkai, and at his disappearance his predecessor Sensui was estimated to be A-class.
<ul><li> There's also Chu, the alternate of Team Rokuyoukai who turns out to be the team captain and strongest member. How'd he end up as the alternate? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">He's really bad at rock-paper-scissors</a>.

<ul><li> It later develops into this for the three boys regarding their role as Demon Slayers, and Nezuko as well within the demon power scale. Early in the series the boy trio are as strong as their ranks suggest, they need to take Lower Ranks within the Twelve Kizuki very seriously and an Upper Rank is well beyond their capabilities; a few training sessions and grueling battles after, the boys are just small steps behind the Hashira in terms of power despite their placement never reaching the top among the 10 field ranks for Slayers, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by the Infinity Castle arc, Giyu outright states Tanjiro has reached Hashira level in terms of strength</span>. In Nezuko's case her raging bloodlust born out of desperation against Daki has the latter outright commenting on Nezukos power resembling that of an Upper Rank demon, despite the fact Nezuko being a nobody as far as the hierarchy is concerned. By the end of the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke would've all qualified for promotion to Hashira rank (by killing a Kizuki, or in Tanjiro's case Muzan himself), had the Demon Slayer corps not been disbanded due to the deaths of Muzan and all the Kizuki having more or less ended the demon threat</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>:
<ul><li> Clare is ranked dead last among Claymores at #47, and is treated like a piece of garbage as as result of being seen as weak. However, she ends up being one of the most powerful Claymores through pure gumption and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> and becomes capable of taking on — and <em>winning</em> — against Claymores ranked in the top 5. Part of her success comes from the fact that she has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Power Copying</a> higher-ranked warriors like no tomorrow since about chapter 20.
</li><li> It's implied that part of the reason that she was ranked so low is due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>; she single-mindedly trained herself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuraVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuraVision">read yoma energy</a>, which is a perfect tactic to use against the massively powerful Awakened Beings who exude huge amounts of power, but <em>far</em> less useful against regular, weak yoma, which were all she was ever sent to fight until a few volumes into the manga.
</li><li> Also a remind that she wasn't created with half yoma, but rather requested to be infused with Teresa's blood (manga shows her holding Teresa's head and requests the organization to accept her).
</li><li> Also a downplayed example would be Rafaela. She ranks #5 despite being the equal of her sister who was #1. This is because she was a retired former #2 and the organisation called her back to use her for special secret missions.

</li><li> Tony-Tony Chopper is the Straw Hat Crew's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">doctor</a>, but has the ridiculously low bounty of 100 berries (and even that's a relatively recent development; it used to be 50) while his teammates are all in the tens- or hundreds-of-millions. This is because he has been mistaken by the Marines as the Straw Hat Crew's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">mascot</a>. In truth, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">monstrously powerful</a> and a vital member of the team.
</li><li> Sanji's constantly doing more covert work for the crew, and is one of the top 3 fighters, but lacked even a bounty until the Enies Lobby Arc. His 177 million bounty after the Dressrosa arc isn't even the third highest. It's the fourth, right behind Usopp's bounty of 200 million, despite being near equal strength to that of Zoro and Luffy, both of whom have bounties that are in the <em>hundreds</em> of millions.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06be9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06be9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06be9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Given that bounties are based on the overall threat a pirate presents to the World Government, with strength in a fight being only one factor in judging that threat, if the Government knew of Sanji's skill as an infiltrator and saboteur it's very possible that he'd end up with a higher bounty than Zoro.</span> Then you add in that horrible sketch they put as his first bounty picture, which makes him near unrecognizable, and that's when you figure out why fans call "Black Leg" Sanji <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a> of <em>One Piece</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However as of the end of the Totto Land arc Sanji's bounty has shot up to 330 million, making his bounty the second highest in the entire crew, behind only Luffy's.</span>
<ul><li> There's also Sanji's position in the crew. Concerning the members of the Monster Trio: Luffy is the Captain of the crew, Zoro is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a> and the closest thing Luffy has to a First Mate, while Sanji is the cook.
</li></ul></li><li> At the start of the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Blackbeard</a> was one of these, serving little more then a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a> with no bounty under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Whitebeard</a> for decades. A while before the story starts, he is nominated to take over a vacancy as commander of the 2nd Division, but passes it up, saying he has no such ambition, and the position is given to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Ace</a>. Considering that the top four Division commanders of Whitebeard are his strongest fighters, and Blackbeard had no Devil Fruit powers at the time, this says something about him. It turns out that all he wanted was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">Yami-Yami Fruit</a>, killing Thatch of the Fourth Division for it, then fleeing, making his own crew, capturing Ace, cashing in, becoming one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Seven Warlords of the Sea</a>, and revealing that he has a lot of ambition, and this is just the start of them.
</li><li> The Marines mistake <em>Buggy the Clown</em> for this and believe he kept a low bounty as a way of not drawing attention, the reason being his association with Shanks, one of the Four Emperors and his past history as part of Gold Roger's Crew. Numerous powerful pirates that joined in Luffy and Buggy's jailbreak from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">Impel Down</a> also believed this was the case, and joined his crew without realizing that they're all much stronger than he is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is now one of the Warlords and more of an inversion of the trope.</span>
</li><li> Foxy the Silver Fox has a bounty of 26 million Berries, yet came closer to killing the protagonist than several villains in the series thus far. Foxy's bounty (a measure of power between pirates) is by far the lowest of any main villain in the Grand Line, the next lowest one being over twice as much. While Foxy is of below-average strength and a bit of a coward, he's got a rather useful Devil Fruit and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">and is quite good at using it</a>, not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">having no interest in fighting fair</a>.
</li><li> A few Marines count as lesser examples, as some are ranked fairly high, but not quite far enough to suit their abilities:
<ul><li> Vice Admiral Garp is very high up in the Marines, though one would wonder why the guy known for being on par with <em>the Pirate King</em> and is referred to as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">"The Hero"</a> hasn't reached the top by the time the series began. As it turns out, he had actually been offered a position as Admiral numerous times, but refused them all. Vice Admiral is the highest rank that would still allow him to largely do his own thing.
</li><li> Captain Smoker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> tendencies are implied to be the reason he had the rank he did at the start of the series, considering he's a massively skilled combatant with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Logia powers</a> (notably, the only other Logia users shown in the Marines are <em>Admirals</em>, though in fairness his Logia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSmoke">powers</a> lack the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a> qualities most do). This is even pointed in the Enies Lobby arc, when several Marine Captains are sent after the exhausted Straw Hats; despite it being pointed out that they share the same rank as Smoker, they are a lot easier to take down. However, averting one of the conventions of this trope listed above, Smoker actually has been gaining promotions as the story progresses, first to Commodore after his second major appearance (which still wasn't accurate, concerning his strength level), and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becoming a Vice Admiral after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> (which <em>is</em> accurate)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Of the Shichibukai, both Boa Hancock and Crocodile had (or in Crocodile's case, have) considerably smaller bounties than their fellow Shichibukai (80 and 81 million respectively). Then again, these bounties are (or were) inactive and by no means fully reflective of their capabilities, as Crocodile warranted imprisonment in Level Six of Impel Down while Luffy only warranted Level Five (despite having a significantly higher bounty), Hancock is considered monstrously strong by <em>Sengoku</em>, and it is shown that both were capable of combating some of the strongest pirates and marines in the New World during the Paramount War. This is, of course, barring Blackbeard (who had no bounty), and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Buggy</span>, who is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a>.
<ul><li> This could be because as far as <em>One Piece</em> is concerned, bounty isn't reflective of capability, it's reflective of infamy.
</li><li> Also worth noting that Hancock's bounty was frozen at 80 million after she was offered a Shichibukai appointment after her <em>first raiding campaign</em> at the age of <em>eighteen.</em> Eighty million becomes more impressive when you know it was her starting bounty.

He even possesses the ultimate sword release, bankai, which very few non-captains possess. If he revealed it, he believes he would be pressured into developing to be a captain but all he wants is to remain Kenpachi's subordinate until the day he dies. His actual performance isn't nearly at the level of a captain but, despite the jump between third seat and lieutenant being drastic, he easily performs at the level of the most elite lieutenants.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">Yumichika</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Ayasegawa</a> is a lieutenant-class fifth seat.

The reason he doesn't use his abilities is because his squad is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">anti-kidou</a> and that's where his talent lies.
</li><li> Given that Soul Society puts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> on Captains and Lieutenants when they enter the world of the living (so that their spiritual power won't endanger the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a>; in severe emergencies the limiters are removed), and Ikkaku and Yumichika are stronger than most Lieutenants yet don't have the limiters...one has to wonder how much damage the two of them inadvertently do.
</li><li> Rukia Kuchiki spent most of the story as an officer class Shinigami who was ranked among the common foot soldiers due to her brother having prevented her obtaining to a seated officer's position to protect her, as higher-ranked Shinigami are assigned to far more dangerous missions. When he apparently stops holding her career back, she takes the vacant lieutenant's position in her squad. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of the series, Rukia becomes a Captain some time after Ukitake dies, having achieved Bankai near the end of the story</span>.

Despite having a Bankai and power that rivals most Captains, he's officially not affiliated with the Gotei 13 at all, being granted title of "Substitute Soul Reaper", which is implied to hold no real authority given he's laughed off by an unranked officer of the Gotei 13 when he brandishes his badge.
</li></ul></li><li> Judai Yuki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> willingly remains in the low-class Osiris Red dorms despite the fact that he's the best duelist in Duel Academia. He just likes being in Red, though he has been offered a promotion.
<ul><li> Manjoume, originally in the Obelisk Blue dorms, stays in Osiris Red since the second half of the first season as a consequence of having briefly dropped out of and reentered the school.
</li><li> Rei goes to the Osiris Red dorms instead to Obelisk Blue because she has a crush on Judai.
</li><li> Actually, every important character who is in the Ra Yellow dorms is better than most of the Obelisk Blue students. However, Misawa was offered a promotion like Judai, but refused; and Sho <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">keeps getting promotions</a> and ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">became a Obelisk Blue student himself</a> (though, in the middle of the second season he defeated several Obelisk Blue students as a Ra Yellow student, later he became a Obelisk Blue student and then decided to become a Ra Yellow student again before he ultimately decided to become a Obelisk Blue student again).
</li><li> It's revealed at one point that to be an Obelisk Blue student without promoting requires attendance to a special prep school (or being female). Consequently, it's possible for a student to absolutely ace the entry exams while being an exceptional player and still start in Ra (see: Daichi and Kenzan).
</li><li> Daikotuji is the head of the Osiris Red dorm, which you'd think would make him a low man on the totem pole... but he's actually more powerful than both Asuka and Manjoume, two of the school's most skilled students.

</li><li> All the protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> are of this kind: Maka and Soul Eater began the series about to complete their training. However, when they failed their final test they were forced to go back to the beginning in order to improve. Black☆Star is a bottom-ranked student because he spends all his schoolwork time on training instead, but his innate assassin abilities and soul wavelength (and his constant drive for self-improvement) makes him more powerful than Maka. Finally, Death the Kid became a Shibusen student even though he doesn't need to (it was an attempt to bail the other main characters out of a pinch); being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">shinigami</a> he's already as powerful as a full-fledged meister.
<ul><li> The manga eventually sees some of them break out of this rut, to the point that they're not only of a rank that reflects their abilities — two-star meisters and Weapons — but members of a 'young elite' team, Spartoi. Kid is the only one of the main groups who lacks this promotion, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">unforeseen circumstances</a>.

<ul><li> Though this is true in some extent, this doesn't expel the fact that throughout all his adventures, he has raised powerful and loyal monsters that he can summon at his beck and call at any time. This is probably one of the reasons why the writers made Pikachu the only Pokémon to stay on Ash's team on a permanent basis. Pikachu would be powerful himself, but his competence <em>and</em> power level is often inconsistent by itself, and that he refuses to "evolve" into a Raichu at all.

What makes this significant is that Rank 3 is only possible for a Ghoul Investigator if they were <em>personally appointed</em> by Chairman Washuu himself. Though they might not have the formal Academic training of their peers, in general they are combat prodigies capable of demolishing high-ranked Ghouls typically only handled by veterans.

In a school where most people's counts are in the ten thousand range, Kazuki's treated like the lowest of the low for his pathetic count of eight.

However, this really amounts to a problem with the school's measuring techniques, which have no way to measure actual combat ability and only measure people based on how much magical power they can summon. While the amount of power he can call forth is incredibly limited, he's combatively one of the best fighters at his school, skilful enough to best a girl who's an order of magnitude above all the other students.

Nevertheless, he is usually put in charge in times of crisis, and frequently gets his way when the Justice Department needs to make a decision. This is partially because most of the upper echelons are his old comrades and proteges, and partially because the leadership is well aware that his reputation is a huge morale booster, and plays a large part in keeping Mega City One's absurdly high crime rate to barely manageable levels, so they avoid doing anything that would piss him off enough to quit. In fact, when he once did quit, they tried to replace him with Judge Kraken, a clone from the same genetic stock as him, who quickly became possessed by dark powers and almost destroyed the city.

The idea that such a cheap piece of machinery is able to foil a genius like him time and again is outrageous to him.

Since he needs to help with the rent and groceries, they find him a job as an elementary-school janitor. The children soon work out he's magic. He animates action figures and things. Loki's always having to point out to the myth-savvy that he's not actually a god, and so Nick Fury has referred to him as the Custodian of Mischief.
<ul><li> There is also a lovely sequence with a boy who's worried because the other janitor is going to poison an anthill and that's sad. Loki magically convinces the ants to leave on their own. Loki sets up the mother-rhinoceros protection charm on the school grounds.
</li><li> In the sequel the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier comes to call him out for a meeting while he's at work, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> tasers him in the back when he disclaims responsibility for what's happened to Captain America and tries to go back to work. The kids are <em>pissed</em>.
</li><li> The two children who are used in every schoolchild-related scene in the fic are two little boys named Patrick and Trevor, who are particular scamps and particularly attached to Mr. Loki, and serve as a stand-in for the whole species of 'small child.'
</li><li> By the end of the third segment of the series, Loki encounters a field trip from said school, in a zoo, during a pitched battle with alien invaders and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">pseudo-Nazis</a>, while dressed in the... very villainous-looking hero costume Tony made him for the occasion, and saves the group via actual rhinoceroses before running off to defeat some evil airships. When he comes back to sort them out afterward, the headmistress promises him his job back. (He'd lost it due to being kidnapped by SHIELD eight weeks previously and thus not turning up for work.) This means that as the fourth fic starts, an action figure of him as the Avengers' 'magical consultant' is about to start being produced, and he's working as a school custodian in a building where everyone is fully aware that he's a powerful alien wizard. This removes some of the incognito factor of the trope, but must make the experience of having a clean school one of which the occupants are unusually aware.

Which he still held because he had refused all previous attempts to promote him, preferring to stay in an X-Wing cockpit and dreading the thought of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldiersAtTheRear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldiersAtTheRear">a desk job</a>. And the only reason he finally accepts the promotion, to <em>general</em>, is because another officer points out that his subordinates were following suit to stay under him. And because he was about to go on a mission where he'd need rank to pull. Within about a year, he goes from a mere X-Wing pilot to the commanding officer of the Super Star Destroyer <em>Lusankya</em>. There's a meta / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> reason here.

<ul><li> One of Wedge's proteges, Garik "Face" Loran, remains a mere captain for <em>20+ years</em> as the head of Intelligence's Wraith division, up until he's forced into retirement by office politics. (He goes on to perform one quasi-authorized mission and is promptly reinstated — as the head of Intelligence.) In his case, this is very deliberate on both his part and his boss's; the rank of captain is just high enough to be autonomous and have sufficient pull for his needs (and if he needs to pull more rank, he has a direct line to the minister), while being low enough that nobody would expect to have heard of him or his whereabouts, allowing him to disappear as needed for his job.

He can't sack her as she's the only one who can get his brew exactly right, <em>and</em> provide the Danish pastry he so loves. Besides, this makes him look like a humourless Hitler who cannot take a joke. So she gets away with it. She gets to see the whole building and everyone in it. If she times it right, she can trade hot gossip almost the minute it happens. She is the invisible presence who pours the tea at the board meeting where promotions, pay rises and sackings are discussed. And listens.

Lieutenant Robert Geary in <em>Vanguard</em> becomes the commander of Glenlyon's only warship <em>Squall</em> but doesn't get a bump in rank. Moreover, the rank is specifically stated to be provisionary. To be fair, though, the ship is only a cutter, with a crew of two dozen. Despite this, Geary knows that everything he's doing now is eventually going to shape the tradition of the future Glenlyon fleet, so he does his best to set a good example, such as never questioning the orders of the civilian government (at least, in front of his crew) and refusing to bend those orders even a little. On the ground, Sergeant Mele Darcy is a former marine from another colony. When she gets asked to form Glenlyon's first ground/marine forces, she is also told that her rank of sergeant is provisionary. Unlike Geary, though, her rank is very quickly bumped to major (not sergeant major), even before her first operation, although she only has a few dozen soldiers under her command.

</li><li> Halfway through Voyager, Harry Kim realizes that he's effectively <em>become</em> this Trope. He's been on so many adventures and saved the ship so many times, but the fact that Voyager is thousands of lightyears away from Earth means he can't be officially promoted and is stuck at the rank of Ensign until they get home, even though by Season 4 he's become <em>vastly</em> overqualified. He does take steps to combat the trope though, taking on larger responsibilities, challenging authority when needed, and getting past his initial naivety, but because of Voyager's position he remains the lowest-ranked member of the crew (aside from Neelix and Seven, but only because they aren't "officially" members of Starfleet).

Arthur's made it so clear by now that Merlin's opinion is the one he values over all others — but still forgets to pay his wages half the time, let alone make him an official adviser. Be honest, Arthur just likes throwing things at Merlin and wouldn't get to do that if Merlin had rank. Merlin also takes advantage of this trope by hanging out all over the place when he needs to gather information, since no one will question the Prince's manservant "cleaning the bedrooms" or hanging out around the throne room.
<ul><li> The trope is also deconstructed-even though everyone in the know values Merlin's opinion, his position as a servant means that Uther and many other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> knights treat him like dirt.

He mentions that people "never thought he'd make it past captain", and his job's been in trouble many times due to him having messed with the guy upstairs.

You can also say the entirety of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">team</a> is like this.
<ul><li> A good example of just how much of an Almighty Janitor he is can be seen in the two parter, "The Storm" and "The Eye" in Series One, where he manages to hold off an occupying force of Genii soldiers in Atlantis <em>single-handed</em> by outsmarting them at every turn. All the while, while managing to disable key systems so they can't follow him and still find time to accomplish his other objective, rerouting the lightning rod grounding stations to power the City's shield to protect it from an incoming hurricane that covers roughly 20% of the planet's surface.

He ends up becoming the most powerful Time Lord to ever exist, earning the title of Lord President of Gallifrey (thrice!) and President of Earth, as well as the greatest hero in the Universe, but still prefers to just wander from place to place.
</li><li> Donna Noble, best temp in Chiswick, discovers key information in several episodes by putting her paper-filing and administration powers to good use. In "The Sontaran Strategem", for example, she finds an empty sick-leaves folder that leads them to question the episode's suspicious company.

One episode showed him devising a massive (and successful) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed Chess</a> plan to get the pub, which was currently in the middle of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">chickens-steakhouse-and-airline-miles scheme</a>, a perfect score from the health inspector, while the other workers cared more about who would get credit for the scheme than about the possibility of the bar being shut down.
<ul><li> On the other hand, this was subverted in the episode "The Gang Reignites the Rivalry", where Charlie decides that he'll ingratiate himself with the students by copying the events of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodWillHunting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodWillHunting">Good Will Hunting</a></em>. He thinks he'll say something that reveals him to actually be an intelligent and well-learned genius despite the initial impression of him being a simple janitor, which will wow them and make them love him. Unfortunately for Charlie, it turns out he's not just a simple janitor—he's a flat-out moron with almost no education to speak of. When he tries to act smart around the college students, his incoherent rambling totally fails to impress them.

However, the Grounders and the remaining members of the 100 listen to her above anyone else, letting Clarke largely control the camp's relations with the Grounders and their war against Mount Weather. When Abby, the camp's official leader, tries overruling her, Clarke tells her, "You may be the Chancellor, but I'm in charge."

Naturally, even after being out of the loop for so long, when pushed into a fight by a group of asshole bullies he utterly dominates all four of them in a fight and kicks the crap out of all of them with very little effort.

<ul><li> Hestia for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> is quite literally an Almighty Janitor. Zeus's eldest sister, the eldest of the Olympian gods, and one of the six strongest beings in the cosmos, while all her siblings become kings or queens of various realms/aspects of reality, she just keeps busy as a house-keeper. Yes, on Mount Olympus the wizened old guy on the center throne with the bad ass lightning bolt and laundry-list of slain monsters is both the younger brother of, and about as strong as, the soft-spoken lady who brings him his food and sweeps-up. Two examples of how badass she is:
<ul><li> She is, canonically, one of only three beings in the Cosmos over whom Aphrodite has no power, the others being the other two virgin goddesses, Artemis and Athena. For reference, Aphrodite is capable of beguiling Zeus himself — or granting Hera the power to — but she's powerless over Hestia.
</li><li> Despite being one of the deities about whom the fewest myths are told, she was worshiped in practically every household and at the heart of every city. Bringing some of Hestia's flame was crucial to founding any new colony. And the Homeric hymns tell us that she receives a wine offering at the beginning and end of EVERY mortal feast.
</li><li> Her Roman counterpart, Vesta, was also the centre of one of the most politically powerful priesthoods in Rome, the Vestal virgins.
</li></ul></li><li> Jesus probably qualifies. Born to a humble family and raised as a carpenter, never went to school nor travelled far from his home and never invented anything; nevertheless if you believe the Bible, Jesus is also quite literally God Himself in human form.

Along came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore">Armored Core</a> 2</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore">Armored Core</a> 3</em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore">Armored Core</a> 3</em> and the sequel <em>Silent Line,</em> the arena also features a post-story unlockable enemies. The catch is that the lower in the rank they go, <em>the tougher they are</em>, so much so that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore">Armored Core</a> 3,</em> there's an email challenging you to defeat the bottom-most opponent, Exile, while giving you the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> OP-I (albeit you need to train it properly first) just to give you a slight, repeat, <em>slight</em> edge over the opponent.

The only control he took during his time as owner was to request the Sergeant rank; the previous owner made herself an Admiral. Although he usually doesn't, he can still ignore orders at will, and often just shows up at officer meetings. In his case, though, he's deliberately kept that way by the higher ranking people, who are all very well aware that giving Schlock any kind of actual power would be a horrible, horrible mistake.

Though he lost, so to speak, he had some badass skills for a janitor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> pays tribute to this concept.

<ul><li> In another episode when Timmy wishes everyone in the world was super but then later was forced to wish that there were no superheroes, turning everyone normal except the supervillains, the only way to defeat the supervillains is for all the kids and other "normal" people, including a janitor, to team up and use their "normal people powers" to defeat them.
</li><li> Denzel Crocker actually plays this trope straight, even outside of the episode in question; in spite of being portrayed as an incompetent elementary school teacher, you still have to take into account that he's done everything from creating a functional portal to Fairy World, discovering cold fusion (before someone hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> on the universe), and creating a functional rocket with embezzled school funds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">Oh, and he's always right about Timmy's fairy godparents.</a>

And because of this, Mr. Crocker is once again the same muscular janitor mentioned above in the retro-futuristic Dimsdale, where his obsession over Fairies has likewise with lots of things in retro-futuristic Dimsdale, been replaced with a hatred and fear of robots. For example, instead of shouting his usual "FAIRY GOD-PARENTS!", he now shouts "ROBOTS ARE EVIL!".

We never actually got to see him in action before the series ended, but the indications up to that point are that he really is or was as much of a legend as that indicates. His day job? Janitor at a NASA facility.
</li><li> Sizz-Lorr is likely one of the biggest and most powerful of the Irken race, yet he runs a restaraunt on the Irken snacking planet of Foodcourtia. His job title? Frylord. He's the highest-ranking Fry Cook in the Irken military.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MovilleMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MovilleMysteries">Moville Mysteries</a></em> features a school janitor who is a former archeologist and adventurer.

One episode had the kids discover that he was a math genius, whereupon he got scouted by the university, the military and by NASA— only to point out that if being a genius were his job, that would take all the fun out of it, so he'd rather be a janitor.

</li><li> Also Prowl, another member of Prime's crew, who happens to be one of the most badass Ninjas on Cybertron. His reasons for being held back were a combination of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">early life pacifism, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> after his master died.</span>

</li><li> In many American schools, the janitors really <em>do</em> get paid more than the teachers. If you ever saw the sorts of messes that a janitor had to clean up in some schools, you'd understand why. In addition, it is worth remembering that many buildings (schools or otherwise) are heated by large, complex boilers that need special licensing to operate (and failure to properly service said boiler will result in a pile of rubble where the school used to be). There are a lot fewer licensed boiler operators than licensed teachers. This means that if the janitor is <em>also</em> a licensed boiler operator, odds are very good they are the best paid person in the building. This is why "janitors" are actually "custodians", as in they take care of the building, and also clean up that mess little Billy made after a second helping of tuna pea casserole. Given the pay, benefits, and no real need for advancement, the janitor is also likely to be one of the employees who have been there the longest. They know everything.
<ul><li> At a certain high school in Texas, the head janitor is Louie Ortega, bass player of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Tornados">Texas Tornadoes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose records have gone gold, and who holds a Grammy. Also, he can solve any problem, and open any door.
</li><li> School cleaners deal with a lot of heavy lifting, have to move at speeds to accomplish more than the average person would in the time limit, and know their way around the whole school in ways not even some teachers do. They tend to therefore be physically fit and think on their feet, something that many office-working higher-ups do not have.
</li></ul></li><li> Everyone knows that the secretaries have all the power in both corporations and government bureaucracies. Anger them at your extreme peril. It is a known joke among university students: A Dean can speak to God, but the secretary at the Dean's Office IS GOD.
<ul><li> One of the most valuable pieces of advice a substitute teacher can ever receive is "Whenever possible, make friends with the school secretaries. They are your most valuable asset for getting assignments at that school.". While some may think this is YMMV, it's not. The school secretary has the ear of every teacher and administrator in the school and their opinion of a substitute can get that person a lot of work, or make it so they never see the inside of that school unless their kid is a student there.
</li><li> Pharmacy reps for the major pharmaceutical companies quickly learn that if they want to get some time with a doctor in order to extol the virtues of a great new medication, they'd better get on good terms with the doctor's secretary. Bringing them chocolate-covered strawberries when dropping off their business card, remembering their birthdays, asking them about their families and <em>remembering what they told you so can ask them how their daughter did in the school play</em>, are all the things that will motivate the secretary to encourage the doctor to give you a few minutes of his or her time.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> was given the role of "General Secretary" by the other members of the Politburo of the newly-formed Soviet Union, because from their point of view, it was a menial functionary position within the Cabinet with little relevance to the political moving-and-shaking of the government. Stalin, however, discovered that this allowed him to staff the key positions in the Soviet government with people who were loyal to him and/or consequently owed him favours; when the inevitable power-struggles came after Lenin's death, Stalin had a power-base to work with that the key theorists and political figures of the party, such as Trotsky, didn't. We all know how that worked out.
</li><li> The party secretary of the Norwegian Labour Party for more than 20 years, Haakon Lie, practically <em>ruled</em> the party (after the same centralistic principles as did Stalin), although he never had any other political positions. The party members respected prime minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EinarGerhardsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EinarGerhardsen">Einar Gerhardsen</a>, but Lie was genuinely <em>feared</em>, and even after he was officially criticized by Gerhardsen, the general assembly of the party dared not oppose him. Having access to all members' personal files certainly helps.
</li><li> According to many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a> legends, these elite warriors and spies would hide in plain sight by dressing as commoners, including gardeners, field workers, and housekeepers, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">these would be the last people suspected of having the ability to tie your ankles behind your head with their pinkies</a>.
</li><li> Michael Faraday, being of low birth, started as a secretary and lab assistant at the Royal Institution, and had to scramble to get tickets to attend scientific lectures. He went on to invent the first electric motor, among many other discoveries in chemistry and electromagnetism. While he did eventually earn an endowed professorship, he refused a knighthood and twice refused to become president of the Royal Society.
</li><li> Court clerks, especially the Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United States, could be considered as a form of an Almighty Janitor. Though officially a clerical position, they have the power to decide which cases get heard. The clerks may do all the case research, write and revise decisions from the judge's notes, and likely learn exactly how to manipulate their assigned judge. Makes one wonder how much they manage to do. Also, clerks are practicing lawyers, and so are especially dangerous.
</li><li> U.S. military examples:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie">greenest of officers</a> outrank even the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">veteran of groundpounders</a>, but will nonetheless usually defer to the judgment of the soldiers who are in the field, have seen combat, and know what they're talking about. Hopefully. It has been said that the mark of a competent lieutenant is that, even when right out of OCS, he listens to his adjutant (a position usually filled by a seasoned NCO) and takes his advice seriously.
</li><li> Even the lowest ranking enlisted MP stationed at a guard post outranks every single person on base when it comes to getting into the base. Unofficial Fourth General Order for Sentries: <em>"I will walk my post from flank to flank, and take no shit from any rank."</em>
</li><li> Also, if a troop is instructing a class, he is the subject matter expert and is the highest ranking in the room (it would still be wise of him to show the proper courtesies to his students however).
</li><li> Joel Clark is a US senior drone pilot instructor who got that position when he was still a private.
</li><li> Army supply staff are rarely promoted beyond E-5 Sergeant, the higher ranks are typically transferred from other specializations due to physical injuries. As long as they control the supplies, they hold the entire base by the balls.
</li><li> Every unit in the US army at the squad, battalion or even entire service level has a special rank known as the "senior enlisted adviser", this is the highest ranking enlisted person in the unit, and serves to advise the commanding officer and act as a liaison between him and the men. They usually have special titles to reflect their statis, e,g. the Chief of the Boat aboard any submarine. Of special note are the senior enlisted advisors of each service branch, such as the Sergeant Major of the Army or the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, the most senior enlisted in their branch of the military, their official pay grade is E-9, the highest enlisted grade, but in protocol terms they are equivalent to flag officers.
</li><li> There is a bit of American military wisdom that states that while the officers are in <em>command</em> of the military, it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">NCOs</a> who <em>run</em> the military, making the NCO corps in general a sort of collective Almighty Janitor.
<ul><li> In addition, at some point during their training, be it at a military academy, Officer Training School, or familiarization training for directly commissioned officers, young officers or officer cadets will be reminded that if they don't take care of their NCO's, <em>then the NCO's won't take care of them.</em>

</li><li> Military humor on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.military-quotes.com/jokes/military-humor.htm#RANK%20RECOGNITION%20MADE%20EASY">rank recognition<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> By custom, Medal of Honor recipients are saluted by <em><strong>everyone</strong></em>, no matter the rank. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Even the President.</a>
</li><li> Bill Crawford was a janitor at the US Air Force Academy. However, in 1976, one cadet, while reading a book on World War II, discovered that Mr. Crawford had in fact earned the Medal of Honor while serving in the Army. It turned out the janitor had single-handedly taken out 3 machine gun emplacements that were preventing his platoon from advancing. He was believed dead, and the MOH was awarded posthumously. However, he had actually been captured and placed in a POW camp until rescue. His badass nature did not falter in the camp, where after being clubbed with a German guard's rifle, he disarmed the guard and beat him unconscious. The reason he hadn't told anyone at the academy that he was a Medal of Honor holder? "That was one day in my life and it happened a long time ago."
</li></ul></li><li> In the Finnish army, the company clerk is the most wanted task for conscripts. They technically run the whole company and have more to say on leaves, promotions etc than usual non-coms and officers.
</li><li> Bodyguards. Their clientele include the rich and famous, government officials, and corporate executives. It doesn't matter that they make far less money than the person they're protecting, if it wasn't for their services, then assassinations would be a <em>far</em> more common occurrence.
</li><li> Utilities operators. You don't want to piss off the guy who controls your electricity or hot water.
</li><li> There's actually a very good chance that your immigrant janitor or cab driver was actually an accredited electrical engineer or doctor back in their home country. Unfortunately they found out that the institution that issued their certification <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessForeignDegree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessForeignDegree">wasn't accredited in Canada, Europe, or the US</a>, so they couldn't legally practice. Yet in spite of this, most <em>still</em> consider themselves way better off than they were back home.
</li><li> If you spend any time in the agricultural industry (and to a lesser extent landscaping) you find out that a lot of menial workers are actually accredited people. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAgriculture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAgriculture">Call to Agriculture</a> is strong.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orlandoserrell.com/index.htm">Orlando Serrell<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was struck in the head with a baseball at the age of 10. Besides having a headache for some time, he developed the ability to keep a perfect memory of everything he experiences. He's in his 40s now and works as a janitor at Wal-Mart.
</li><li> In the Frankish Merovingian dynasty, the Mayor of the Palace was the top officer of the royal household, basically a steward or a seneschal. Sure, that sounds appropriately prestigious, but the Frankish Mayors of the Palace evolved over time to become the real power behind the throne. In fact, the last Mayor of the Palace officially took over the throne from the actual king. His name was Pepin the Short, and he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>'s father.
<ul><li> This wasn't an isolated incident. Many household servants to medieval royalty came to take on a surprising amount of power themselves. The term "Chancellor", which nowadays refers usually to a head of government or a judicial officer, used to refer to, essentially, the king's secretary. "Marshal", usually meaning a top military or police officer, once referred to the guy who kept the king's stables.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in the case of Bill Leasure. On the surface, he seemed like an unambitious traffic cop, who went out of his way to avoid promotion so he could stay at the bottom tier of law enforcement, filling out tickets and incident reports. He actually made his living moonlighting as a <em>criminal mastermind</em>. He did assassinations, committed insurance fraud, was involved with a stolen car ring, and <em>stole luxury yachts</em>.
</li><li> Bill Pennington of Profound Decisions Live-Action Roleplay. He's the head of the Red Caps (site maintenance and set-up), and is known to have amongst other things waded into the waste storage tanks to retrieve the things that keep blocking up the toilets. He's also a really friendly guy. His son Matt (owner of the company) has described his job as "making sure the toilets don't run out of loo-paper".
</li><li> Being a television or radio station engineer doesn't sound too glamorous... until you realize that they have highly specialized knowledge necessary to keep that station on the air and are often among the highest paid employees on staff. Most other employees quickly learn to make friends with the engineer since he can hold you hostage when you need your gear repaired. And gods help you if you decide to outright insult them on-air, as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayVFSLK9YRA">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> host learns the hard way when his co-hosts savage him <em>thoroughly</em> on-air while his technicians mess with his feed as payback.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://kotaku.com/5866158/creator-of-mario-zelda-says-im-retiring-will-make-smaller-games">Shigeru Miyamoto plans to assume a lesser position at Nintendo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, presumably to spend more time developing.
</li><li> According to figures collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a class="urllink" href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/why-did-17-million-students-go-to-college/27634">there are over 5,000 janitors in the U.S with Ph.D.s, other doctorates, or professional degrees.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Nurses. Who do, in fact, run everything. The epitaph of many a failed doctor is angered the nurses. Without them on side (or with them actively hindering you) its nearly impossible to get anything done, and no one will be sympathetic.
</li><li> In hospitals, infection control is <a class="urllink" href="http://mikethemadbiologist.com/2012/09/26/wash-your-damn-hands-and-surfaces-too-or-how-class-bias-can-kill">extremely important<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and can have a huge effect on patient outcomes. While everyone who works in the hospital has a role to play in cleanliness, ultimately the primary responsibility for keeping things clean is on the janitors.
</li><li> Programmers working on free and open source software generally occupy lowly positions in their day jobs compared to the importance of the programs they write. One reason for this is that many software firms require their hired programmers to sign over the rights to any code they write, even "off-duty," in order to avoid competition and cross-pollination between the company's code and the individual's. So it's not uncommon to find hobbyist programmers with non-programming day jobs to get around this.
</li><li> In 1998, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">then-Brigadier General Mattis</a>, a bachelor, stood duty on Christmas so his married subordinate could enjoy the holidays with his family. For those who don't know, standing duty is an <em>extremely</em> low-end job, ususally reserved for newly-minted lieutenant and whatnot. For twenty-four hours, General Mattis was essentially this trope.
</li><li> One customer who got frustrated with being shuttled from one clueless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">corporate VP</a> to another gave up and addressed his complaint to the head janitor. <a class="urllink" href="https://lawrenceblock.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/great-moments-in-contemporary-publishing/#comment-9981">It worked.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In a somewhat twisted example, you wouldn't really expect "Park Ranger" to be a job requiring extreme badassery.
<ul><li> In Africa, where thanks to the lucrative black market for ivory, rhino horn, and other products taken from endangered animals, park rangers are basically paramilitary forces, equipped with things like automatic rifles and rocket propelled grenades, and are regularly up against poachers who may be just as well equipped.
</li><li> US Park Rangers also have to deal with the clever criminals who've realized that national parks are the perfect places to cultivate / manufacture illegal drugs. Eliminating an illicit marijuana farm may involve a running gun battle with automatic weapons.
</li><li> Italian park rangers used to be a simple police force... Whose qualifications required a good dose of badassery and carrying enough firepower that they could have enacted a coup, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golpe_Borghese">as it actually nearly happened<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This is because they have to deal with a number of crimes that are sometimes done by the Mafia, duties important enough that when they were disbanded their job (and almost all their members) was taken over by the Carabinieri, <em>the</em> highest-ranking gendarmerie/police force of Italy.
</li></ul></li><li> Gunpei Yokoi, inventor of the Game Boy, started his career as a janitor.
</li><li> IT specialists in most companies are this. The last thing any boss wants do is accuse their IT staff of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">not doing their jobs</a>. It isn't uncommon for IT specs to <em>deliberately sabotage</em> company systems and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">"fix"</a> it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity">prove that they're doing their jobs</a>. In some companies, they may even have access to the files of every employee working there, <em>including their superiors</em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked.com</a> has <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19528_5-true-stories-that-prove-you-shouldnt-piss-off-it-guy.html">this list<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to show just what happens when people underestimate the i.t. guy.
</li></ul></li><li> Among the cooking staff of a restaurant, the pantry chefs are simultaneously the lowest ranked cooks and the most important cooks in the place. If the pantry chefs don't do their jobs, no one else can either, for they do all the prep work (cutting meat, slicing vegetables, preparing sauces, and so on) that allows the line-cooks to get food out on time.
<ul><li> Dishwashers are also responsible for not just dishes, but often the general upkeep of the restaurant (floors, trash, bathrooms, ect.). It is also up to them to actually get the clean dishes to the line; without them, there are no dishes, glasses, or silverware on the line, all which need to be available at a moment's notice on a busy day.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/louisiana-principals-success-is-a-lesson-in-perseverance/">Gabe Sonnier<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> started off as a janitor at a Louisiana elementary school until one fateful day in 1985, when then-principal Westley Jones noticed his potential. 27 years later, he's now the principal, and continues to study for his teaching degree. Sonnier still stays true to his roots in janitorial duties, however.
</li><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UntoldStoriesOfTheER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UntoldStoriesOfTheER">Untold Stories of the E.R.</a></em> shows, the janitors and maintenance guys can be the difference between losing a patient and saving one in a hospital. The best example was that a janitor just so happened to speak the language that a critically ill woman's husband spoke and managed to get her medical history.
</li><li> Bartenders can make a lot of money in even a dive bar if they are good at what they do. Unlike servers, bartenders get customers when they are at their most liquored up and generally more generous. Combined with the fact the alcohol usually outstrips the price of food by wide margin and the bartenders typically already make a pretty good hourly wage and you have a well paying job if you don't mind working late.
</li><li> Sally Keating wrote the entry that won the 1982 Irish National Song Competition, "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow." It came in 11th place in the Eurovision Song Contest. She was a cleaning lady at Wesley College, an Irish boarding school.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> gets a lot of his mystique from this trope. Though he may have served the Patriots in official capacities as an Ambassador to France and as Pennsylvania's delegate to the Continental Congress, he held exactly <em>one</em> public office in his entire political career: Postmaster General of the United States — a position of some authority, but definitely not the kind of <em>post</em> that one would expect of one of the most revered and influential of the Founding Fathers. His efforts as Postmaster were actually surprisingly important to the Patriots' cause, as he helped set up some of the first official communications networks between the original thirteen colonies, which helped the Colonists foster the kind of national identity that made the War of Independence possible.
</li><li> Unless you're a scholar of rock and roll or a superfan of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>, you've probably never heard of Jason Everman. Constantly removing himself from the circles of friends he easily built, Everman was kicked out of two of the greatest bands of the modern era before they truly hit their strides. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> once offhandedly accused Everman of inflicting mental anguish on the entire band just by being gloomy and distant  no small feat from a band almost defined by its personality disorders and the self-destruction of the accuser in question. Jason turned those two back-to-back defeats into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">motivation required</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">join the Army Special Forces</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdTellYouButThenIdHaveToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdTellYouButThenIdHaveToKillYou">He can't talk about most of his missions</a>, but he used his G. I. Bill money to go to get a bachelor's in philosophy, and according to a recent NY Times piece, plans to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">go be a bartender somewhere</a>. The Almighty Janitor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkTheEarth">walks among us</a>.
</li><li> This trope often applies in tech startups. After all, the engineers and programmers are there to handle the technical end, and there is usually no money to hire someone to handle the office scutwork, meaning that ordering toilet paper, making coffee and vacuuming the server room often falls on the CEO.
</li><li> For a darker example, former Iraqi Air Marshall Georges Sada shared an anecdote in his book, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TU1O0S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Saddam's Secrets<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, about a student who went to a university in Baghdad. There, he ran afoul of a janitor who hated his guts for no apparent reason. Said janitor eventually confronted him and gloated that he was a member of the Ba'ath Party, which meant he functionally outranked the university's own Dean, and could decide whether or not the student flunked his classes.
</li><li> Theoretical physicist <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_J._Glauber">Roy J. Glauber<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was known as the "Keeper of The Broom" in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize">Ig Nobel Prize<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ceremonies, his job there was to swept the paper planes flown over the stage. He missed the 2005 Ig Nobel Prize ceremony as he won the actual Nobel Physics Prize that year.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groom_of_the_Stool">Groom of the Stool<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This was essentially the person who would help the King of England clean himself after using the toilet in the medieval and Tudor periods. Despite the rather unpleasant nature of the role, it was actually a much sought-after position both because it came with many perks, including a high salary and houses (because who's going to do that job for free?), and because the nature of the job <em>also</em> meant that you had very close, intimate access to the King, which could prove very useful and influential.
</li><li> Eunuchs in the court of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina">Imperial China</a> were nominally slaves and servants of the Emperor. In practice, being part of the Emperor's household granted them great authority over the rest of the nation, that many times it was the eunuchs holding the real power as seen in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EunuchsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EunuchsAreEvil">Eunuchs Are Evil</a> trope.
<ul><li> Not just in Imperial China. General <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narses">Narses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was responsible for the brief retake the Italian peninsula from the Goths during the Dark Ages (it was by many standards a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> but he did the job while many others failed). He was not a man of arms: he was an eunuch in charge of the palace stewardship and dealt personally with the Emperor's finances. That would come handy in winning a war, since campaigns need to be financed and armies need to be fed. A job for someone with damn good logistics talent.
