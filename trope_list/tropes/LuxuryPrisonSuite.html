True, it's not the ritziest arrangement, and the girls have to risk their lives battling dragons to earn money for things they want to buy, but it's definitely nicer than the cell Ange was thrown into when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she made it back to the mainland</span>. Evidence of how nice their accommodations <em>can</em> be, however, is reflected in the set-up that Zola (and later Hilda) has, with many luxurious furnishings in her dorm up to and including a private <em>hot tub</em>.

However, there exists a secret enclave in the fifth level called Newkama Land where an inmate lucky enough to find one of the passages to it can gain a reprieve and a small semblance of freedom that is unknown even to the guards. Prior to Luffy's infiltration, it is ruled by Emporio Ivankov, who has the ability to, among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">gender bend</a> people. With this ability, he offers newcomers to his "New Kama land" the opportunity to be whichever gender they choose. The place has several luxuries like the main room, which is a combination of a sit-down cafe and a discotheque, but Ivankov's guests have to follow a few strict rules that prohibit them from actively interacting with the rest of the prison (so as not to blow their cover), at least not without covert movement. (Otherwise, Ivankov is nonbiased as to who may enter.) As of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ivankov and the bulk of the prisoners he had recruited have returned to his homeland, and Straw Hats ally Bentham, better known as former Baroque Works agent Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, has taken over.</span>

He can't even escape through the hole he dug out in the back, fearing the guards installed some kind of guillotine in the wall, so he settles on watching it for decades.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh!

It was originally built by a previous ruler who imprisoned the wife of a powerful noble lord there for treason against the crown and went there to personally "interrogate" her three times a week. Considering she actually did commit treason, that was pretty much the only way to keep her around as his mistress.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>, Lord Vetinari has his dungeons set up like this, for those periodic times when Ankh-Morpork revolts against his rule; he's even convinced the rats to provide room service. Vimes notes that it has been constructed more for keeping the chaos that ensues when Vetinari isn't in power <em>out</em> than keeping a prisoner <em>in</em>. Naturally, Vetinari has installed several secret exits, should he want to leave, but for all intents and purposes, it's the safest place in the city. In fact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all of the locking mechanisms are on the <em>inside</em>, so he can easily prevent anyone unlocking the door from the outside</span>.
<ul><li> Also, Leonard da Quirm's holding "cell." It's in a secret passageway filled with traps that Leonard designed, and he has a spare key for the door. He's quite comfortable, and Vetinari keeps him supplied with all the paint, wood, metal, and paper he needs.
<ul><li> Leonard is an interesting case because he's only imprisoned in the strictest semantical sense of the word. Sure, he's not allowed to leave unsupervised, but as the books note, Leonard is the sort of guy who can't truly be imprisoned unless they find a way to lock up his intellect. What he's got is closer to protective custody; it keeps Leonard's considerable, yet indiscriminate, genius out of the hands of those who would use it for petty, destructive short-term gain, and in the hands of Lord Vetinari, who is occasionally inclined to exploit it for the long-term good of the city, but mostly finds that what the long-term good of the city needs is for no one to actually have access to Leonard's genius.

He even managed to continue the experiments that got him banished in the first place by having materials and equipment smuggled in.

Similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> example above, this is not meant to imply that he is getting special treatment, rather that his normal quarters just suck.

The other characters reason it must be to set a precedent — to establish that such prisoners should be treated well in case she ever falls from power and ends up one of them herself.
</li><li> In the Olivia Goldsmith novel <em>Pen Pals</em>, Jennifer takes the rap for an insider trading charge her boss actually committed. She's assured she'll go to a "country club" prison and when checking in, actually asks if there are messages for her as if it's a resort. Subverted as she meets with the Warden, saying she'll only be there for a few days before her lawyer gets her out but in that time, needs to keep up in work. Thus, she requests a cell with a nice window view, a computer with Internet access and printer, and someone to take her notes and maybe answer her phone. The warden just sits in amazement at how a woman as bright as Jennifer doesn't understand her circumstances and quickly makes it clear this is <em>not</em> going to be a vacation.

</li><li> In <em>Wolves Eat Dogs</em> by Martin Cruz Smith, a wealthy Russian crime-boss has bagged the cell that has been fitted out to comply with European human rights laws.

He's confined to the penthouse of the Presidential Hotel, which he secretly owns through a bunch of shell companies.

This can actually make it much easier to deal with them, as they can be put in lockup for longer periods than normal without them flipping out and turning violent. Later versions of the game added a ranking system to the prison cells based on size and the objects in the cells, and this helps with keeping order in the prison, as prisoners who rate access to nicer cells due to good behavior will stay obedient to keep their comfortable rooms, and other prisoners will try to behave so they can upgrade from normal cells to the cushier ones.

</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, Mayor Sideshow Bob is sent to Minimum Security Prison for rigging the election. Looks more like a college campus than a prison. The local prison Harvard rowing team even asked him to join up for a match against Princeton. It's likely that the place is a prison for "white collar" criminals like corrupt businessmen or, in Bob's case, a corrupt politician.

</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Surprisingly enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. After the Beer Hall Putsch he was tried for high treason and sentenced to five years in Festungshaft (literally "fortress confinement"). Festungshaft was a type of jail that excluded forced labor, featured reasonably comfortable cells, and allowed the prisoner to receive visitors almost daily for many hours. It was the customary sentence for people whom the judge believed to have had honourable but misguided motives. While in prison he dictated most of the first volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MeinKampf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MeinKampf">Mein Kampf</a></em>.
<ul><li> Additionally, on the subject of the legal system not being hard enough on their future Fuhrer, when Hitler was on trial it was basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">free advertising for his Nazi Party and ideals</a> since the case was highly publicized.
</li></ul></li><li> Sharashkas, special prisons in the Soviet Union's Gulag System. As seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstCircle">The First Circle</a></em>, they were used as an incentive for political prisoners with useful scientific and engineering skills. Do well enough, build a lot of nukes and WMD's, and you'll get released. Do bad, and you get kicked down back to the hellish slave labour camps.
</li><li> Exile to Siberia in Tsarist Russia wasn't quite prison, but otherwise it tended to fit this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirLenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> actually thought it was one of the best times of his life as the clean Siberian air and country lifestyle left him a lot of spare time for hunting, philosophizing, and other activities and he left it healthier than he entered- and by "left" we mean "of his own free will" as the security <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">was so lax</a> that it didn't take a great deal of planning to get out, and most prominent revolutionaries either did so easily or eschewed it for the relatively comfortable life there. The fact that so many revolutionaries were sent into exile meant that they all tended to form their own communities which helped new arrivals to settle in (or get them fake ID's to escape with); ironically, the Tsarists basically helped them to form their own prototypical Communist societies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonTrotsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeonTrotsky">Leon Trotsky</a> had a similar if slightly more unpleasant experience, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> - being a known as a violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> and bank robber (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood">how he collected funds for</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the revolutionaries</a>) - got exiled into deeper Siberia, which was colder and more barren, but still only required time and effort to escape from. At least once he did so just by hopping on the nearest train!
</li><li> A fair number of nobles ended up imprisoned like this. In the Middle Ages, the noble may be related to his captor, and nobles were held prisoner primarily to obtain a ransom. Besides, you never knew if your prisoner would one day be holding you hostage. Better to treat him well and hope he'd return the favor in the future.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> most countries operated this as policy (i.e. you had to pay for most things and the more you paid the more you could get) up until round about the 1700 to 1800 period.
</li><li> Cocaine king Pablo Escobar's personal quarters were so good that La Catedral, the prison he was held in, was dubbed the Hotel Escobar. He had agreed to "surrender" himself to the authorities under the condition that the extradition laws in Colombia were abolished, which they were after he bribed several members of the Constitutional Court. He ran his affairs there unimpeded until two of his cellmates were murdered in there; the government kicked the doors in but found out that he was tipped beforehand by his cousin (who had a contact in the National Police) and fled. The hunt for him didn't end until he was shot down in the rooftops of Medellin by the police.
</li><li> In his memoir <em>Wiseguy</em> (which was adapted into the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></em>), Henry Hill goes into detail about the time he served at Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, which was nicknamed "Mafia Manor." How comfy was it? Mobsters got their own special dorm, which was described as looking like a Holiday Inn. Mobsters were allowed to cook their own meals made from gourmet foods smuggled in <em>by the guards</em>. Mobsters didn't have to work if they didn't want to; if they did (for the pay), they could get someone else to do it. And mobsters could use the phone whenever they wanted, and one mobster stored the drugs he was selling <em>in the chaplain's safe</em>. Of course, all of these privileges came at the expense of greasing the palm of the bureaucrat in charge.
</li><li> Boss Tweed, an infamously corrupt New York politician, was said to have his own cook and could even come and go as he pleased while in prison.
</li><li> The system of debtors' prisons in England during the Industrial Revolution. They were notoriously corrupt, and while the truly broke had to beg passersby for food (meals weren't included unless you could pay the guards), wealthy and well-connected inmates had furniture and meals brought in from outside, got drunk, had prostitutes brought in at all hours, and generally enjoyed a standard of living that only the landed gentry could afford.
</li><li> A caveat noted in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamMakepeaceThackeray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamMakepeaceThackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>'s historical novel <em>Henry Esmond</em>, is that while the wealthy like the title character could afford a comfortable confinement, it was at a truly exorbitant price. When their money ran out...
</li><li> This sort of thing is very common in developing countries. Corrupt politicians practically take over the prisons where they're sent.
</li><li> During the War of 1812, American prisoners of war were held in Halifax and allowed to wander around the city as they pleased during the day so long as they returned to their cells in the evening. Not a single man even attempted to flee, and many of them stayed in Halifax after the war ended.
</li><li> Taken a step further in the American Civil War. At times when holding or exchanging prisoners of war was unfeasible, captors would often grant prisoners parole: They would be flat out released and free to go in exchange for signing a paper saying that they will not take up arms against their captors again. Of course, if you got caught violating your parole, <em>then</em> things get ugly. This system broke down later in the war, once Grant and the Union realized that a manpower shortage was the South's greatest weakness. They held onto their prisoners, the Confederates responded in kind, and by the end of the war POW camps on both sides were some of the nastiest prisons to be seen until the 20th century<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ua5i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ua5i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ua5i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The most notorious Confederate POW camp, located in Andersonville, Georgia, had a 30% death rate among prisoners, primarily because of diseases that spread rapidly due to overcrowding and because they lacked the resources needed to provide enough food for the prisoners. The commandant of Andersonville was the only person to be hung for war crimes in the Civil War. For comparison the Union camp in Elmira New York had a death rate of about 25% for largely the same reasons (plus a nasty flood); the similarity was not acknowledged for nearly a hundred years and was officially denied during the investigation into the Confederate camps.</span>.
</li><li> During WWII, Italian prisoners of war kept at a camp in northern New Jersey were frequently given weekend passes to stay with Italian families living in Philadelphia.
<ul><li> This was true after Italy changed side in 1943 and became a "co-belligerent.". They were no longer prisoners of war because Italy was no longer at war against Allies, but they could not just be released so they were given unusual rights and privileges as, technically, they were no longer " imprisoned."
</li><li> In the later periods of WWII, it finally reached a point where German POWs sent to America experienced a better standard of living than their free comrades back on the front (and in the rest of Germany).
</li></ul></li><li> Minimum security prisons are more comfortable than max-security ones, for obvious reasons. Oh, and there's that Austrian Max-Sec prison that looks like an art college dorm....
</li><li> Norway, with its focus on rehabilitation, is especially famous for its prison-hotels:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bast%C3%B8y_Prison">Bastøy Prison<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Norway is basically an island colony with just over a 100 inmates on it, accessible by ferry. The inmates walk free and spend most of their time working the island farms. Even the ferry is operated by one of the inmates and during the night there are only five guards. While most of the inmates are nonviolent, there are some with murder convictions. The most bizarre case is the man who killed another person with a chainsaw. He's the one in charge of all the land clearing on the island, due to his tremendous skill with the chainsaw.
</li><li> Halden Prison: A cell includes amenities such as a television, a refrigerator, unbarred vertical windows that let in more light, and designer furniture. Prisoners share kitchens and living rooms every 1012 cells, jogging trails, and a sound studio. There are cooking and music classes offered. Half the guards are women and guards are typically unarmed because guns "[create] unnecessary intimidation and social distance". Prisoners receive questionnaires that ask how their prison experience can be improved.
</li><li> That case is somewhat justified in that Norway's experimental rehabilitation centres serve as an incentive and teaching tool for good behaviour (brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> prisons, with all the gangs and torture and other such horrors, only end up punishing good behaviour and reinforcing a nihilist might-makes-right way of life, which in turn encourages criminal behaviour) and encourages <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_%28psychology%29">sublimation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - basically, when bad impulses are satisfied in a more acceptable way. Clearly, the chainsaw guy mentioned earlier likes to rip things up with a chainsaw; they just have to make sure he rips up the <em>right</em> things. Keep in mind that Norway also has the lowest criminal recidivism rates in the world, which means that it works — or at least make the prisoners too lazy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">Bread and Circuses</a> to be interested in crime.
</li></ul></li><li> The Tower of London was historically used as one of these. Originally, the Tower was a royal residence, so it was also used as a polite prison (the pretense being that the prisoners or hostages were "guests of the king"). After the kings stopped living there in the Tudor period, conditions got worse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> on Elba, where he was made governor and given a 600-strong guard. After Waterloo, the British cut him down a notch and sent him to Saint Helena in the middle of the Atlantic to live in a damp, crumbling manorhouse. It has been theorised that Napoleon's death may have something to do with the arsenic-laced wallpaper in his Saint Helena residence—the place had a damp, humid climate, perfect for funguses to thrive and metabolise on the Scheele's Green pigment to produce toxic gas and thus slowly kill Napoleon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a>, finally convicted on tax-related charges, began his sentence in a prison where his money and fame brought him all the finer things in life, including the ability to leave if he wanted to. Unfortunately for Al, it all came crashing down when the guards told a visiting official that he was out, but was supposed to return later. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Then he was transferred to Alcatraz</a>, had the crap beat out of him by inmates, and eventually lost his mind to dementia caused by syphilis. Which then killed him when he got out. So... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">crime doesn't pay if you have an undiagnosed case of syphilis</a>.
</li><li> When she was imprisoned for tax evasion, "Queen of Mean" Leona Helmsley hired and bullied fellow inmates into waiting on her hand and foot, just like when she ran her hotels. One even served as her personal secretary.
</li><li> Teresa Giudice of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRealHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRealHousewives">The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a></em> was sentenced to 15 months in the clink for embezzlement. Her first request upon sentencing was to be transferred to the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack"> Orange Is the New Black</a></em>. It was granted.
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="urllink" href="http://dlisted.com/2014/10/21/teresa-giudices-crisis-manager-dropped-her-ass-for-asking-a-judge-to-send-her-to-the-orange-is-the-new-black-prison/">Michael K.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></strong> <em>Teresa Giudice once said, '</em>I dont want to live in somebody elses house. Thats gross<em>,' so Im surprised and disappointed in her that she didnt ask the judge to build her a new prison because she doesnt want to live in somebody elses prison. Thats gross. (Cut to the judge opening a letter from Teresa claiming that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense">some law</a> states that she has the right to serve her sentence in a new prison built for her because used prisons are gross.)</em>
</div></li><li> Despite having the reputation of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison">Tailor-Made Prison</a>, the famous Bastille in the pre-Revolutionary France was actually designed to be a prison made of this trope. It was next to impossible to escape and the inmates' identities were a carefully guarded secret, but most of them were political prisoners and noblemen who had caused embarrassment to someone of higher status, most who could expect to be released when their families paid the right people; others were non-violent criminals who had caused the government embarrassment, and a few were simply insane (as an example, when the Bastille was stormed on 14 July 1789, it housed seven prisoners—four forgers, two lunatics, and the "deviant" aristocrat the Comte de Solages (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarquisDeSade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarquisDeSade">Marquis de Sade</a> having been moved out of the Bastille to a lunatic asylum ten days earlier; de Sade is himself an example of easy treatment, being a high-ranking noble imprisoned for sodomy and poisoning, and was allowed many luxuries befitting his status—he was moved to the asylum for having yelled to a crowd outside the prison on 2 July that the government was killing prisoners in the Bastille when in fact it was not)). Some even rose to high positions in the government after their release, so the wardens were extra careful on how to treat prisoners who could one day become their immediate superiors.
</li><li> Palestinian POWs in Israel got fairly good conditions, including the right to receive an academic education. After Gilad Shalit was abducted and kept in significantly worse conditions, Israel lowered the standards of their POWs too—for instance, those who started their academic studies in prison could finish them, but no-one else could start. Unfortunately, the Israelis have a tendency to cheekily exploit that fact as well: when Palestinian prisoners try to hunger strike in response to whatever current development in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">ArabIsraeli Conflict</a> has upset them, the Israelis provide food, medical treatment, and sometimes <em>intravenous nutrition</em>... forcibly, if need be.
</li><li> The 2014 New Bilibid Prison raids in the Philippines found prisoners luxuriating in carpeted rooms fitted with a 50-inch flat-screen television set, a split-type air conditioner, a home theater system, a sauna facility, a Jacuzzi whirlpool bath, a kitchen with a dining table, wireless Internet access, closed-circuit television cameras and monitors, routers and signal boosters and even <a class="urllink" href="https://rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/herbert-colangco-convicted-crime-leader-drug-lord-bilibid">a recording studio<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> built by convicted drug kingpin Herbert Colangco, who somehow managed to release a couple or so albums whilst behind bars. Apart from guns, these private dens yielded laptops, cell phones and assorted electronic gadgets, broadband sticks, luxury watches and footwear, expensive liquor, illegal drugs, money-counting machines, and large amounts of cash. To call these quarters kubol is to misuse words in order to make their referents invisible. A kubol in Philippine prison language is a tiny makeshift enclosure that symbolically demarcates boundaries more than it offers physical protection against intrusion. <a class="urllink" href="http://opinion.inquirer.net/81028/the-grand-new-bilibid-hotel#ixzz3OlwxlPt0">Read more.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> MCI Concord (in Massachusetts) has a building called The Farm for minimum-security prisoners. It is an actual farm, with cells designed to look like a normal room, and also gives inmates the ability to control their rooms, like turning on/off lights, air conditioning, etc. The Farm allows inmates to learn cooking, and people can even visit a restaurant staffed almost entirely by inmates to eat what they create (corrections officers also dine there). The Farm doesn't even have any walls... but this, in of itself, is a test.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defied">Defied</a> in Italy, at least for mob bosses: they are subjected to the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_41-bis_prison_regime">Article 41-bis prison regime<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, that specifically keeps them isolated from other prisoners and the outside and limits their benefits, including and receiving money over a (small) set amount.
</li><li> The "Vallachi Suite" located at La Tuna Prison in Texas deserves mention. Built in the 60's to hold mob informant Joe Vallachi and isolated from the rest of the prison. While the prisoner is held in a regular cell(with a bed rather than a cot) at night, they get access to adjoining room with sofa's, stereo, television an excercise bike as well as described by one informant a nice kitchen and nice sized bathroom. Though reports about the conditions vary, it's very comfortable living.
