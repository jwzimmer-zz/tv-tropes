One can take that "up to eleven" by grinding for the purpose in order to raise one's experience points or one's character level.
</p><p>In RPGs, one usually gains strength and abilities through repeatedly killing monsters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">over and over again</a>.
</p><p>Forget trying to figure out the right combination of elemental attacks; just walk around a certain area and kill smaller monsters for a week, then pound away at the 'boss monster' as if you were the Incredible Hulk.
</p><p>In video game plots, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> ever has this advantage against monsters.

It is considered extremely rude to level grind and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks">complain a boss is painfully easy.</a>
</p><p>The traditional way of level grinding is to kill lots of a very low level enemy, for example, rats. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slime</a>-type enemies that give out large amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">experience</a> can shorten the process considerably. Given that the second group are always much more likely to be able to actually kill your character at lower levels, a ladder system is usually employed. Modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> have turned to 'Quest Grinding' instead, offering both one-time and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatableQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatableQuest">Repeatable Quests</a> with massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoint">Experience Point</a> rewards compared to simply killing hordes of monsters - but this has simply changed the type of activity players use to grind instead of eliminating the grind altogether.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In such games any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperienceBooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperienceBooster">Experience Booster</a> is worth its weight in gold.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note066w1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note066w1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note066w1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">But don't forget the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier">Money Multiplier</a> to get all that gold more quickly.</span>
</p><p>The act of Level Grinding is probably one contributing factor to the creation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a> can invert the trope, with monsters that scale according to the character's level. This negates the need to grind, but introduces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels">its own set of problems</a>.
</p><p>Note that while the term Level Grinding typically has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">a negative connotation</a>, there's a reason why it's still prevalent to some degree in so many games even today: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools">many players actually enjoy it</a>. Furthermore, because grinding typically doesn't require as much concentration or brainpower as normal gameplay, it can make for an excellent companion activity to other things such as listening to music or podcasts.
</p><p>If the game is unbalanced or mean enough to practically require you to level grind, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding">Forced Level-Grinding</a>, not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity">Fake Longevity</a>. On the other hand, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">Anti-Grinding</a>, where the developers set up something that stops this behavior, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelAdvantage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelAdvantage">Low-Level Advantage</a>. Other times, if the developers give the player a convenient spot to do this with, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling">Peninsula of Power Leveling</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> Black</em> has a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> demons to fight near the end of the game. They are big, purple-ish zombies who hit hard, are tough to kill, but easy to avoid. The source of income in the game is the yellow essence that you gather as you kill enemies, the average enemy gives you about 20 points of essence. These three creatures, once you kill them, give you around 10,000 points of essence. And they respawn after you leave that arena and return, so you just return and kill them seven or eight times until you max out and upgrade all your weapons. Then you can return and max out again to buy all the extra health potions and ninpo items you want. If you're a halfway decent player, you can beat the final stage of the game relatively easy with all the items you bought.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> 2</em> also has an easy way to grind as much essence as you need to max out every weapon and buy as many healing items as you can hold: in one part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier">Airborne Aircraft Carrier</a> level, you come across a long hallway that's blocked from one end by laser beams: if you try to pass them, you naturally take damage and an alarm is triggered, which summons some TAC Ninjas to take care of you. However, the alarm trigger is actually seperate from getting hit by lasers, meaning that if you inch your way right next to the lasers, you can summon as many of them as you want without running out of health in the progress. Not only that, but the ninjas enter the room via a long hallway and take their sweet time getting to you, which easily allows you to kill them in a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargeAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargeAttack">Ultimate Technique</a> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe">Eclipse Scythe</a>.

The mission simply restarts with all of your newly acquired goodies and XP intact with none of the damage. In relatively little time, you can use it to level up enough to beat whatever boss that gives you trouble.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Adventure Game </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The classic <em>Hero's Quest</em> (later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em>) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a> had this. You improved your skills by using them, leading to sights such as the main character working on building up his 'climb' skill by scrabbling (initially ineffectively) at a tree.
<ul><li> Skills in all games were odd ducks: as long as you had a minimum level in any of the skills, you could use and improve it. The difference between low skill and high skill was <em>success</em>: if Weapon Use was 5, then a basic stab might miss or be easily blocked, and if it does hit, it won't do much damage. The only skill that averts the success rate is magic: the higher your magic, the more you can cast before needing to rest or use a potion (skill rate with the individual spells, increases damage, duration or effect).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em>, the only side-scrolling installment, Link has 3 skills (Magic, Life and Attack) which can each reach level 8. Doing this in the first playthrough requires a bit of grinding.
<ul><li> This game was also one of the first action games to introduce leveling and XP, and the developers' inexperience with leveling as a mechanic shows a bit in the game. You lose all experience towards your next level when you run out of lives, which means that grinding low-level creatures becomes the default method for leveling due to its safety. Completing a dungeon means an automatic level-up regardless of the XP needed, which means that with the expanding amounts of XP needed for later level-ups, it's better to level-up naturally up to at least six-levels from the maximum, and then just go back and finally beat the bosses of each dungeon to get the remaining six or fewer level-ups. This adds a bit of uneven pacing to the game as you've gone through over 2/3 of your level-ups before you beat each boss. Most enemies give only trivial amounts of xp (such as 2 pts when you need 9,000), and some give <em>no</em> xp except for when they hurt you, and then they'll <em>drain</em> xp from you.
</li><li> A convenient, if risky, method of early leveling up is killing Bubbles, even in the first Palace. They respawn infinitely, they hold still when you hit them, and they give you a whopping 50 Experience Points each. All they ask in return is sore fingers and whatever magic they eat off you if you screw up. Having the downward thrust makes this substantially easier if you time your jump right.
</li><li> You can also skip returning the crystals to the palaces until the last minute, making getting those 5000, 6000, 7000 and 8000 experience levels a lot easier.

<ul><li> Eyeing that free 5 packs at the end of Score Rewards? Be prepared to grind out about 1000 wins across a month. While the game is generous with Score Rewards at the beginning, the score intervals between subsequent rewards only get wider, reducing motivation to continue. Many players choose to stop grinding after they've gained the unique emblem and card sleeve of the month due to the lowering returns for raising ranked score.
</li><li> Do you desire the Grand Master sleeve and flair? If you're already at Master rank, be prepared to grind to a Master score of 10000, meaning a net of 100 wins across a month.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1mxbp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1mxbp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1mxbp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You can still qualify by the end of the quarter if your Master scores over the three months total 25000 or more, but still, that's at least two month's worth of <em>almost</em> making it to Grand Master.</span> And unlike Score Rewards, this progress can be undone with losing. A bad losing streak, especially in a time when many other Master players are also striving for that rank, can easily undo hours of progress. And once you attain Grand Master, the rank is yours until the end of the quarter, where a new expansion launches and you get reset to Master rank.
</li><li> Increasing your Class Level beyond 100 takes up to dozens of matches per level. Though if you win these matches, you gain more EXP, making the grind a little bit easier.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em>, there are twenty-two separate characters all of whom can reach level 100. This is in fact not the true grind - through proper setup a level one character can beat a level one hundred Exdeath and jump to level 100 in a single battle. The true grind is the equipped abilities - some of the late ones require 500 points to master, and under normal circumstances you get one point a battle. Even on a day when the game gives 4x the reward per battle, it would still require 125 battles to master.
<ul><li> You also have to grind for any of the exclusive level 100 weapons. In order to get them, you need to have 5 battlegen items that have, at most, a 5% chance of being created when you break a level 100 version of the person who's weapon you're trying to make. In addition, you need 5 exclusive "soul" items that will <em>never</em> drop during battle. Instead, you have to go to the second hardest Duel Coliseum track and hope you can get enough Megalixirs, which require 18 medals in a course where you max at 10 per battle. And they don't always show up. And you need <em>20</em> per exclusive weapon. Suffice to say, you're going to be fighting for a long time.

At the rate enemies are normally spawned, you don't get all your techniques until late in the game. If you're <em>really</em> patient, though, it's possible to get the entire moveset with the first two or three enemies you fight simply by punching them a few times and then moving away before you knock them out, and then repeating the process enough times to build up and reset the level bar.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> series revels in this. <em>Diablo II</em> online is basically <em>made</em> of powerleveling. 75% of characters start off like this: Get glitched by a high-level player to beat the game on the highest difficulty at level 1, join a game, go to the second-last room and wait for the other characters to kill things, exit game, go back to step 2. Maybe 0.1% of people actually play the game like you're intended to.
<ul><li> Even ignoring online play, this is pretty much a necessity. Try going through the game without level grinding, you probably won't access even a single rank of the highest level skill. Now try and go through the game on Nightmare with that character.
</li><li> If you play on your own (single player), you will not even get enough experience to keep up with the monsters, forcing you to stop and grind. If you play only in full (eight player) online games, you very quickly outlevel the monsters and stop gaining more levels unless you skip ahead. In numerical terms, you gain <em>over five times</em> as much experience in a full game.
<ul><li> Of course, console commands can trick the game into thinking one's playing a game with any number of players between 1 and 8 while actually going solo. Might make the enemies tougher, but as was mentioned above you'll outlevel them quickly enough.
</li></ul></li><li> In single and multiplay, the better gear becomes more important to keeping up than character stats. Because everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a>, level grinding is just a byproduct of farming.

<ul><li> Best example of this come from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> originating from Korea, notorious for having an atrocious leveling pace. Prime examples are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lineage2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lineage2">Lineage 2</a></em>, which has a leveling pace so bad and arduous that there are many private servers that give players <em>thirty-two times</em> as much experience, money, and loot as the official game yet still contain playtimes roughly equivalent to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>. Add the fact that dying will result in XP loss that can de-level you quickly, even when another player kills you. Such games give rise to the euphemism <em>Korean flavour</em> MMORPG, even when the game isn't from Korea. Examples include :
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flyff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Flyff">Flyff</a></em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em>

</li><li> <em>Helbreath</em>. Player servers have leveling sped up 10 to 20 times to gain levels at least in somewhat average pace.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RFOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RFOnline">RF Online</a>. Given that earlier versions of the game had no side quests and most of the quest requires you to kill a Pitboss (which is only doable with at least a party of 8, if not multiple parties and hope you got the last shot) there is really nothing else to do. On top of that, even on servers with the exp turned up to <em>300 times the normal amount</em> you still need to grind if you ever want to hit that oh-so-coveted level 65, because even at 300X, mobs still only hand out a sliver of exp per kill (and they can one-shot you).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ROSEOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ROSEOnline">ROSE Online</a>. Although players can work together in parties to lessen the time it takes to climb the levels ladder (for everyone involved).
</li><li> Parodied <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/514">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">"free"</a> ones make their money this way, <em>instead</em> of selling the game or subscriptions. When right from the start of the game, gaining a single low level or the most basic of equipment upgrades involves over <em>a week</em> of killing the <strong>same</strong> small monsters or performing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">same tedious chores</a>, suddenly it doesn't seem so bad to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">drop a few bucks into your account and shortcut yourself there.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnarchyOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnarchyOnline">Anarchy Online</a></em>. This game has 200 NORMAL levels, 20 "shadow" levels, 30 "alien" levels (the experience for which can only be gained from a certain type of monster), and also 70 "research" levels, for a grand total of... 320 levels of some sort that can be obtained!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> had you grinding from level 1. Add the fact that it can be <em>really</em> hard to level (for most jobs) without other people to help past 20-25, and the fact that if you die, you lose EXP, and even sometimes level <strong>DOWN</strong>. However, many tweaks to the game's system have made leveling easier, as well as many of the additions made with the <em>Wings of The Goddess</em> expansion that make it possible to level reasonably well on your own past level 55.
<ul><li> The advent of Abyssea has made level grinding much easier. Before, the best XP parties could make 20,000-30,000 XP per hour, average parties making 5,000 to 10,000 XP per hour. (For reference, it takes 156,000 XP to go from 79 to 75.) In Abyssea, players can earn up to 60,000 XP per hour fairly easily. To say that this has energized the player base is an understatement, people look forward to grinding now.
</li><li> At least for the first couple of expansions, FFXI employed XP scaling, and you didn't get any XP for killing creatures the game considers "weak" relative to your level. Past a certain (not terribly high) level, "weak relative to your level" pretty much translated to "anything a player would actually be capable of killing solo" (and then fairly shortly thereafter to "anything that can be killed by 2 or 3 players rather than a full party"). It was hard to level outside of a party past level 14 or so, and practically impossible to get much past level 20 that way.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> generally averts grinding for the regular process: you never need to stop and kill mobs with nothing but killing going on. You always get a batch of quests, do them, then move on to a different area with a new batch. However, it packs several other kinds of grind:
<ul><li> PvP functions as an alternate levelling process, but you only have a scant handful of battlegrounds to do repeatedly in order to level up. Once at level cap, you do endless repeat of same old battlegrounds to farm your PvP gear.
</li><li> Dungeons: during levelling you can do with doing each of them once or twice at most, but once you are at level cap, here comes the grind - although the amount of dungeons is higher than at any lower level range, you do them repeatedly for gear. And then upgrade to doing the raids repeatedly for gear.
</li><li> Reputations: they are obtained by settling down and killing a ton of specific kind of mobs in the specific location, the epitome of grinding. You get gear and collectibles.
</li><li> Alternate gear tokens: the assortment changes with expansions, but they often have both something that drops from nearly every mob in the expansion pack as well as more zone-specific. You can trade in hundreds or thousands of them for more gear.
</li><li> Resource gathering: mostly serves to be sold for cash, however occasionally also yields rare resource to get crafted into high tier gear. It also gives small amount of XP, but using that for levelling is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a> rather than a main method.
</li><li> If you <em>really</em> want, you can still level up with regular old mob grinding, although you need to change location once you outlevel the mobs. You can <em>almost</em> do it by moving from one kind of boar to another, but there are a few boar-less gaps in the chain.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>, while your skills train passively at a rate determined by your attributes, there is significant grinding to be able to obtain enough cash, faction reputation, raw materials, and other such things to be able to purchase or build any items.
<ul><li> Players have discovered a way to basically "farm" the best subjects for grinding. In 0.0 security space (Free-for-all PvP and player owned) NPC pirate ships can pay anywhere from a few hundred thousand ISK to over a million. By wiping out spawns until one with multiple high-bounty battleships appear, and then only killing the battleships, corporations with 0.0 space can basically create a perpetual money factory. This is due to the fact that there a few set spawn compositions the game loads whenever a spawn has been completely cleared. But when a spawn is only partially destroyed, instead of changing the makeup of the spawn the game just "refills" it, ensuring that high profit spawns stay high profit.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar">Nexus War</a></em> series averts the obvious expressions of this trope only to use a whole bunch of less obvious ones. There's a clearly defined level cap that most characters reach fairly quickly, after which additional experience becomes useless except for bragging rights. However, the reward for leveling consists of Character Points (which can be traded for skills, spells, etc.), and players can also get Character Points by doing <em>nearly anything</em> often enough. Characters gain bonuses equivalent to levels for doing enough killing, vandalism, door repair, lockpicking, etc., etc. There are even bonuses for dying enough times, and so there are groups devoted to <em>dying as much as possible</em> that make up the bulk of the people visible outside in some cities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>. You'll regularly see things like people setting line after line of fires just to get their firemaking skill up, or spending hours mining ores, smelting them, crafting them and selling them just to get those three skills going... It could be nearly king of this trope — according to one of the top players (who has maxed out every single skill), it takes at least 3000 hours to max out every skill (level 99) in the game, and that is if you only grind out the most efficient way possible for every single level.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2k0u4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2k0u4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2k0u4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It takes about <em>6.5 million</em> experience to level up to 92, and level 99 requires <em>13 million</em> experience. So if you are at level 92, you are still <em>halfway</em> to the max level. Cue many memes of "In RS, 92 is half of 99".</span>
</li><li> As a MMORPG, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline">Phantasy Star Online</a></em> had a lot of grinders trying to catch up to the sharkers/Action Replayers when it was first released. The usual method of doing this was to equip the low-leveled character with a handgun or a rifle, go into multiplayer mode with a character who had beaten Normal mode, and employ hit-and-run tactics on the enemies in the second or third levels while the higher-leveled character stayed back and picked off the faster enemies. Since exiting the room caused the enemies to turn around and slowly march back to their starting positions while retaining all damage done to them, it was easy to exploit. There was a catch—you couldn't enter multiplayer on Hard Mode, where enemies gave eight times the experience, until both characters were level 20 regardless of that difficulty being unlocked in single mode. The game's Normal mode was so easy that grinding did you little good until Hard Mode was available.
<ul><li> The game also had a rather ridiculous alternative to level-grinding: Simply handing a new character a maxed-out Mag (a piece of equipment that, by feeding it various items, could be customized both in looks and stat boosts) and a piece of armor with some high-end Slots (which provide even <em>further</em> stat boosts, including to HP and TP) could turn them into something comparable to an unequipped character 20-30 levels above them.
</li></ul></li><li> The MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeDynasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeDynasty">Jade Dynasty</a></em> (which is adapted from the Chinese <em>Zhu Xian</em> and its English equivalent <em>Celestial Destroyer</em>) actually subverts this somewhat by giving the player a <em>built-in bot</em> at level 3, which is useable until level 90, at which point it starts using energy that has to be replenished. The bot even uses health and spirit recovery potions for the player, enabling someone to go to sleep with the bot running and wake up a few levels higher and much richer. However, since mobs give less experience and items as you level (up to no experience or items at all since your level is much higher than theirs), the bot cannot be used to avoid grinding completely.
</li><li> While the low cap (level 20) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> tends to lead to less level grinding, mobs have the ability to gain XP and even levels by killing players. This led to the odd strategy of players leveling up the mobs by repeatedly killing <em>themselves</em>.
<ul><li> It's called <a class="urllink" href="http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Death_leveling">death leveling<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and gained infamy when it was used by players in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>. Mobs give XP based on the mob and player levels, with much lower-level mobs giving no XP. In the tutorial area of <em>Prophecies</em> there are no mobs that can award XP past level 16 and there are not enough quests to make up the difference. Players began aggressively death-leveling Charr, sometimes as many as twenty at a time, in order to kill them for a few measly XP. Play time estimates vary, but have been cited as requiring as much as <em>710 hours</em> to reach level cap. Arenanet eventually recognized these players by granting them the title "Legendary Defender of Ascalon".
</li><li> A less aggravating grind is needed to get a maxed Survivor title, IE reach a certain amount of XP without dying. The first level of this title is reached at the level cap (20), but the highest level of this title is only awarded if you gather enough XP to reach level 100 if there was no cap, namely 1,337,500 XP. While this technically can be done just playing normally, you'll likely die at <em>some</em> point that way. Originally a single death would permanently lock a character out of this title track, but it has since been adjusted to simply reset the counter to 0. If players don't want to store up quests and XP books, it's best to find an area with high-level-low-threat mobs and grind them.
</li></ul></li><li> Though it flirts with being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">Allegedly Free Game</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shaiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shaiya">Shaiya</a></em> fits here. There are four difficulty modes which are unlocked as a player advances along the leveling curve, each one bringing more benefits and challenges. The problem is, each difficulty mode sends the character back to the very beginning of an unimaginatively-written story, and the leveling pace is even <em>slower</em> to compensate for the power-ups. Some Shaiya players think that this justifies powerleveling, some do not. And some candy-coat level-grinding with dungeon raids involving a handful of very powerful veterans doing the heavy lifting for a number of new meat.
</li><li> At first, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em> seemed to avert this trope - you got FAR more XP for actually accomplishing missions, many of which involved activities besides just killing mooks (such as disabling bombs, sabotaging alien ships, etcetera), than you did for wandering around killing everything you saw. That is, until the Crafted Travel Powers cropped up. In order to actually make the darn things, you have to kill tens of thousands of the right type of baddies to get the drops to make the components to make the components to make the Crafted Travel Powers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>. Although most of the progression is done through storyline "Episodes", once you reach the level cap there's a <em>lot</em> of grinding to get Marks of Exploration or Emblems in order to get better equipment for your starship.
<ul><li> Replaced now with Dilithium, which is used in all the various ways to get better equipment for your ships.
</li><li> What's old is new again. Marks of Exploration are back, but just called '&lt;Faction&gt; Marks'. The Dilithium's still there, though, and given time, effort and the right decisions, you can make a good amount of both.
</li><li> This is ultimately one of the biggest complaints about the second expansion, <em>Delta Rising</em>. Unlike the road to Level 50, trying to get to Level 50-60 requires a lot of work just to get up to the next level. This has angered players for such a sudden turn of ideals.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> initially had a problem where you could get the next set of contacts only after you reached a certain level but it was possible to complete all the missions from your present contacts long before you had enough XP to level (especially if you were a solo player), so the only option, if you didn't team up with someone on their missions, was to randomly go around picking fights with mooks on the streets until you levelled up which could get real boring real fast. Subsequent updates of the game have drastically changed this: there are now more contacts, Newspaper/Radio missions are always available once you've reached a given (low) level, and you can always play in player-made Architect scenarios. As a result of this, pretty much the only time you actually see heroes/villains fighting mobs on the streets is if they're trying to get the last few XP points needed to level, they're on a Kill X Number of Y mission, or they're badge-hunting.
</li><li> Zynga games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaWars">Mafia Wars</a></em> get to be this after a while, especially if you're unwilling to spend real money on what are essentially casual games.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiUserDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiUserDungeon">MUD</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lusternia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lusternia">Lusternia</a></em> takes this to an extreme. Level grinding becomes progressively easier as you go on: while you technically gain much less experience per kill, the chance of performing critical hits ramps up <em>massively</em>, increasing the speed of said kills (the most powerful crit you can get does a whopping 32x damage). However, once you reach level 100, you become a Demigod, and experience is replaced with "essence". A lot of the unique Demigod abilities require essence to buy, meaning you have to hunt an awful lot just to unlock them: more insidious is the fact you <em>lose essence when you die</em>, and if you lose enough you'll be kicked back down to level 99 and lose all your neat abilities. Most level 100 players refuse to go outside their organizations unless they have a huge buffer of essence, and there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer">gank-squads</a> organized specifically to target new Demigods. Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> is a necessity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline">Air Rivals</a></em>, and how! The level grinding there is so intense after level 75 and specially at 8x levels that even the own developers of the game (which are, as you might guess, <em>Korean</em>), decided to add new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling">maps of power leveling</a> for players to get to the so-desired level cap of 110. Even with that, the American server (<em>Ace Online</em>) has a PERMANENT 200% EXP BONUS for everyone below level 75 and it gets reduced to 50% on weekends after that point. Geez.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> is no exception to the trope; not only do you have to level grind just to get access to higher level quests, but if you plan to take on side jobs like cooking or weaving, you have to level up your skills in those jobs as well just to be able to make better items. However, the ways to effectively grind are not "kill many enemies" nor "make many items" so much as, for combat classes, "Seek out FATE events obsessively" and for crafting classes, "Burn all your daily leve allowances on good crafting levequests."
<ul><li> With A Realm Reborn, there are enough quests and rewards that you can get your first combat job to the level cap with minimal (if any) grinding. Every <em>other</em> combat job after the first one? Grind away!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em> plays with this. Enemies, especially single or double enemy groups, give incredibly low amount of experience, and by the time the player reaches around level 30, which is possible even in the early game, they'll be needing several thousand experience, if not several hundred thousand experience points. This is especially irritating for the more defensive classes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">Feca</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodVoodoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodVoodoo">Sadida</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenMaster">Pandwa</a>, ect) as killing large groups of enemies quickly becomes a chore. This means that Holiday events will result in surges of high amounts of experience, and the rest of the time, you'll be scrounging for a single level. Then again, the game justifies this: most of your stats - including HP, chances of critical hits, and even evading attacks - depend on your equipment, so the player is encouraged to find equipment that suits their character build rather than constantly putting focus on leveling up.

Kill, sacrifice the corpses or eat them when you grow hungry, repeat until the level is full of puddings and your max HP is wherever you want it (usually in the six-figure region); the repeated sacrificing of corpses can also be used to gain spellbooks and artifact weapons, and to increase your intrinsic armour class.

Once the Mages learned group-effect spells like FIR2 and HRM2, many of the encounters provided quick experience boosts. Later on, the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> was available in the Ice Cave, where a fixed battle with the EYE boss could be repeated for thousands of easy experience points.

This is partially because the PCs start out as weaklings who get offed in the first battle, and partially because <em>FFII</em> has a unusual leveling up system: The team only gets HP bonuses if they take damage in battle, so grinding usually revolves around party members beating <em>each other</em> up in order to grow stronger.

As a result, simply putting a book on top of the 'A' button and going away for a few days will leave the player with four maximally-leveled characters quite early in the game. However, this will leave the party with awful base stats, since the absence of Summons means no good stat bonuses and spells.

Luckily, the Level-Up passive ability makes it a little less painful.
</li><li> The way the game's ability-system works (passive abilities like Auto-Haste and Auto-Regen are learnt from armour and accessories and AP earned in battle) actually provides some <em>incentive</em> for doing this, as you will want the most beneficial abilities (again, Auto-Haste and Auto-Regen) for your characters before entering a dungeon, and will generally only have one of the item teaching the relevant ability at a time.

</li><li> There's also a place in the Henne Mines with a set of four jellies that, as long as you set your gambits up correctly, will spawn forever.

Combine this tactic with repeating the quests mentioned in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling">Peninsula of Power Leveling</a> entry, and you'll be able to easily grind out the levels of your newly-acquired characters at the same time.

However, since most of the best cards are only randomly dropped by enemies, the net effect is the same: a lot of time spent wandering around in the wilderness killing random monsters until your deck is up to par.
<ul><li> You can also explicitly grind 'recipes' in order to cause specific cards to appear. This is the only reliable method to acquire good revival items (such as the absolutely vital Sacred Wine: 100% Revive + 500 HP).
</li></ul></li><li> Level Grinding appears to have found its audience: a Gamespot review for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a> 2</em> points out that the game seems designed for fans of the process.
<ul><li> It's not really necessary though, as clever usage of skills and accessories will work <strong>far</strong> better in combat than level grinding. The bonus dungeon, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Seraphic Gate</span>, is a very good example of this.
</li><li> Even so, there comes a moment in the game where four of your main characters (two in one chapter, two in the next) leave your party. Depending on how high their level is, you can get some pretty powerful equipment. The problem? You can get game-breaking equipment this way...but you need to level the characters to levels 40 (for the first set) and 45 (for the second set).

<ul><li> In general, with a few quirks varying by game, the series' leveling system follows the logic of having successful uses of a skill go toward increasing that skill's level. (Sneaking around will increase your Sneak skill, casting Destruction spells will increase your Destruction skill, etc.) Then, every ten increases of a skill level goes toward increasing the character's overall level. However, some skills (mostly those outside of standard combat-related skills) require intentional grinding, such as Enchanting and Alchemy. If you want to grind them, you'll need to acquire/purchase all of the necessary components and then use those skills over and over.

IE, increase your skills up to and beyond the point where you <em>could</em> level up, but don't. Enemies will remain scaled to your level, but your <em>skills</em> will be far beyond what you should have at that level. As sleeping is the means of leveling up, this leads to the world being saved from a horde of feeble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell">Legions of Hell</a> by a strangely competent insomniac. Additionally, a first-level character in <em>Oblivion</em> can become the Archmage of the Mage Guild, Master of the Fighters Guild, leader of the Thieves Guild, Listener of the Dark Brotherhood, and Grand Champion of the Arena. At the same time. The disadvantage to this is that the equipment and rewards available will always be of the lowest quality, but it sure beats leveling up only to find yourself getting demolished by suddenly-even-stronger enemies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> overhauls the series' standard system to focus on skill grinding AND ONLY skill grinding. There are 18 skill trees; 6 for each of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">Fighter, Mage, Thief</a> classes, one of each for crafting, and two of each for defense. To level up a skill, players simply have to perform a successful application of a skill (hit the target, deal or deflect damage, buy, sell, and craft items, etc.). Each time a skill is leveled up, the player character gains an experience point; get ten of these and the player character levels up, getting the option to increase 10 points of Health, Magic, or Stamina, and earning a skill perk. Once again, leveling up non-combat skills alone can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels">Empty Levels</a>, but it is much harder to accidentally do than in <em>Oblivion</em>. In the 1.9 patch, players are given the option to "Legendary" any of their maxed skills, resetting it back to 15/100 but retaining the experience points and perks earned from the skill.

A repeatable encounter with 396 midlevel fighters — certain death for a low-level party, but no particular threat to a party with good armor and group-effect spells — nets the party 65535 experience points for a victory; as that suggestive number implies, XP per battle are capped and no other battle even comes near the cap. It thus becomes an obvious strategy for players to repeat this one encounter over and over instead of seeking out more dangerous and less rewarding fights.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em>:

Taking the appropriate skill set and immunities into a fight is generally vastly more important than having a high level. Obviously, this can lead to <strong>skill</strong> grinding instead.
</li><li> The Answer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Persona 3:FES</a> is pretty much a forced level grinding session to get yourself back into the 70s, due to bosses that have high chances of evading their weaknesses and very hard hitting attacks, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">lack of a persona compendium</a> that makes covering and exploiting weaknesses much harder.
</li><li> Can be played to trope in the offshoot, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga">Digital Devil Saga</a></em>. The skills you need to survive the combination kill of the random encounters in the Karma Temple are near the end of one of the branches of the skill tree. Lack the skills, and you're forced to grind your way to them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a>: Innocent Sin</em> doesn't really <em>require</em> much level grinding, and you can finish the game with your characters in the mid-60s of levels (out of a possible 99), but if you want to see the high-level content like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">Armageddon fusion spell</a>, be prepared to <em>grind</em>. By the end you will need hundreds of thousands of XP per character per level, and the highest-level area (which is optional) provides enemies who offer maybe 3,000 XP to each character per encounter. One encounter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAllusion">Alice</a>, offers a lot more XP... but she is painfully rare even when you do everything to manipulate encounter rates. The "easiest" trick to grinding is to let all but your leader die so the XP doesn't get divided up, and then he can gather all the high-level stuff for everyone else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> is fond of throwing The Reaper at you if the AI suspects you're level grinding. Unfortunately, some amount of grinding is required if you want to access higher-level personae — the first Star persona is level 39, and you'll need the persona to max the Social Link (the game's other major challenge).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series accentuates this trope by letting you start a battle with a weak Pokemon, knock out a high-level enemy with a strong one, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience">have both Pokemon earn experience points</a>. On the downside, you need to have battled your way to the higher-level locations first.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> side-games, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a></em> and <em>XD</em>, actually <em>avert</em> this trope for the most part - while you can have level grinding, the Pokemon you can catch are as high a level as the area opponents, meaning you can go through the game with just using Pokemon as you catch them rather than training them. The only real point where it does require leveling is against the penultimate and ultimate bosses, which take a leap of levels over the next best opponents.
</li><li> The rom hack <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonCrystalEnhanced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonCrystalEnhanced">Pokémon Crystal Enhanced</a></em> has the level curve set so high that you must grind for a large amount of time wherever you go. This is made easier in the post-game, where you can find a cave that contains only the exp-rich Chansey and Blissey for easy grinding to level 100.
</li></ul></li><li> All the Digimon World games sans the first one fall into this. The DS games, however, take this to never seen extents. The random encounter rate in these games is fixed, but very high, and no way to repel enemies. The areas you explore are very large, with no map whatsoever. Plus, the enemies give very low experience, while the experience needed in order to level up grows exponentially (ironically, beating the weakest enemy in the game is enough to level anything from 1 to 3). The later bosses have much higher stats and skills than you'd have without Korean MMORPG-levels of grinding. A simple test of beating the game with no random battles and following the right paths in the maze-like dungeons shows that the main story can be beaten in two hours or so, and the post-story mandatory missions in another hour or so. In a game that a proper raised PvP team may require over 100 hours of gameplay, just by playing random battles and Farmville-like training.
<ul><li> It shows something when, even if you use the code to start the battle with only 1 exp point remaining to the next level, it still can take more than one hour to have a digimon reach Lv. 99 ONCE. Because if you want to max you stats, you'll be leveling from 1 to at least 70 several times, to say nothing of using the cross DNA evolution to learn skills you normally wouldn't be able to.
</li></ul></li><li> To keep up its parody status <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LinearRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LinearRPG">Linear RPG</a></em> does make you grind. Going straight will cause you to die. Best to end the game at level 40 which means there's a bit of running back and forwards. No really.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizardry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizardry">Wizardry</a></em> 1 to 7 and Gold are just jam-packed with grinding. In fact, if you don't want to get pounded just by going through doors, you'll spend hours just 'hanging' on the first floor, killing rats, bats, rogues and plants until you CAN go through doors.

</li><li> <em>Wizardry 8</em> allows it, but discourages level-grinding by throwing geometrically difficult opponents at the party the longer they hang out in a particular area; in particular, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave">noob cave</a> monastery and the roads between settlements.

The combination of tricks like these and non-random enemy encounters make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> a <em>very</em> easy game to level grind on.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> is basically 99% grind and 1% story.
<ul><li> In the first game, wandering too far from the first castle before gaining a level or two from Slimes will result in a quick, depressing death at the hands of... a Spooky.
</li><li> The grinding is most apparent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV">Dragon Quest IV</a></em>. Due to the unique chapter set-up, you'll have to do the pre-journey grind FIVE SEPERATE TIMES.
</li><li> <em>III</em> for the GBC has 150+ medals to collect. If you want to obtain all gold medals, prepare to not just fight lots of monsters, but to make <em>sure</em> you keep the <em>right kind</em> alive to the end of the fight so the right medal drops. And if you do get them all, the game's most powerful dragon gives you the "ultimate reward": He says he's bored and goes to sleep.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVI">Dragon Quest VI</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobSystem">Job System</a> uses the number of battles won rather than experience to increase a job's rank, but the catch is that these battles have to be against a challenging enemy (no going back to the very first area to beat on slimes, unless you somehow recruited a level 1 character). This is done by giving every region a hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelCap">Level Cap</a> where battles no longer count for characters of that level or higher. The earliest location where the cap is 99 is the Spiegelspire, itself reached late-game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">IX</a></em> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Each character can reach Level 99 in each job. There are 16 jobs. For comparison, beating the final boss is feasible at Level 50. After completing the main game, Level 99 characters can restart at Level 1, but keep all of their skills. This is the only way to maximize all of the many in-game skills.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> can become this at times. At least as an inexperienced player who may not collect all the djinn, you will require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>. In <em>Golden Sun: TLA</em>, you can grind until level 99 in the turtle cave, which isn't really hard considering the insane amount of exp Wonderbirds give, if you want to. It isn't required.
<ul><li> Then again, if you're a veteran dungeon crawler and just kill everything that comes your way without ever running from a fight (not hard since you recharge PP to heal between combat), you may find yourself <em>overleveled</em> for some parts without <em>ever</em> going out of your way to grind. In <em>TLA</em> you may be so lost during the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">trident sequence</a> that by the time you meet Isaac's team you're ten levels past him.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulBlazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulBlazer">SoulBlazer</a></em> allowed level-grinding. While monsters that spawned from lairs would stay dead once killed, some monsters did not spawn from lairs, and these would respawn every time your character left and re-entered the dungeon. Because the requirements for each successive level increased roughly exponentially through the game, however, spending several hours of grinding in one area would be completely negated by a few minutes of grinding at the start of the next area (where the monsters would generally suddenly offer 5-10x more XP).
<ul><li> Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IllusionOfGaia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IllusionOfGaia">Illusion of Gaia</a></em>, did not allow level grinding at all. Each permanent stat increase was gained after clearing an area of a dungeon, and there were a finite number throughout the game (any missed stat increases were granted anyway on arrival at the dungeon boss, so underlevelling was avoided too).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terranigma">Terranigma</a></em> allowed level-grinding even more freely than Soulblazer did. ALL the monsters would respawn when Ark left the current area of a dungeon, and the XP requirements were nowhere near as exponential as before; less than an hour of grinding in Tower 5 would mean that Ark was capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">Cherry Tapping</a> the first boss, Shadowkeeper.
<ul><li> On the other hand, since your current level is a major part of the damage formula, it's extremely easy to end up doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> to every enemy in a new location if you're not sufficiently leveled up.

The monsters get progressively harder as you enter floor areas. You get item rewards at the Item Store on Special Deals if all 3 characters are over level 60 for The Earth Hammer, at level 70 they get The Shock Box, level 80 gets them Ogre Flute, and finally level 90 gets them The Black Box. Good luck spending hours to getting those items. Especially when you fight Crystal Ooze monsters on floor 5.

It doesn't even need the player be there to kill the monsters. Once you reach the city surrounded by attacking giants, go to the ramparts near the gates. Equip all the infinite ammunition items you have available and have those characters set to attack automatically with ranged weapons on aggressive creatures using the game's script feature. Other characters in your group should be set not to attack (no sense in wasting ammunition). Once they start attacking the offscreen (and defenseless) giants and killing them unopposed, go watch a movie.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SepterraCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SepterraCore">Septerra Core</a></em> has a wonderful level grinding spot - the Smelting Complex.

Since all the enemies are mechanical, Led and Grubb can tear them apart with Repair, earning you large amounts of gold and EXP in the process.
</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> game has noteworthy grinding spots. <em>Xenosaga II</em> in particular has the Dammerung, an area in which only Shion is usable the first time you go through. Because of how the EXP is normally divided, in this particular dungeon Shion effectively gains 300% EXP - and everyone else gains 225%! Naturally an excellent place to gain some extra levels. It's a nice option to have.
<ul><li> It is also worth noting that everything in the Dammerung is weak against Shion's attacks; it doesn't take very long until she one-shots everything with her basic attacks. And don't worry if you passed that area up before you discovered it — you can go back to it using the Encephelon. One might wonder if the devs did this <em>on purpose</em>.

Plus if you level up too much, the game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> due to an oversight: the other potential PCs level up as you do. At level 42, the cleric learns a spell that restores all his HP — and for no good reason, also all his MP. He's essentially immortal at that point. The other potential PCs also sometimes steal your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a>, requiring you to duel to take them. If the cleric ganks one late in the game, he's literally impossible to beat, since the AI isn't dumb enough to forget it has healing spells.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>, while not having explicit character levels, forces you to kill the same monsters over and over to get the weapons or armor made from their parts. Also, one gains experience in the form of real-life experience in killing the monsters, such that extremely good players often take on a high-level monster with no armor at all, just to show off.
<ul><li> <em>Monster Hunter Tri</em>'s online multiplayer required you to grind "Guild Points" to unlock the more next "level" of quests and monsters. Since you used the same character for both single and multiplayer, a maxed out singleplayer character would find the early game multiplayer trivial since you had already grinded the same monsters in the singleplayer. But it also made the singleplayer trivial since a maxed out multiplayer character fought advanced forms of the same monsters as well as multiplayer exclusive monsters and unlocked equipment far better than anything in the singleplayer. Lesson to be learned? Jump straight into multiplayer, come back later and curb stomp your way through the singleplayer.

Besides, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> is on the Gallery's last floor, plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">a couple of powerful summons</a>. If you are up to the challenge, no matter how many Cruxis spells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Daos</a> uses against you, you will be able to kill him with a butter knife.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> included a pretty boring grind: if you don't slaughter the entire Dalish settlement, the Elven emissary will appear in your party camp and accept "crafting materials" to upgrade Elven troops' equipment for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a>. Now, "crafting materials" include Elfroots, which are available for 60 copper pieces in <em>unlimited quantity</em> at the Elven camp, and each batch of 89 pieces (called "Give all Elfroots") nets you <em>880 XP</em> (meaning it costs only 112 gold to grind from level 0 to the level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">cap</a>—roughly an eighth of the transaction volume you can potentially have in single playthrough). So, just go to the Dalish camp, buy an inventory full of Elfroots, return to the party camp and grind. Not that there's much reason to do so, as you'll probably be about level 20 by the time you unlock this option and the cap is only level 25. The Grey Warden, in fact, is probably better served by not leveling (or at least not spending the skill and ability points gained by leveling up) until you progress on to the expansion so you can buy more of the powerful new abilities that get unlocked.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em>, trying to 'skip' to the labyrinth's next floor without having explored a substantial amount of the one you're on will ensure swift death. Oh, and the only way to earn money in the game is to sell off items dropped by monsters. A game where sidequests are arguably a time-consuming practical necessity for the rewards, loot, and exp potentially gained by completing them. You'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">need</a> the lot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em>, you might have to level grind at the most rewarding easy spot available, which, by the time you reach the Factory, happens to be Star Hill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToKrondor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToKrondor">Return to Krondor</a></em> will have you doing this a lot, especially in the first four chapters. You can easily spend hours going through doors and getting into random fights, in the hopes of getting to the next level. At least by going up a number of levels, you will have a higher number of weapons strikes, and more effectiveness with weapons and magic. There are less and less opportunities to level grind as you progress through the game, which may or may not be a good thing.
</li><li> One of the easier (if patience-wearing) methods to employ in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardryLabyrinthOfLostSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardryLabyrinthOfLostSouls">Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls</a></em> if you don't want to die as one hit kills (for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Hayate</a> and harder enemies in the above floors) by the fourth floor of Shin's Dungeon, considering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> nature of the game. Doesn't hurt to have a Bishop either, as they gain a very useful ability in later levels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivieraThePromisedLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivieraThePromisedLand">Riviera: The Promised Land</a></em> has a grinding <em>hell</em>. Your characters' stats increase via "Skill Up" from using certain weapons or items for certain amount of time. Your items are breakable, so you have no choice but to spend countless time grinding in a training room to preserve them for real fights. Worse off, your inventory is very limited and you quickly have to discard some of your items away. This means that you want to frequently grind everyone as soon as you have grindable items in order to open up the room for newer ones
<ul><li> Your full party has 6 members, two that don't join until the end of chapter 2 and the beginning of 3. Because you never know what item teach which skill to them before they join, Serene and Cierra may end up losing some grindable stats forever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">if you've discarded wrong items.</a>

Thing is, both the main story and <em>Reverse/Rebirth</em> are beatable at about half there for anyone reasonably skilled with the card system. So if you're someone that likes to max out levels, get ready for lots of level grinding, pointless for anything other than just getting the levels, since there are no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">bonus bosses</a> to fight. Not only that, but there are no really quick leveling strategies such as the tech points that the original game has, and eventually the bonuses you get for leveling up stuck having any practical effect in speeding up battle completion. (Riku's attack points max at 30 and Sora doesn't even get attack points.) HD 1.5 ReMIX ups the pain by linking Trophies to max levels for both Sora and Riku.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series keep grinding entertaining by use of the Item Worlder, which provides unlimited randomly generated dungeons while also boosting your character's equipment. You also have some choice in the level of the enemies you fight since they are relative to the power of the item.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gyromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gyromancer">Gyromancer</a></em>, you're going to have to do considerably more than just chase the objectives if you want to get to the end. Stages refresh themselves when you leave, so you can fight the same monsters repeatedly. Somewhat unusually, the grinding actually occurs - and is used - in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleGame">Puzzle Game</a> component, not any of the RPG mechanics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> encourages you to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">Pacifist Run</a> (which is necessarily also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelRun">Low-Level Run</a>) by having the tagline "The friendly RPG where nobody has to die" and a few characters in the first area explaining how to placate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a> peacefully. If you instead decide to do exactly the opposite of that, and level grind in every area until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">there just aren't any monsters left</a>, you get an entire alternate story as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings">EarthBound Beginnings</a></em> is hit pretty badly with this; because the game was never tested for balancing purposes, it suffers from an annoyingly steep difficulty curve that forces the player to grind experience each time the plot advances to a new area. This is particularly necessary when Lloyd and Ana join the party at level 1: those characters will need to gain some levels just to have a chance of surviving areas that are unlocked at about the same time.
</li><li> While it's for the most part unnecessary in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>, the game gives several good opportunities:
<ul><li> After defeating a sanctuary guardian, <em>all</em> the enemies in the area flee from you regardless of your level compared to theirs. Engaging an enemy from behind (practically a given since they're running away) either guarantees an extra attack or an outright free kill, and since the enemies are still giving decent amounts of experience it's a golden opportunity to gain a couple levels.
</li><li> Foppys and Fobbys, which attack in large groups, are weak, respawn readily, and give sizeable experience and money rewards and often a rather useful Psy Caramel upon defeat, were put into the game <em>intentionally</em> for this purpose to bolster your level before facing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss">Master Belch</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Electro Spectre</a>, respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve">Parasite Eve</a></em> has a pretty average leveling curve as you progress in the story, but the amount of EXP required to level up gets insanely high by the late 20s to early 30s. However, due to either a quirk in the programming or intentionally made this way, the amount of EXP needed to level up is <em>much</em> lower once you are past level 38. This makes reaching the cap far easier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarNova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarNova">Phantasy Star Nova</a></em>: For the most part you don't need to grind to complete the story. However, there are two exceptions: With four classes and the ability to switch at will, any class you want to level beyond the first (for cross class skills) is basically a grind. Additionally, patches have added new content to the game - new content that starts at level 110. You will have to grind to level 110.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Deep Dungeon</a> and several other maps featured tiles that, when stepped on, would level your character <strong>down</strong>. These could be exploited by raising a character up with a stat-boosting job, then leveling the character down in a job with very weak stats (so the gain would overpower the loss), and then REleveling him up with another job to work on new stats. Many game-breaking tricks were possible to gain JP/XP... for example one could put an enemy to sleep and also speed break them repeatedly, which combined to give the player hundreds of free turns for every turn the opponent got. During each of these free turns you could steal from them, gaining party-wide JP and gold simultaneously.

On top of this, the Random Dungeons most leveling up takes place in usually work towards the development of your characters and/or their equipment. It's two! Two! Two grinds for the price of one! It's very to exploit the system in general, and considering the story of the series, it makes sense that the point of the series was never to play fair to begin with.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series especially falls into this category, being custom-made for Grinders. Levels top off at 9999 (excluding transmigrations), and <em>while</em> you're grinding, you're also turning your weapons into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Swords</a> in the process.
</li><li> Fortunately, it's very easy to be a smartarse and game the system what for. The fact that you can "Fuse" enemies by way of throwing them into their kin and up the rewards for killing the stronger result is practically built for this.
<ul><li> Including transmigrations, the levels go even higher. Apparently the maximum number of stored levels you can get before storing more stops having an effect is <em>185000</em> - and that's not counting the 9999 levels you can make a character gain normally.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em> has what may be the easiest level grind in existence. Goes like this: There's an easy way to get a character that can easily "steal" objects that are much higher level early in the game. Use it to get high-level items and fuse them together. Use that item to power level the character, then have it get even higher-level items. Before long, all you have to do to level any character up is to hand it your hand-made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> and watch the levels add up. (However, every new character starts with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">level cap</a> of 100...but this can be easily raised to the 9,999 maximum with a few fusions.)
</li></ul></li><li> Made ridiculously easy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc">Luminous Arc</a></em>, where healing or buffing any ally earns the character casting the spell 30 experience, and it takes 100 exp to level. This doesn't sound so special until you realise that upon gaining a level, your [HP] and [MP] are reset to full, allowing you to simply go to a low-level map with all your healers and buffers and boost them up by massive amounts.
</li><li> The Tower of Valni in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em> is, in-story, the place where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Sacred Stone of Frelia was kept, until the Grado Empire raided the tower and broke it.</span> In game, as it's full of low-level monsters, it can be used as this. There are also random monster skirmishes which can easily be used for grinding, particularly ones that spawn on earlier-game maps.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> also included skirmishes on the overworld that are meant for level grinding. Additionally, while it didn't include a specific area like the Tower of Valni, it <em>did</em> have an entire DLC map dedicated to EXP farming.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em> continued the trend of including means to level grind, though with a slight twist. The overworld skirmishes can only be done on <em>Birthright</em> and <em>Revelation</em>, but not <em>Conquest</em>; additionally, in <em>Conquest</em>, all DLC levels except the one specifically meant for level grinding do not provide EXP to the characters.

The experience gained decrease the higher the difference in level, but there's always using skills and items on yourself, known as "Apple Throwing".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics">Telepath Tactics</a></em> tends to discourage this; while you gain experience with every action rather than with every kill, most experience-granting actions are offensive and thus consume limited resources. There are some abilities that can be used indefinitely, though, allowing a patient player to level grind as much as they like in the right circumstances. Shove and Pull are particular favorites, as they cost nothing and inflict no damage, but do give experience (quite a lot in Pull's case). If you corner the last enemy (or weaken them to the point that they're too terrified of counterattacks to do anything), you can use them indefinitely to get as much experience as you want. Steamthopters' cheap Hover ability is even better, as it doesn't end the character's turn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars: Dual Strike</a></em> introduced the skills mechanic where, for every 1000 points earned by a CO, they "ranked up" and unlocked an empty skill slot and their choice of skill to put there. The early skills are near worthless, such as getting a miniscule 5% raise to attack power, but the later skills you earn are devastating, such as the ability to deploy units from <em>any allied city</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4cnip');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4cnip" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4cnip');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(although some, such as this one, can only be gained by beating the campaign mode, making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">not entirely straight</a> case of promoting grinding)</span>. Since points won in the non-canon War Room counted, a patient-enough player could farm Jake to Rank 10 before even starting the campaign and blast through story mode effortlessly. It was such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> the mechanic was removed entirely from <em>Days of Ruin</em>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, experience gained by killing mobs gives experience levels. Although these are pointless for the first part of the game, once the player obtains diamonds they can make Enchantment Tables. These allow weapons, armor, and tools to be enchanted with special abilities, such as reduced damage from use, extra damage when attacking monsters, protection from certain types of damage (explosions, fire, water, fall, etc.), and increased item drops. The problem is that experience gained from monsters is worth much less at higher levels, and dying makes the player lose almost all their experience. As a result, even with structures built specifically to spawn and damage mobs automatically, it can take days to get enough experience for the best enchantments. Made worse by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> deciding what enchantments are received, which can absorb large amounts of exp only to give a common, less useful enchantment or even <em>ignore up to one quarter of the experience</em> (but still take it) when calculating which enchantment will be given.
<ul><li> This has been rectified by later updates, as now far more activities (such as farming, mining, smelting ores, cooking food, and fishing) all reward the player with experience, and books can now be enchanted, and anvils can be used to fix items without the loss of the enchantments, and merge enchantments. In addition, villagers now sell experience bottles, and books with enchantments can be found in dungeons. Of course getting some of the enchantments is still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> but at least you can avoid spending 30 levels on a diamond pickaxe only to get Unbreaking I.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGam3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGam3">The Gam3</a></em>: A large part of Alan's time is spent doing repetitive or unusual activities with the explicit purpose of gaining experience or abilities. He isn't treated as unusual in this regard, as nearly every player shown is desperately trying to become as powerful as they can.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EverybodyLovesLargeChests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EverybodyLovesLargeChests">Everybody Loves Large Chests</a>,</em> being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse">RPG-Mechanics Verse</a>, has quite a bit of this going on, codified and quantified on a per-person basis. Anyone can see the precise level of their power by simply chanting, <em>"Status,"</em> and there's an <em>entire industry</em> of Scribes with Appraisal skills useful for identifying other people in this manner. Most of it's logical enough: practice with a sword, you get better at swordfighting. Practice casting Ruin magic, you become a more proficient Warlock.
<ul><li> However, an individual can also advance in power and proficiency by just <em>understanding</em> their craft better through rigorous thought and theory. On several occasions, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster">main character</a> makes major breakthroughs in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting">shapeshifting</a> ranks not by practicing what it already knows, but by experimenting with and inventing new techniques that it never had tried before, such as growing and controlling many spidery limbs for locomotion, or learning to mimic the structure of an axle and wagon wheel in a way that doesn't result in the structure separating from its body and therefore becoming inert.
</li><li> Additionally, in times of war the government <em>sponsors</em> level grinding to raise the stats of its soldiers, by sending high-leveled individuals to weaken high-level monsters, and then having a low-level adventurer finish it off for lots of experience. However, while this is an effective way to get their Levels high, soldiers raised in this way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompletelyTrained" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompletelyTrained">tend to have their Skills go completely neglected</a> outside of basic training, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkilledButNaive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkilledButNaive">and they lack the wit and experience</a> that a similarly leveled individual would have learned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">earning those levels the hard way.</a>
