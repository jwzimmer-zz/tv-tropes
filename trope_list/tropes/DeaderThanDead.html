</p><p>There's only one solution when death is not enough. It's time to kill that guy so thoroughly, he becomes Deader Than Dead.
</p><p>The actual implementation of Deader Than Dead varies. Sometimes it requires killing more than one component of the target, often its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">soul</a> and its body at the same time.

And sometimes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">a particularly nasty alternative to death</a> has to be found.

On the other hand, if it's a story where resurrection requires a (mostly) intact body, it's simply a matter of making sure the body isn't intact.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Naraku had his body obliterated multiple times, but always regenerated before the end of the episode. Actually, for a big part of the series, killing him would have required killing his heart, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">stored in another being</a> (he eventually just absorbs the other being because it tries to betray him). In the end, Naraku ended up Deader Than Dead when Kagome used the Shikon Jewel to <em>wish Naraku's spirit out of existence</em> along with the Shikon Jewel itself.
</li><li> Kikyo was killed multiple times. The first time, she actually died but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">came back</a>. The second time, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">fell off a cliff</a>. Then she fell into a valley full of caustic poison. At a point in the story, she finally died forever when she <em>dissolved in front of everyone</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Sticking with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a>, in the world of the <em>Mermaid</em> series (<em>Mermaid Forest</em>, <em>Mermaid's Scar</em>, etc.). Anyone who survives eating a mermaid's flesh can basically only die if something happens to the head, a la <em>Highlander</em>. Decapitation is mentioned, while one immortal succumbs to total consumption in an intense fire.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NinjaScroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NinjaScroll">Ninja Scroll</a></em> movie features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who can regenerate any part of his body  even decapitation won't stop him. Jubei therefore has to get creative when defeating him; he eventually does so by covering the villain's body in a thick layer of molten gold and letting the cooled statue sink  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">with his still-living body encased inside, presumably forever</a>  to the bottom of the ocean.

While souls are chained to bodies after death, the bonds weaken over time, creating spirits. However, the moment a spirit is made manifest, resurrection becomes totally impossible as there's no longer any connection between soul and body. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Falin was barely hours or days away from becoming a spirit  Marcille's envisioning of the bonds keeping her soul tethered to her skeleton is that only one decrepit bond remains, necessitating the elf's use of forbidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a>.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a> is loaded with characters who cheat death in a variety of ways (being undead, reincarnating, etc...). The two Shikis, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai">Shiki Ryougi</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Shiki Tohno</a>, can kill these things deader, because the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception that they bear allow them to destroy their very <em>concept</em> of being. In fact, they can even kill things like ghosts, buildings, telekinesis, or <em>appendicitis</em> using a butter knife. To be specific, they can kill anything they can comprehend the death of. Ryougi has Akasha helping her comprehend the death of some things, so she can kill anything that she can perceive as 'living'; Tohno, meanwhile, doesn't have this assistance (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">and thus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">is slowly being driven mad</a>). In one of his endings, he kills Arcueid's connection with Gaia so that he stands a better chance of beating her while the moon is out. In another route, he is able to actually kill poison while <em>it's still flowing through the bloodstream.</em>

<ul><li> The series which cheapened death to the point where the main cast isn't all that concerned when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> starts killing off the majority of the planet's population, since they can just be wished back to life! There are exceptions to this:
<ul><li> People who die of natural causes can't be wished back by Shenron, which is why Goku developing a heart condition during the beginning of the Android Saga was such a big deal.
</li><li> Earth's original Dragon Balls, created by Kami, had the rule that you could only have a given wish granted once, so anyone who died a second time would be dead for good. Namekian Dragon Balls threw this limitation out the window, and had no such limitation on the number of times one could be brought back. When Dende became the new Kami, he removed the limitation on Earth's Dragon Balls as well.

When Vegeta goes to stall Kid Buu, Goku warns him that this is a risk.
</li><li> Super Buu only existed as a combination of Fat Buu and Kid Buu. Since Kid Buu has been reincarnated as Uub, this can never happen again, and Super Buu can't even be revived with the Dragon Balls, as he never had a soul of his own.

<ul><li> Zen'O is stated to have the ability to "erase" anything he wants. This is treated as much more severe than death, since it wipes out the soul along with the body, and is further implied to be irreversible. This happens to <em>everyone</em> in Future Trunks's home timeline barring Future Trunks himself, Future Mai, and Future Zen'O; not only are they dead, but they've also had their souls and afterlife completely wiped out due to Future Zen'O erasing everything in existence within the timeline in order to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Merged Zamasu's non-corporeal form</a> from infecting everything and eventually spreading into other timelines.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Beerus (and presumably all Gods of Destruction) has a similar ability to "destroy" whatever he wishes using a form of Ki unique to them known as Hakai/Destruction Energy. While not as powerful as Zen'O's version, it has similar effects. He has demonstrated that he can destroy both the dead and other gods. They just... go away, usually screaming. Despite having the Dragon Balls, the show treats it as deadly serious and there seems to be no coming back from destruction.
</li><li> ...until the end of the Universe Survival arc, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all the universes erased by Zen'O were resurrected using the Super Dragon Balls</span>.

<ul><li> Hollows and shinigami are post-death beings. In short, ghosts. Although it's possible to kill them without actually cutting off their heads, they can potentially survive truly severe injuries. As a result, the only way to be absolutely certain Hollow or Shinigami is dead is decapitation. This can lead to extraordinary measures being taken to ensure the most powerful Hollows or Shinigami are definitely dead from their wounds and stay that way. Even then, being a Buddhism-influenced story, this will free the souls to continue along the wheel of transmigration, allowing the soul to be reborn as a completely new being.
</li><li> Quincies take this one step further than anyone. They don't simply kill Hollows, they destroy the soul as well. They are the only beings that are capable of eradicating a soul from existence itself, meaning the soul cannot go on to be reborn into future lives.
</li><li> The anime-only Bounts can eat both unsent and living souls. In fact, it has been noted that a Shinigami's zanpakuto is the ONLY thing that can help souls move on (not counting the natural transformation of unsent souls into Hollows).

In the anime, a Homunculus must be killed once per incomplete philosopher's stone within them (or forced to expel them otherwise, and then die again), but are frozen in place (allowing all the time in the world to actually do this) when confronted with a piece of their original human body.

<ul><li> Orochimaru: The Naruto poster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasOnceAMan">thing</a> for defying death. He survived a close brush with the Shinigami, Tsunade's rock-shattering punches, and being sliced apart by an electric katana.

So long as one of those still exists, he can potentially gain a new host body. Despite everything that happens to him, he is still alive at the end of the manga.
</li><li> Kakuzu: He has five hearts, all torn out of other shinobi. To kill him you have to destroy <em>all</em> of them before he tears yours out and adds it to the collection. It took a jutsu capable of destroying his body on a cellular level to put him down. <em>That</em> didn't kill him. He was still down on one (possibly faulty) heart. Kakashi eventually finished him off.
</li><li> Hidan: Cut off his head and he complains about his hair getting pulled. He had to be dismembered, buried in an isolated forest, and left for a few years until his immortality jutsu ran out. And he still has time to roll his head back into action. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that he is currently dying slowly of dehydration... and his head will rot before he eventually dies.
</li><li> Hokages 1-4: All currently in the stomach of the God of Death, though it turns out the Uzumaki Clan had a counter for this as well.
</li><li> Obito survived half of his body being crushed by a boulder as a child. As an adult he went on to survive a wide range of overkill attacks aimed at ending him and was even revived after being forced to use a jutsu that killed him. He finally died when Kaguya reduced his still-living body to ash, but that didn't keep him from giving Kakashi temporary use of the Sharingan from beyond the grave.

</li><li> Digimon killed in the physical world cannot be reborn as Digieggs as their data is locked out of the digiworld where they would need to go to do so. However if Wizardmon is any indication they aren't forever lost either, as he lingers around in the area he died as a kind of digital "Ghost"

</li><li> Anyone eaten by Neo falls under this trope. Everything, that Neo eats completely disappears from this world, breaking the law of conservation of energy - in other words, he consumes things without leave behind any energy or matter. This includes soul energy, which means, that even abovementioned spirits, that can constantly reincarnate, permanently die, if Neo eats them. And on top of that, his bites also can't be regenerated, because <em>individual cells admit their defeat and give up</em>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieKnight">The Zombie Knight</a></em>, a servant can always be resurrected by their reaper as long as the reaper survives. Killing the reaper will prevent the servant from coming back, and drive the servant into a mindless rampage until their soul decays too much to sustain them. Failing that, a servant can be kept from resurrection by cutting off their head and freezing it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWardstoneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWardstoneChronicles">The Wardstone Chronicles</a></em> has the creatures of the Dark be soulless and once destroyed, they can never return. One such creature is The Bane who was worshiped as a God, then trapped behind an iron gate, released from the iron gate, brought back to the iron gate (if he returns to the gate, he can never escape again, so already a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>) and to top it all off, the main character impales the poor demon three times with his iron rod before causing the demon to explode and disappear from existence.
</li><li> The <em>Taltos</em> novels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> see people die and come back all the time; "revivification" is a tricky spell but most nobles will be willing to have an emergency fund for just such an occasion. If you want someone to <em>stay</em> dead, cutting off their head or damaging their brain will make reviving them impossible, or you can always stab them with a Morganti weapon, which will eat their soul, not only preventing resurrection but also cutting the victim out of the cycle of afterlife and reincarnation that is the natural order of things in Dragaera. One of the few times where Deader Than Dead <em>really means</em> deader than dead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>, the only way to be sure that the Dark One doesn't reincarnate the Forsaken, his lieutenants, is to kill them with Balefire, which retroactively erases them from the timeline a few minutes backwards. This causes the Dark One to miss the window of opportunity to pull them back into the Pattern (time). In addition, killing a spirit residing in <em>tel'aran'rhiod</em>, the World of Dreams, causes that spirit to be removed from the Pattern altogether.
</li><li> Deliberately subverted (somewhat) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> book series by Diane Duane, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is almost always just a particular avatar of the Lone Power, who is so ubiquitous as to be represented in practically every culture (including alien ones)'s mythology or folklore, usually as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterGod">Trickster God</a> as its "gift" of death/entropy has to be accepted by each species as it gains sentience... though it is also rather blatantly a Lucifer figure too (Wizards greet him as "Fairest and Fallen", and his invention of entropy got him kicked out of the Powers That Be's godly clique). Then again, the same holds true of fellow Power "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">The One's Champion</a>", who is intended to beat the ever-living crap out of it in its own avatar in a number of key battles... over and over and over again.
</li><li> Played straight in a slightly weird way in the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> book, in which an evil (and apparently quite dead) sorcerer's nasty leftover rage manifests as a ghost that wreaks havoc on the folks he blames for his defeat, and anyone close to them.
<ul><li> This is further explored in <em>Ghost Story</em>. Ghosts are spiritual copies of the deceased, formed and powered by their memories. A sufficiently powerful ghost can use memories to augment their abilities or manifest into a physical form. This is essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a>, however, and a ghost who uses up too much of their memories can become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Wraith</a>—a mindless being that feeds on other ghosts' memories- or cease to exist entirely.
</li><li> Also, Kemmler. To elaborate, Heinrich Kemmler was a necromancer of near-divine power and possibly more evil than Satan (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> is was only one of the atrocities he instigated, and implied not to be one of the worst ones). The White Council killed him six times, and confirmed it, boot on body, every time. None of this was more than a minor inconvenience. However, the seventh time stuck, and Heinrich Kemmler is, per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, finally and irrevocably dead.

There <em>are</em> varying degrees of deadness, and once a person gets beyond a certain point, any resurrection of them will be a horrible monstrosity. The Abhorsen's job is to lay the walking dead to rest permanently by sending them beyond the Ninth Gate of Death, from which no one ever returns — even escorting them there personally, if necessary.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Dracula</a></strong>. Every modern appearance of the legendary bloodsucker feels obligated to invent a new way for him to be Deader than Dead by the end of the story, because staking him through the heart, cutting his head off and / or burning his remains <em>just won't cut it</em> to keep the old bastard down. Solutions include a vampire-annihilating megaplague (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeTrinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeTrinity">Blade: Trinity</a></em>), using a stake made from the True Cross (webcomic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ClanOfTheCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ClanOfTheCats">Clan of the Cats</a></em>), being killed by a werewolf (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing">Van Helsing</a></em>), hanging him from a cross at dawn (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula2000">Dracula 2000</a></em>), being absolved by a priest before being killed (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaIIILegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DraculaIIILegacy">Dracula III: Legacy</a></em>) ...and having his castle sealed inside an eclipse and his soul reincarnated into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Japanese schoolboy</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a></em> onward...), or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">being turned into imaginary numbers</a>.

But if you make it <em>really</em> hard to kill you and make them truly hate you, then once they do get you they're going to be <em>creative</em> about making sure you don't return...

Oh, and her soul is destroyed in the process, though it seems as if some part of her has imprinted on the demon, giving it at least one of her personality quirks in that she is fond of Wesley.
<ul><li> The demon had appropriated her body, and the subject of mind/body dualism is beyond the scope of this entry, but memories and emotions are all stored in the brain, which is part of the body. Sometimes Illyria deliberately accessed Fred's memories.
</li><li> The episode following Fred's death beats the viewer over the head repeatedly about exactly how dead Fred is. It seems every other minute, the viewer had to be reminded that Fred was very incredibly dead: Her organs were boiled and burned up inside her body to feed Illyria, making it inhospitable for a human soul to reside in, and Fred's soul itself was devoured by Illyria as well.
</li><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan">plan</a>, had the show gotten a new season, was to split up Fred and Illyria. In other words, it would turn out that Fred's soul was NOT destroyed after all.

How exactly this works is never fully explained. It is hinted at that <em>all</em> Cylons get resurrected, including the semi-biological self-piloting Raiders, not merely the twelve fully biological human models. (Although it is unclear if this is also the case for the completely robotic Centurions). For the process to work, a resurrection ship or resurrection facility has to be in range, so if a Cylon dies in space beyond range, he or she is permanently dead, their individual memories and consciousness lost to the collective. In addition, the Cylons deal with rebellious members by "boxing" them, where they download their consciousness into a small metal box and then put the box in storage. Also, season 4 sees the beginning of a Cylon civil war, one of the first acts of which is the luring of several ships into an ambush and destroying them while out of range of the Resurrection Ship. This is presented as a particularly heinous crime to the Cylons, who understandably have something of a blasé attitude toward death.

It's eventually established that nothing will make Jack Deader Than Dead unless he is in fact the Face of Boe, in which case he'll finally die for good in a few billion years. Maybe.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation">Book of Revelation</a></em>, everyone will be resurrected at the end of the Millennium, to stand judgment. The damned, though, will then be thrown into the Lake of Fire, of which an angel has already told the visionary, "This means destruction." No more resurrections.

<ul><li> In the earlier days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a>, removing monsters from play (called banishing now) had this effect. Nowadays, the game has some cards which can even return removed monsters, and there is even a deck theme (Different Dimension) that thrives on doing so. It still counts, though—it's generally more problematic to summon a banished monster than a monster in the Graveyard.
<ul><li> A number of cards can be used to banish a card facedown, which is more or less this - it's been ruled that, since it's facedown, that means it can't be identified by other cards, so any attempt to bring back a specific card that's been banished facedown won't work. Only cards that return <em>all</em> banished cards, notably Necroface and Elemental HERO Electrum, can bring those back. This is tricky to use against the opponent, though, as most cards with this effect are based on banishing your own cards as a cost.
</li></ul></li><li> Also common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, where resurrection is pricey but doable. There are several ways to make it impossible, though.
<ul><li> Spells which destroy the body completely, i.e. Disintegrate, remove the chance for a simple Resurrection spell.
</li><li> Liches should be mentioned specifically. Not destroying their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">phylactery</a> just causes their body to reform.
<ul><li> A lich can also become a demilich, which can rip out people's souls at will. And digest them. After 24 hours, they're gone for good.
</li><li> At least in 2nd and 3rd edition, it was frequently mentioned that one of the components for the ritual of lichdom a wizard had to make was a potion of extreme deadliness. So deadly that, if the wizard fails in his bid for lichdom, he would die, and the gods would not be able to resurrect the fool if they wanted to.
</li></ul></li><li> There is also a one-of-a-kind monster known as the Tarrasque. The writers probably put it in there to serve as walking Armageddon. It regenerates with lightning speed, most spells simply bounce off its hide, death effects won't work on it, and if you batter it to death, it'll come back in a few days unless you also used a <em>wish/miracle</em> (level 9, most powerful non-epic spells in the game) to make it stay dead. The books further note that even this doesn't finally kill the Tarrasque, but pushes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> on its cycle of sleep-wake-rampage-sleep. This being <em>D&amp;D</em>, however, enterprising players can turn it permanently into something small, then put it in a <em>secret chest</em> spell for long enough so that it is erased from existence, etc. etc.
<ul><li> <em>Unname</em>, a spell which destroys the target's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName">true name</a>, altering reality so that the creature <em>cannot</em> exist.
</li><li> There is another version of that spell that requires you a feat to take "Mother cyst." It kills the person and then destroys their soul, removing them from existence forever. Although it may seem less useful since the target has to be first hit by a level 2 spell, it can be used in campaigns that are not using the "True Name" system. That means it's just as legit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> as it is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> 4th Edition's Tarrasque <em>cannot</em> be killed. It's so powerfully linked to the world that if you actually manage to bring him down to 0 HP, then he simply sinks back into the planet's core and sleeps again. The only way to really kill it is to somehow lure it into another plane or otherwise away from the world before killing it, and that's just a theory.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EpicLevelHandbook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EpicLevelHandbook">Epic Level Handbook</a></em>, there is a special assassin guild called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Garrote</a>. You contact assassins if you want a person to die, you hire the Garrote if you want a person to <em>stay</em> dead. (Specifically, they destroy their victims' bodies beyond resurrection, and in cases that require a 100% certainty, they bring the bodies to the head of the organization so that she can remove them from the multiverse altogether. Naturally, the amount they charge for this is astronomical.)
</li><li> Starting in First Edition AD&amp;D, the <em>Sphere of Annihilation</em> will utterly destroy any being it comes in contact with, and presumably that being's <em>soul.</em> ("No spell can bring the dead character back to life, not even a <em>wish</em>!")
</li><li> The chapters of the D&amp;D rulebook <em>Manual Of The Planes</em> that are about the afterlife describe what immunities the souls of the dead have, implying that they can be slain in combat by those who visit the afterlife.
<ul><li> In the 2nd Ed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a> (set partially in the afterlife after all) rules the souls of the dead could be encountered, and killed. In many cases these souls were permanently dead. Natives of the afterlife killed outside of their native plane would reform on their plane, but if killed on their native plane were permanently dead.
</li></ul></li><li> In Planescape Sigil, if you piss off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFrom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFrom">The Lady Of Pain</a>, the city's enigmatic ruler, she'll send her shadow over you. This causes you to be cut to pieces by hundreds of invisible blades, automatically killing you with no chance of resurrection by any means. Even <em>gods</em> have been killed in this manner. When she decides to pen a berk's name into the dead book, she makes sure it sticks.
</li><li> The Leviathan, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> mentioned in the <em>Elder Evils</em> supplement, has an ability called True Death which destroys the soul of anyone who dies within a hundred miles of one of its aspects. Fortunately, it only has this ability if its Sign is at Overwhelming intensity. (Which as far as Elder Evils go in a campaign using one, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> against it is about to begin.) The True Death ability is available for DMs who want to create their own Elder Evils, but Leviathan is the only example presented in the book who has it.
</li><li> There's no shortage of monsters that eat souls (and monsters that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">corrupt their victims so thoroughly their original selves are essentially dead</a>, monsters that, while leaving souls intact, convert corpses to a difficult-to-resurrect form like ashes or goop, and at least one form of undead that uses captured souls to power its special abilities.)
</li><li> 5e's ''Tomb of Annihilation' campaign features the Death Curse, a global phenomenon that both prevents people from being resurrected after they've died, and causes people who have previously been resurrected to slowly wither away to nothingness. The cause is the pet project of Arch Lich Acererak, who had constructed an artifact known as the 'Soul Monger', which absorbs the souls of all who die in the world, in order to feed it to his newest acquisition, an Atropal. Whether any given soul is devoured by the Atropal before the artifact is destroyed is determined at random, but once it's been devoured, there's no way to return from that.
</li><li> Promotional material for <em>Expedition to Castle Ravenloft</em>, a 3E updating of D&amp;D's most infamous and hard-to-eliminate vampire, urged players who dared to tackle Strahd von Zarovich: "This time, make sure he's <em>dead</em> dead!"
</li><li> When you are doing favors for gods, especially evil ones, often if a character dies, his or her soul will belong to said god. Resurrection would be impossible. Unless you killed the god.
<ul><li> Which requires you to go to their plane and kill them. Without critical hits. Or ongoing damage. Or instant death attacks. Must I go on?
</li></ul></li><li> A natural death by old age cannot be undone by any means.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> gives one sole way back after a death from old age - Reincarnation. This allows a way back after being slain by such creatures as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemiDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemiDivine">the kami</a> or certain dragons, which have the ability to artificially age creatures. After the one week grace period passes, however, no mortal magic can bring a soul back.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> version of this is the final power of one of the monk archetypes from <em>Pathfinder</em>. A "Monk of the Healing Hand" can activate all his <em>ki</em> and perform a True Resurrection spell on all allies within 50 feet. His body and stuff is then utterly destroyed. He cannot be resurrected by any means, including the power of a god. In addition, his name can't be spoken or written down again and all instances of his written name are erased.
</li><li> In the 4th ed. "Demonicon," it's said that, when a demon lord dies in the Abyss, and the Abyss is tired of playing with said ex-demon lord, a tomb materializes in the layer known as the "Blood Rift." The tomb is inevitably filled with the deceased's favorite possessions, both treasure and servants.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheResurrection">Mummy: The Resurrection</a></em> had the character playing (oddly enough) mummies, immortals who could die any number of times and come back to life, even if their bodies have been burnt to ash or pounded to dust (though it's really hard to do, then). Even their souls were similarly tough, being able to survive Oblivion. As such, the game lists (it's a short list) ways you can <em>really</em> get killed: suicide (not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, actual "I don't wanna live" suicide), losing all permanent Willpower (see suicide), or extremely powerful magic separating the body and soul (like being eaten by Ammit). The only non-magical means of killing a mummy permanently is a point-blank atomic explosion (mummies can come back from dust or ash, but not subatomic particles), and that just traps them in the underworld.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen">Demon: The Fallen</a></em>, killing a demon's body won't kill the demon itself. It <em>will</em> carve out a significant chunk of the demon's power and lash it with Torment, but the demon itself survives—though they go back to Hell if they can't find a new body or host quickly. However, if they die too often, they dissipate into nothingness... and while they're out of their host, any other demon can devour them, destroying them for good and taking a portion of the devoured demon's power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion">Wraith: The Oblivion</a></em> features another fun variant — soulforging. When the rulers of a Necropolis need to get rid of a Spectre (or a political dissident... or just need some building materials), they'll take the guy and run their corpus under a spectral flame until it's melted, then forge the run-off into soulsteel. It's even implied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">that something of the damned's consciousness survives, but not enough to fight back</a>. The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue">Samuel Haight</a> wound up as an ashtray when the fandom got sick of him.
</li><li> Two special cases in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">vampires</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Prometheans</a>. Inflicting what would be mortal damage to a vampire merely sends it into a deathlike sleep called torpor, from which they eventually awaken... unless fire, sunlight, or extreme mutilation (think decapitation or woodchipper) is used to finish the job, in which case they're the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a>. Prometheans, meanwhile, all come with one built-in resurrection (which burns all but one dot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel">Azoth</a>), and can learn a power <em>called</em> Revivification (Osirans innately start with it) that sacrifices itself to bring them back; while they have it, they may give up dots of Azoth to pull slain Prometheans back as well. Even these aren't foolproof, though—fire does to them as it does to vampires (those powers need corpses to work on), they don't get the one-shot resurrection if they only have one dot of Azoth, and certain Pandoran abilities (including one that involves eating them alive) will do the trick permanently. Furthermore, Prometheans don't have souls (most of them spend their existences <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBecomeHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBecomeHuman">trying to earn one</a>), so if they die permanently, it's lights out.
<ul><li> Amongst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">mages</a>, on the <em>very</em> rare occasions it's deemed necessary to render someone Deader than Dead, they do so by removing that person's soul, traveling to the end of the Dreamtime, and <em>throwing it away in the primordial ocean at the end of reality.</em> This is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">the most abhorrent thing possible for a mage to do</a> (for obvious reasons), and if it is ever invoked, the local ruling council will <em>always</em> voluntarily resign as an indication of their ultimate failure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters">Book of the Dead</a></em>, being the NWOD sourcebook for the Underworld, introduces two ways to render something Deader than Dead. On the one hand, there's the Crushers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownInTheDumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownInTheDumps">The Junkyard,</a> which are explicitly capable of killing anything. On the other hand, there's the Grave Dream, a repository of dead dreams which can be dreamed into in addition to the usual route of navigating the Underworld, where <em>the very first Old Law listed</em> is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Dead In, Dead Out.</a>" That said, it also introduces a way to <em>defy</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a>: Polygdemon aka Mictlantecuhtli, the Kerberos of Mictlan. It's not easy, but if you can entreat his favor, he can summon the soul of anyone who has ever died. True death by moving on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a>, <em>none</em> of this matters to him. Combined with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">Geognosis</a>, relatively erratic behavior and that one of the Laws of his realm is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">"The Words of Polygdemon is Law"</a>, he's very likely one of the mythical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">Deathlords.</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, during the Horus Heresy, when the Emperor of Mankind confronted his traitor son Horus, he struck Horus with so much psychic power that Horus' own soul was annihilated. Normally, on death a human's soul is sent to the Warp (and thus powerful servants of Chaos are forever reborn, being bound to their particular Chaos God) but with the destruction of his soul, there was nothing of Horus left, making it impossible for the Chaos Gods to bring him back.
</li><li> <em>Unhinged</em>, a very definitely not tournament-legal expansion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TAbletopgame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TAbletopgame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, addressed the inflation of such things:
<dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>AWOL</strong>: Remove target attacking creature from the game. Then remove it from the removed-from-game zone and put it into the absolutely-removed-from-the-freaking-game-forever zone.
</div></dd></dl><ul><li> Which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> the fact that it's not at all hard to 'recycle' cards in the graveyard in this game and that even the generally accepted method of rendering something Deader than Dead by removing it from the game isn't 100% foolproof.
<ul><li> A rules change finally addressed this, and created the "Exile" zone to replace the "removed from the game" zone. Cards that allow the player to bring in a card from "outside the game" cannot affect the Exile zone, like they could with the "removed from the game" zone. This has had the effect of making the Exile zone <em>more</em> deader than dead than actually not being in the game at all. Some exiling cards, such as Necropotence, return the card to play later; Flicker does so immediately. (It's still useful; it stops stealing, gets rid of auras and counters, and all sorts of other fun.)
</li></ul></li><li> It doesn't stop there: some spells can make something <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">deader than</a> Deader Than Dead</em>. Those spells exile a card and all cards with the same name from all zones of the game, including library and graveyard. It's less about being dead and more about having its very concept deleted from existence.
</li><li> An earlier expansion set <em>Unglued</em> has an even more powerful meta-version. Since all "dead" cards can (obviously) be re-used in the next game, Unglued contains two cards that require that you <em>tear the card to pieces</em>.
</li><li> On a slightly less dead—but still deader than <em>ordinary</em> dead—level, it's possible to kill creatures that are otherwise immune to ordinary damage, or have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">extraordinary regenerative factor</a>, by debuffing them until their toughness (i.e. maximum health) is zero. If you use a global effect (e.g. "all creatures get -2/-2") to do this, then it's played a bit straighter: reviving the dead creature will just cause it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">die again immediately</a>.
</li><li> Inconsistent plotting in the books made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> have to emphasize that Yawgmoth, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> for most of the game's run, is indeed deader than dead. As he'd become a god and lived for thousands of years, only to be barely defeated during the Apocalypse storyline, and show up later to Karona (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> so that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>), many players to this day assume Yawgmoth <em>will</em> come back.
</li></ul></li><li> The Final Rest spell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a>: Magic</em> is a positive take on this. When cast on the deceased it prevents resurrection but more importantly stops necromancers from abusing it for their purposes. There is also a Perk, generally available only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">The Paladin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">Warrior Monk</a> types, that makes any foe slain by your hand qualify, and another that protects you from any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedRevival">Unwanted Revival</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em>, anyone/anything that dies moves to the Hunting Grounds—essentially a spirit counterpart of the material world. From there, it is possible to eventually reach Heaven or Hell, but even that does not have to be permanent. However, upon "killing" someone in the Hunting Grounds you have two options. They can serve you for seven years (absolute-obedience-no-questions-asked style), or you can devour them. At which point you absorb their essence and they utterly cease to exist.
</li><li> If Ming I, the Queen of the Darkness Pagoda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/FengShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/FengShui">Feng Shui</a></em>, hits you with her dreaded Arm of Darkness and you fail the Death Check that getting hit forces you to make, you are instantly and permanently destroyed — you don't come back as a ghost, no schtick can save you or bring you back, and your spirit can't be contacted from beyond the veil. You are, for all intents and purposes, <em>gone</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Lycee</em> TCG, cards can be removed from game in the same manner as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>.
<ul><li> Also, the Special Ability of <a class="urllink" href="http://lycee-wiki.wikidot.com/type-moon-v3-0">Shiki Tohno<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (yes, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">that</a></em> Shiki) kills something Deader Than Dead and makes it impossible for opponent to call the character he killed this way.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em> is a similar situation to Takeshi Kovacs (see literature), except that backups are more common making it even more difficult to kill someone permanently.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>: while death is permanent (you might be able to become a Deathlord, but you can never be truly <em>alive</em> ever again), virtually anything that goes down the mouth of Oblivion is not coming back out. Characters can survive with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">perfect defences</a>, but as soon as the motes run out, there's nothing left but memories.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em>, each character has a genetic template. Every time someone dies, a new body is grown in a lab and implanted with the memories of all their predecessors. One becomes Deader Than Dead if one's genetic template is erased from the system, which may occur if one commits sufficiently egregious treason or by accident or sabotage. And if the Computer discovers you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineEmpathy">Machine Empathy</a>, erasure of your genetic template is only the <em>last</em> thing it will do to you.
</li><li> More of a game mechanic, but still fits the bill. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> Trading Card Game, Pokémon are usually Knocked Out when their HP reaches zero and they and all cards attached to them are sent to the discard pile. Various attacks, Trainer cards, etc. can take them out of the discard pile. However, during the fourth generation, there was a mechanic called the Lost Zone, which if a card is put in there, then it can't be retrieved from the discard pile since it's not in there, and there are few effects (if any) that allow taking cards out of the Lost Zone.
</li><li> One of the sample game modules for the tabletop game version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy">Fighting Fantasy</a></em> deconstructs this in their description of the final battle against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. They state that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> realised that when black magicians set things up so that they can only be killed in one very specific way, that specific way always seems to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">really easy to do</a> if you know the secret. As a result he simply augmented himself to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">Super Toughness</a> instead.

Baron Valtrith kidnaps her and uses an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> to destroy her soul, forcing a Doom Weapon into her body to posses her corpse.

According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the destruction of Serenity's soul is so absolute that if an alternate universe version of Serenity visited the Dragon Fable world, she'd cease to exist too.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em>, your party members can die. But that's not enough for some enemies, which can leave your party members <strong>ERADICATED</strong>, as in their bodies <em>completely disintegrated</em>. Resurrecting party members in that state is much more difficult, requiring the highest level resurrection spells and/or the most expensive treatments. Either way, you'll learn to fear any enemy that has the ability to do it.

The former is an immortal similar to the Nameless One but without any of the irritating side effects. The latter is the caretaker of Sigil who happens to be more powerful than almost any deity within the confines of the city, and will perceive the Nameless One a rash that has to be removed should the Nameless One overstep his place.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens to several characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Emperor</a> is killed by the heroes and goes to hell, which is apparently part of his plan all along as it turns him into a demonic form who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">defeats Satan</a> and takes over hell. Though he returns from hell, this form is presumably undead. He is destroyed again in the final battle, this time for good.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>, the heroes fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Exdeath midway through the game. Even though everyone else was defeated, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Galuf keeps fighting at 0 HP while Exdeath blasts him with enough damage to kill him many times over</a>.

The rest of the party <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">tries using revival magic and healing items on Galuf</a>, but they don't work, and Galuf dies as a result of the battle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, Sephiroth's human body died five years before the events of the game and his body was dissolved in the lifestream, but his soul fuses with Jenova and is reborn. You then end up killing his reborn body at the planet's core. Then you kill his soul in form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">grotesque mutated angel</a>. THEN Cloud kills Sephiroth's astral form in a one-on-one duel in the Lifestream. No other villain in the series has the honor of being this dead, or at least until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren">Advent Children</a></em>.
</li><li> Several of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, most notably <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Seymour</span> (after the party kills him) and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> party member Auron (from the beginning)</span>, are actually "unsent" — souls that have not passed to the local afterlife, the Farplane. As such, the only way to dispatch them permanently is to have Yuna "send" them; this isn't a harmful or painful process unless the target resists, but a soul <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">generally</a></em> can't come back from the Farplane afterward, and the targets in question are usually rather hostile about the prospect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, a major plot by a certain antagonist involves this. See, in the dying remnants of the world where people have stopped aging AND giving birth to new people, the souls of the dead still exist inside the Chaos currently swallowing up the world. Those souls are still intact because living folks remember them. The reverse is true as well; the living have memories of the dead because those deceased souls are still intact. Thanks to this, all these dead people could be carried into the new world and reborn just like everyone else. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">On Bhunivelze's command, the Order of Salvation seeks to prevent this with the holy clavis, which can destroy each and every one of those dead souls AND people's memories of them, completely negating the cycle. This will prevent the "unclean" from entering the new world and erase the "inconvenient" past.</span>
</li><li> The Ascians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> are immortal beings that can be killed, but doing so is just a minor nuisance to them since they can reform their bodies later. The story does eventually explain how this happens and what it takes to actually kill them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When a person dies, their aether gets assimilated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream">The Lifestream</a> and is eventually used to make a new person when they are born. When an Ascian "dies", their soul hangs between the planes of life and death so they can avoid the lifestream until they gain a new body in the corneal realm. To actually kill an Ascian for good, one has to trap their souls in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a> and then use an excessive amount of aether on it to obliterate the soul inside. Much later on in the story, another method was discovered when the primal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">King Thordan absorbed Lahabrea's soul</a>, which effectively killed him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>, the Shun Goku Satsu or Raging Demon technique is said to obliterate the victim's very soul, killing them in the process.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Iji">Iji</a></em>, former Tasen leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Hel Sarie</a> was <em>completely disintegrated</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">along with her whole spaceship</a>, when the latter was hit by a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Komato</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Phantom Hammer</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> If you let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">General Tor</a> (who wields a Phantom Hammer) charge his weapon three times during the final fight against him and fail to dodge, it <em>will</em> happen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Iji</a> as well, not only destroying her body but her <em>stats</em> as well.</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth">Myth</a></em> games, the villains often meet such an end. Balor, the first game's villain is beheaded, then the head is thrown to a magically created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">bottomless pit</a> called The Great Devoid. The fact this was necessary to kill him fully is evidenced by his severed head talking to you during the trip. In Myth II, the villain Soulblighter killed by being cast into lava.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII">Suikoden II</a></em>, a vampire called the Neclord comes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>. In response, about five different powerful beings map out every single contingency and possibility of escape so that this time, when they kill him, it doesn't happen again.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike">Roguelike</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMajEyal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMajEyal">TOME: Tales of Middle-Earth</a></em>, after you kill Tolkien's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> Morgoth, you have the option of entering the Void and killing his soul to prevent a Ragnarok-style war in the future. While traversing the Void, you might have to randomly fight any boss character that you've killed before.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series, after being killed and resurrected as many times as Zero, Sigma is considered gone for good in the final game <em>X8</em>. Because his decimation took place on the Moon's surface, where the Maverick virus isn't as potent, Sigma is denied his ability to regenerate again. Though the game does provide a possible means for Sigma to return, this trope finally takes full effect on Sigma in the time between the X and Zero series in which a special cure program finally wipes out every last trace of the Sigma Virus.
</li><li> All the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimFandango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimFandango">Grim Fandango</a></em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadToBeginWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadToBeginWith">Dead to Begin With</a>, but there are apparently several ways to suffer "death within death", like being crushed, or shot with a sproutella gun (which causes the body to be replaced by a forest of quickly-growing flowers—marigolds, to be specific, as a reference to the Day of the Dead).
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, however, says that "sprouted" souls get reincarnated, which is a punishment for them since it means they have to live another life before eternal rest.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> spoofs this kind of public domain death with the boss monster Ed the Undying. Killing him for the seventh and final time merely results in his crumpled form growling angrily at you while you nonchalantly sweep him up in a dust-pan and leave him leaning on the side of the tomb, too exhausted to try and figure out a way to permanently do away with him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em> has an amulet of life saving that allows the player to survive a deadly incident... as long as said incident doesn't involve being hit with a mind flayer's brain-sucking attack or genociding oneself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlashEmExtended" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlashEmExtended">Slash'EM Extended</a></em>, a <em>NetHack</em> fork, extends the self-genocide death to the added Ungenomold race. If an Ungenomold player ever runs out of hit points, they die without a chance to survive. On the other hand, being hit by a death ray can be survived with an amulet of life saving.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em>, Marona can kill the souls of her Phantoms if they "die" and she herself attacks their... um... phantom corpse. She can still put the pieces back together though, and transmigrate them into a stronger form. She can also do this after the Bonus Boss Baal, after he attempts to possess the Possessed One, and discovers that this just puts him completely under her power. If Marona Soul-Kills him and then examines his "remains" the game states that the area is finally peaceful and calm. Given that in other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponIchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponIchi">Nippon Ichi</a> games, Baal is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> capable of coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> instantly, Marona really accomplishes something by permanently destroying one part. Although Baal does have more than one body.
</li><li> In the computer RPG series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em>, the protagonist (and party members) can easily and frequently be resurrected as necessary. There are a few points in the plot where it is possible for a character to be permanently slain—if taken prisoner by Blackthorne in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaV">Ultima V</a></em>, and Dupre during the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a></em>. The much maligned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX">Ultima IX</a></em> undoes the latter.
<ul><li> Dupre's death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a></em> should be clarified, his death involved being turned to ash in a crematorium, and then his soul was used as a bonding agent to reform the chaos serpent in order to bring balance to the cosmos. Deader than dead because his soul was turned into cosmic superglue. (His subsequent existence as a ghost and resurrection in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX">Ultima IX</a></em> left planet-sized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">plot holes</a>, and many of them, which caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">some people</a> to be... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">a little upset</a>.)
</li><li> While resurrection is by no means impossible, it's not as easy as in certain other settings. It's either extremely expensive in a very stingy setting or very costly in terms of power and resources—and it always leaves the newly-raised character near death, at 0 or 1 hitpoints. In Ultima III, resurrection can fail and leave you with a pile of ashes, playing this trope straight; the ashes can be <em>Recalled</em>, which is even costlier and permanently drops the caster's stats if you do it yourself. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaV">Ultima V</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">VI</a></em> follow every death with a loss of experience.
</li></ul></li><li> Classic text adventure game <em>Adventure Land</em> sends the protagonist to a place called "Limbo" when killed, from which egress is quite easy once you figure out how. There are only a handful methods of dying that really don't allow this.
<ul><li> Likewise, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Enchanter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Enchanter">Enchanter</a> Trilogy provides you with spells (or allies) that automatically resurrect you upon death, but there are a few ways around this if you really screw up. Examples include erasing yourself from existence with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeParadox">Time Paradox</a>, having your soul eaten by a demon, and getting stuck in a permanent nightmare so that you aren't technically dead, but you might as well be.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in a dramatic way when a very young (a few dozen days old) Roxas asks Xigbar the classical infant-question, where the hearts belonging to the deceased of the slain Heartless go. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Kingdom Hearts.</a> He then proceeds to ask, where deceased Nobodies go... And is "shocked" (as far as this is possible) to hear that deceased Nobodies go nowhere, won't return, and can't be met again. This severely depresses Roxas, as he's thinking that one of his only two friends, Axel, was recently killed.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, Nobodies that are killed <em>after their Heartless</em> will reunite with their heart and be reborn as a complete person; oblivion only comes to Nobodies who are killed with their Heartless still running around.
<ul><li> This actually happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</a></em>.

</li><li> It's also what happened to Vanitas, sort of. He was actually the dark half of Ven personified by Master Xehanort. At the end, he attacks Ven to forge the X-Blade (you need two hearts of pure light and pure darkness, respectively, to do that). Ven defeats him in the preliminary battle, but Vanitas overpowers him with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Unversed</a> and starts a conflict in the former's heart.

As it turns out he's wrong, and he ends up in another Hellish dimension, where he is attacked and possibly killed by demons. Whether he's really gone <em>then</em> isn't clear, though he never appears again to you.
</li><li> The series generally inverts with the Bhaalspawn, who can be killed permanently in the normal fashion, whereas everyone else can be raised under the AD&amp;D rules... except that Imoen ignores this rule and both Sarevok and the player character manage to claw their way back from Hell, although the latter wasn't properly dead.
</li><li> Yoshimo is inflicted with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas">geas</a> that forces him to serve Irenicus, and after his inevitable death there's no way to bring him back. Dynaheir and Khalid are also killed by Irenicus prior to the start of the game, and Jahiera states for the latter that his body is so tainted by whatever Irenicus did to him that she couldn't bear to bring him back in that state.
</li><li> The Solar states that Amelyssan's soul will be completely erased after her defeat. The final cutscene sees her watching the magical space-floating Throne of Bhaal crashing and exploding on her.

Finally, he complied and just to make damn sure we know he's gone, they dropped a pile of rocks on him.
<ul><li> Another example could possibly be Gilgamesh's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionSword">Ea</a>. Ea's description indicates that it works by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSpinning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSpinning">spinning</a> so fast that it draws in air and compressing air so hard that it creates a <a class="urllink" href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/typemoon/images/8/8e/EA-HA.gif">time and space rift.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
<div class="indent"> <em>"The rift created by Enuma Elish is said to be a look at the "truth" of what existed before the world. Referring to it as hell, the primordial form of the planet before heaven and earth were split, a land filled with lava, gas, scorching heat, and intense cold, Gligamesh states that it is beginning of all legends of lands of the dead. It is the origin of the memory of all organisms before the existence of the planet that is no longer found in the imaginations or spoken memories of people, but rather a genetically inherent and repressed knowledge of a place and time when organic existence had been impossible."</em>
</div></li><li> It is said to have split heaven from earth, and is the only weapon to be designated a anti-world weapon.

However, with the third installment of the series forthcoming, it remains to be seen whether it worked.
<ul><li> The soulstones were primarily prisons for the souls of the Prime Evils, because usually, all killing them does is send them back to the Burning Hells. They were corrupted, however, thanks to Izual the Betrayer, who filled them in on the soulstones and how to corrupt them, and helped the Prime Evils mastermind their own exile into Sanctuary.
<ul><li> And for the record, destroying the soulstones didn't take. You can thank Adria for that, marking each of the souls of each of the defeated so they would be drawn into the Black Soulstone of the third game.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> Diablo himself, along with the other Prime Evils that were reincarnated into the reborn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> Tathamet are slain for good by the heroes who wield power surpassing that of angels and demons. The ending depicts the monster <em>disintegrating</em> into nothingness as it falls.
<ul><li> Even that didn't take. Tyrael says at the end of <em>Reaper of Souls</em>, after the Black Soulstone is used up, that Diablo will reincarnate eventually. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Probably because</a> the series is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBasedFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBasedFranchise">named</a></em> Diablo, after all...
</li></ul></li><li> At the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, Shepard must defeat Saren either in combat or by convincing him that Sovereign has been using him. Either way ends with a bullet in Saren's head. Shepard then sends a party member to shoot him in the head again "to make sure." Sovereign then assumes direct control of Saren's bionics for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> battle. Only after that is Saren well and truly dead.
<ul><li> Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> Shepard comes back from the dead, but s/he can die forever during the suicide mission. Or by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">having sex with Morinth</a>.
<ul><li> Regular deaths in gameplay are also implied to be permanent, and the revival took 2 years and a colossal amount of funding.

The normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> cutscene with Alexander entering the underworld does not happen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig">The Dig</a></em>, a game whose premise involves an alien technology that will bring people back from the dead, it is stated that after several resurrections you aren't able to be brought back anymore, effectively making you deader than dead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, this trope is the <em>entire purpose</em> of the Grey Warden order. Archdemons (corrupted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">"Old Gods"</a> who unite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">darkspawn</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">horde</a>) body jack the nearest darkspawn upon death, reviving almost instantly. Grey Wardens intentionally introduce a modified version of the darkspawn taint into themselves so that when one of <em>them</em> takes the final blow, the Archdemon will attempt to possess its killer rather than a real darkspawn, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">an act that annihilates both the dragon and the Warden's souls.</a> Without this, the only way to end a Blight would be to either kill every darkspawn in existence or kill the remaining Old Gods in their sleep before they can be corrupted, which wouldn't be any easier considering how many darkspawn are in the Deep Roads looking for them.
</li><li> The ancient magister-turned darkspawn Corypheus first appeared in the <em>Legacy</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">DLC</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, where he was released from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison">Tailor-Made Prison</a> by Hawke and subsequently killed. However, thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">body surfing</a> ability, he was able to survive by taking over a nearby Grey Warden. He then returned as the main villain for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, where he attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">ascend to godhood</a> and rule over Thedas. The Inquisitor destroyed his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">false Archdemon</a>, which disrupted Corypheus' ability to take over a new body, and then opened a Fade Rift inside of the would-be god, which consumed him entirely. Just to clear up any confusion, the World of Thedas Volume II lorebook <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">then stressed that Corypheus is permanently dead</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow">Sorrow</a></em> duology of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> franchise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dracula</a> was defeated for good after a coalition of soldiers, religious orders, and the last Belmont killed him and sealed away Castlevania, the power that enabled him to keep reviving. It's possible for his reincarnation to become the new Dark Lord given the right circumstances since the reincarnation retains the powers and connection to Castlevania that Dracula possessed.
</li><li> Done to excess in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>. First, Luke's fonons are separating, meaning that he will die and no amount of life bottles or resurrection artes can bring him back, and then he stays behind after defeating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadBearingBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadBearingBoss">Load-Bearing Boss</a> to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a> and either gets crushed among the rubble or goes up to the fon belt with Lorelei—there are two lights. Yet he shows up alive three years later with no explanation in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a>: happy ending, right? Wrong. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Jade's character development sidequests</a>, something called the Big Bang Effect means that since Asch's fonons entered Luke's body when Asch died, there's no way for even Jade to prevent Asch's mind overwriting Luke's, erasing his personality and leaving Asch with Luke's body and Luke's memories. Even though the game's mythology states that the souls of dead seventh fonists go to the fon belt with their fonons Luke won't even be able to reunite with Tear there: Asch will essentially eat his soul. It's no wonder that many fans of the game ignore that sidequest and say it's Luke based on the body language of people with every reason to think it is Luke—they weren't there for the sidequest and it is Luke's body, after all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em>, the protagonist and almost all of the characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadToBeginWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadToBeginWith">Dead to Begin With</a>; they're in a deadly game that they need to fight through to get a chance to be brought back to life. Failure means they get "Erased."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon">Fallen London</a></em> the dead can usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">come back to life</a>; this both applies to you and is referenced in-story. There are ways to bring permanent death, though: destroying (decapitating etc.) the victim's body (and even then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Feducci</span> has been known to come back from being reduced to mincemeat), or the "Cantigaster venom." Death from disease or old age is also final.
<ul><li> One exception: The dead can (apparently) never return to the surface again. The only opportunity you have to do this <em>deletes your character entirely</em> if taken, for a very meta example of this trope. After suffering extreme enough injuries the ex-dead often end up retiring to the Tomb Colonies to avoid the awkward stares.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SunlessSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SunlessSkies">Sunless Skies</a></em> takes place in the same universe, though people aren't quite as durable up there as they once were in the Neath. However, one particular option you can take when presented with one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentientStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentientStars">the Judgements</a> is to essentially perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">Rage Against the Heavens</a> while the Heavens are standing right there. The game outright warns you this will kill you, probably harder than anyone has <em>ever</em> been killed. Since you are essentially killed by getting outlawed by reality itself right where it's most capable of enforcing this, nothing you are or ever <em>were</em> continues to exist the instant the Judgement in question has turned its gaze to you.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Moves</a> in fighting games tend to lean towards this trope.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> games, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishHim">Fatalities</a>" each character can perform frequently conform to this trope. For example, one of Scorpion's fatalities in Mortal Kombat (also known as "MK 9") involves him slicing his enemy in half, then decapitating them, kicking the apparently lifeless corpse over... then slicing their severed head in half for good measure. However, such actions are also an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a>, since they can be performed after every fight.

<ul><li> Raziel became a Wraith; essentially a parasite that feeds directly on souls. Amusingly enough this <em>completely defies</em> this trope. Even after having his body completely disintegrated he'll find a way to come back, and even when barred from the physical realm by a GOD he manages to possess corpses for a workaround. A major driving force of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a> is everyone else trying to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">immortal</a> warrior to do their dirty work.

Havencraft has the most cards involved with this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>, Dark Templar energies are needed to kill the Zerg Cerebrates for good, since the Overmind would resurrect them otherwise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em>: The rules of resurrection have been retconned repeatedly over the series' lifetime, but as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, the following basic rules apply: Mortals only permanently die if their souls are destroyed (one way to do this is to consume them with Fel energy) or if their bodies are completely annihilated, while elementals and demons can only be destroyed on their home planes; if killed in the mortal world, they simply respawn some time later. It is not clear how these rules apply to the Old Gods, at least one of which has been canonically resurrected. Of major characters:
<ul><li> Ragnaros the Firelord, elemental lord of the Firelands, is defeated in the Molten Core raid of <em>World of Warcraft</em>, but that doesn't kill him for good. In the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion, the Cenarion Circle traps him in the Firelands so that he can be permanently slain.
</li><li> Archimonde, one of the two Eredar commanders of the Burning Legion, is destroyed in <em>Warcraft III</em> at the World Tree, Nordrassil, but later returns. He is killed permanently in <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, after pulling players into the Twisting Nether in desperation.
</li><li> Kil'jaeden, the other Eredar commander of the Legion, is defeated during <em>Burning Crusade</em> as he attempts to enter Azeroth through the Sunwell. He is not killed for good until <em>Legion</em>, when he is confronted by Velen and Illidan on his Nether-traversing ship and brought down over the Legion's homeworld of Argus.
</li><li> In the prologue of <em>Legion</em>, Gul'dan annihilates King Varian Wrynn by exploding him with Fel energy. In a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">karmic symmetry</a>, Illidan explodes Gul'dan in the same way at the end of the Nighthold raid.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenLegends">X-Men Legends</a> II</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Deadpool</a>, who says he wants you "so dead you'd have to be reanimated as a corpse."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizardry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizardry">Wizardry</a> series, particularly in its earlier and most brutal games, could do this to you twice over. Run out of hit points or get hit by death effect, and a character is dead. If an attempt to raise a dead character fails, or they're hit with a very powerful death effect, they're disintegrated to ash. If an attempt to raise a disintegrated character fails, or something truly extraordinary occurs (like teleporting into solid rock) they're "lost" and <em>erased from your disk</em>. Later games were a <em>little</em> less brutal, introducing the "Extinct" status effect. It effectively meant "Deader Than Dead;" a character who was beyond resurrection. You could still look at the character sheet, though.
<ul><li> Additionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardryTaleOfTheForsakenLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardryTaleOfTheForsakenLand">WizardryTaleOfTheForsakenLand</a> added a new way to lose a character permanently. A character who died while possessed by the reaper would lose his soul immediately. While the reaper could be evaded fairly easily, some doors could only be seen let alone entered if a party member was possessed. Valuable and unique loot were hidden behind these doors, making this a very real threat.
</li></ul></li><li> The "best" ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR">NieR</a></em> has our title hero asked to sacrifice himself to save his daughter/sister (depending on your protagonist). But it's not a matter of sacrificing his life—he has to give away his whole existence, and will be forgotten by all. If you agree, the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">erases your save file and never again lets you use the name you gave to the protagonist</a>.
<ul><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a>, at least for YoRHa androids and machine lifeforms. If the former die, the Bunker keeps backups of their data, so at worst they'll suffer varying degrees of memory loss depending on when they last backed themselves up (though some androids are still seen grieving over the deaths of their comrades, as there's no getting back those memories.) The latter are okay as long as their machine core remains intact, and even then if they're still connected to the network it can just build a new body for them. This even extends to the gameplay, as death is a minor inconvenience that dumps you back to the nearest save point and forces to return to your dead body to retrieve your chips. However, machines who <em>aren't</em> connected to the network, such as the residents of Pascal's village, are at risk of true death, which is eventually inflicted on them, and early in Route C/D the Bunker is destroyed and all but a small handful of androids (<em>not</em> including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies">protagonist 2B</a>) are either wiped out or irreparably infected by the Logic Virus and driven to serve the machine network. Dying in-game after this point also causes you to completely lose all progress since your last save. Ending E, however, takes place after Endings C and D, where A2 is dead and 9S is either also dead or left to an ambiguous fate, and revolves around Pod 042 attempting to defy this trope and salvage what's left of 2B, 9S and A2's data to give them one more chance at life. Also played with with Adam and Eve, both of which (either willingly or unwillingly) are disconnected from the network and are killed, but in Ending D they mysteriously show up in the Ark (though those could've just been backed up versions of them.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Loom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Loom">Loom</a></em>, characters can die, but if their soul is still nearby, they can be restored to life by way of the Healing draft. There also exists the draft on Unmaking, which is this trope as it completely annihilates the target in a spray of blood and organs, leaving nothing behind to resurrect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</a></em>, you kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Cackletta only about halfway through the game, but her spirit goes on to possess Bowser, becoming "Bowletta". It isn't until the end of the game that you vanquish her for good.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a> Melee</em> and <em>Brawl</em>, when characters are defeated, they simply revert back into their trophy forms and can be brought back to life with outside help. At the end of Melee's Adventure Mode, Bowser comes back as Giga Bowser this way, but defeating him a second time makes his trophy <em>explode into dust</em>.
</li><li> A rather amusing example takes place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em>. Throughout the course of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">rather long</a> battle against Chykka, the opponent is seemingly defeated in its larval form, but survives by rapidly aging itself into its adult form. <em>Then</em>, when it's defeated in that form, it's revived via Ing possession. When that finally gets taken out, its corpse remains in the area, which is fairly unusual for the series. However, if you scan it, the info basically goes out of its way to assure the player that this trope is in effect;
<div class="indent">"<em>Bioscan complete. Target Chykka has been terminated. Lifesigns are at flatline. No regenerative ability in effect. No evidence of symbiotic corpse possession. Resurrection does not appear likely.</em>"
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darwinia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darwinia">Darwinia</a></em> features a cycle of reincarnation in its digital world, where Darwinians die, their soul ascends to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream">Central Repository</a> to add their accumulated experiences to it, and then return to Darwinia again to be processed into a new Darwinian (or alternatively, their soul is just shoved into an incubator to spawn a new Darwinian on the spot.) Even viruses are a part of this, since they're just infected and mutated Darwinians anyway. The sole exception is if someone is killed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Soul Destroyer</a>, a virus type that Dr. Sepulveda explains has introduced to the Darwinians the concept of true death for the first time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em> has the God-Knight of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Hive</a>, Crota. The Dark Below expansion's campaign culminated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Guardian(s)</a> destroying the giant crystal that housed Crota's soul, in the mission "The Awakening". As it turns out, that didn't actually kill him, it simply sent him back to his personal realm. To kill him for good, you must complete the "Crota's End" Raid, which involved storming his realm, breaking through his defenses and taking him down before he regains enough power to try to take over Earth again. Later, in the Taken King expansion, you had to do the same with Crota's father and the titular Taken King, Oryx, in the story mission "Regicide" and the "King's Fall" Raid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyPlanetRobobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyPlanetRobobot">Kirby: Planet Robobot</a></em> has this happen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> President Haltmann.

By the time you face Star Dream Soul OS's final phase, pausing reveals that they're now completely deleted, effectively erasing him <em>from existence</em>. Once the OS is defeated, any slim hope for his salvation is quashed as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartDrive">Heart Drive</a> crumbles to bits.

Of course, this being a <em>Danganronpa</em> execution, it's more meant as a showy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicDeath">Ironic Death</a> and a way for Monokuma to mock the culprit than an actual deader than dead scenario..

</li><li> In a very strange fashion, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> has canonized the concept of both organic and artifical intelligences having souls of a sort... because certain Warframes (Nekros and Garuda) can <em>rip them out of enemies and weaponize them</em>. The soul/life energy of the victim also visibly explodes once Nekros or Garuda is done with them, just in case you thought those Grineer were going to experience an afterlife.

He's just dead." Max, however, loses his personality and gets transformed into an ordinary molecule, meaning by the established physics, he can't return at all. At least until Tailsteak lets the physics model break down at the end.
</li><li> While characters never really come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan">Dominic Deegan</a>, Oracle For Hire</em> (the key exception being Helixa and a handful of demons/ghosts), several have found themselves Deader than Dead in a fairly simple way—their souls were destroyed. This is not done lightly, however, as when a soul is destroyed it causes a massive explosion. The simultaneous destruction of <em>thousands</em> of souls at the end of the War in Hell rendered the landscape unrecognizable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> exists that can resurrect the dead and rebuild bodies that were burnt to a crisp. However, there's no way to rebuild a completely destroyed brain, and with an intact brain, resurrection just doesn't work sometimes. For this reason, some characters stay dead, and some don't.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures">DMFA</a></em>, after killing Dark Pegasus for the third time, Dan is seen enacting a sealing ritual: "No come back to life! No cookie!" (A much later comic cuts to his grave... and spends three motionless panels indicating that he's still dead.)
<ul><li> He does eventually come back. The very person responsible for it points out the minor flaw in Dan's approach <a class="urllink" href="http://www.missmab.com/Comics/Vol_949.php">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The undead race is made up of sentient zombies, brought back in order to have an unkillable horde, as they can lose limbs, organs, even be decapitated, and still put themselves back together. Unfortunately for their creator, they later ended up with free will and personalities of their own, so he devised a way of killing them off permanently that means magically frying them to ashes. As demonstrated on Hannah in Dan's flashback to his first adventure.
<ul><li> It is also revealed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Demonology 101 pages</a> that the undead can be killed permanently by having their brains destroyed.

<ul><li> Sarda has killed the Light Warriors a dozen times, subsequently bringing them back so he'll be able to torture them some more.
</li><li> However, the trope is played very straight with Black Belt. The author had his head chopped off and spraying blood to get people to shut up about bringing him back. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">there never was a fifth Light Warrior.</a>
</li><li> And then there was the villain whose bones were broken and his skull buried upside-down at a crossroads. "Ideally, this is how we would dispose of all our enemies."
</li></ul></li><li> Deader than Dead is a harder state to attain in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> than in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">game it's based on</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">to the frustration of the main characters when fighting certain villains</a>), but it's been mentioned in two cases. First, as in the game, angels and such die permanently when killed on their home planes of existence. Second, anything eaten by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">the Snarl</a>, a living rift in the fabric of reality, is assuredly gone.
<ul><li> A black dragon attempted to do this to Vaarsuvius' children in revenge, by using necromancy to bind their souls and then leaving the earthly plane of existence. Even this would not have permanently killed them, but it would have removed them from Vaarsuvius's reach for all practical purposes.
</li><li> When Kubota surrenders to Elan and explains that he'll just rig his trial and drag it out for as long as possible, Vaarsuvius deems this a waste of the heroes' time and casts a spell that turns him into a pile of ash. Followed by a wind spell that blows the ashes out to sea. While there are still spells in D&amp;D that can resurrect him, it requires extremely powerful allies and costs a fortune to perform. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of the Giant</a> says that <em>True Resurrection</em> will not appear in the comic, so anyone who gets disintegrated is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>.
</li><li> Roy's father can't be brought back to life because he died of old age.
</li><li> Similar to Kubota, Malack and Nale are now Deader Than Dead due to their bodies being destroyed. Malack was a vampire, killed when Nale removed his sun protection spell, burning him to ash. In response, Tarquin killed Nale and Laurin disintegrated his body. She declared that if Malack can't be resurrected, nether can his killer. Additionally, while Nale might be brought back by <em>True Resurrection</em>, even this narrative-breaking spell could not bring back Malack since he was a vampire. Using <em>True Resurrection</em> on him would bring back the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizard Folk</a> shaman he once was, not the vampire he had become.
</li></ul></li><li> While every player in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>'s Sburb has an extra life, it's still possible to be killed permanently if that life is destroyed. Still, one of the people killed this way has come back, so who knows? And besides, they still exist in afterlife in some form, from which they can be summoned if their remains are used to prototype a sprite.
<ul><li> Characters who die now get a special <strong>DEAD</strong> caption, just so that there's no confusion. And just to ram the point home, Hussie released <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006189">this page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is a who's who of who's dead.
</li><li> In addition, Lord English has access to a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapon</a> that completely disintegrates anything it hits, up to the level of universes. His first on-screen use of it is on many afterlife characters (including the version of John from Davesprite's timeline, two doomed timeline versions of Dave, and numerous instances of the trolls), who are then... gone. Aranea implies that anyone hit by it is permanently obliterated.
<ul><li> In Troll mythology, Lord English is even known as the Angel of Double-Death for this very reason.

Dirk's narration implies that the venom straight-up erased John from the narrative of the story itself - no force in the entire mythology of the comics has the power to fix that.
</li></ul></li><li> Since the world of Arkerra in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GuildedAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GuildedAge">Guilded Age</a></em> is both a fully realized fantasy universe and a MMO game played by ordinary humans from Earth, player characters tend to respawn quickly after dying. However, certain threats from "outside" Arkerra are capable of permanently corrupting or outright deleting a character from the universe.

<ul><li> A Transformer can survive an insane amount of punishment, and many characters come back after being declared dead, or taking an amount of damage that really, <em>really</em> oughta do the job. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">Chunky Salsa Rule</a> is but a suggestion. This isn't to say that Transformers <em>never</em> stay dead... but nobody ever knows what to make of a character's death. There's always someone else who went through worse and was just fine, or fixable, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">rebuildable</a> into a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">toy, er, body</a>.)

</li><li> Compared to that, Ravage's feats of Deader than Dead survival seem unimpressive. However, Ravage is in an exploding ship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a>,</em> and we see his head kicked knocked off a cliff later—the writers assuring us that he's not "five minutes in a CR Chamber" dead, but really, seriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> dead. <em>Three</em> different comic series have found <em>different</em> ways of bring him back.
</li><li> Another way to terminate a Transformer with extreme prejudice? <em>Rip out its spine</em> and use the barely-recognizable carcass to whack another enemy over the head. That's the aforementioned kitty's fate in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">live-action film series</a>. And in the movieverse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a> is averted; so far, everyone who looked dead <em>was</em> dead if you didn't apply Allspark energy. But no, Ravage lives on in the comics (though his death and mysterious return were acknowledged, and Soundwave can't sense him anymore, meaning it's less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">Unexplained Recovery</a> and more "someone/something brought him back but <em>not</em> as he was before.") But in all these cases, the original writer wanted the characters capital-D Dead, took steps to show us that yes, this is death-death and not "Waspinator kablooification of the week..." and underestimated the ability of writers to follow to <em>easily</em> think of a way around it.

When Teodora turns her to stone by showing her a selfie she took with her, she then destroys Medusa by pushing her into a lava pit.
