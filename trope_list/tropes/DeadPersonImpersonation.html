</p><p>This can be for any number of reasons. Perhaps the character was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter">drifter</a>, with no identity of their own worth speaking of and enticed by the possibility of assuming the role of their recently deceased acquaintance. They may have promised to protect the person's loved ones, want to escape their old life, or less heroically intend to con their new "family" out of money. If anyone questions their changed appearance, accent, or other details, there's often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyUnverifiableCoverStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyUnverifiableCoverStory">Conveniently Unverifiable Cover Story</a> they can use to explain it away.

</p><p>Occasionally the impostor will be played sympathetically, in which case they may be forced to assume the dead person's identity to escape death themselves. Or, in a subversion, they could have been misidentified after a mass-casualty incident, and refrained from pointing out the mistake due to fear of prosecution, sympathy for the dead person's loved ones (who believe the deceased "miraculously survived!"), or even amnesia.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> has several cases:
<ul><li> Decades before the series took place a Japanese man named Yoshifusa Yabuchi went to live in Brazil, married a black Brazilian lady and became both friends and associates with Dickson Tanaka, a half-Japanese/half-Brazilian man. When Yoshifusa and his wife died, leaving a young son named Carlos behind, Dickson found out that Yoshifusa's older brother Yoshichika (the patriarch of a <em>very</em> rich family) had also perished in Japan just after learning of Yoshifusa's death. Realizing that the remaining Yabuchis were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big, Screwed-Up Family</a>, Dickson decided to make sure that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe">his sort-of adoptive son Carlos</a> wouldn't be cheated out of his dad's share of the <em>massive</em> inheritance; knowing that Yoshichika's relatives wouldn't remember how Yoshifusa looked like since they were extremely young when they left, Dickson took up Yoshifusa's identity and made Carlos pass as his bodyguard, so he could observe the family closer and keep Carlos safe. His gambit worked, but at a <em>very</em> high price: Yoshichika's greedy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> of widow, Machiko, tried to kill Dickson in the bath and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">being a skilled martial artist</a>, he killed her in self-defense.
</li><li> In an early case, a man killed his best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse">to get his insurance money</a>. Then he hid the friend's corpse and hired an actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble">to impersonate said friend.</a> THEN, he hired Kogoro for the apparently easy work of following the actor around, tricking him into believing said actor was the friend... so when the body was found some days later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Kogoro became the provider of the "murderous best friend"'s alibi</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">much to his anger</a>. Fortunately, Conan managed to find the mistakes within said plan (like the actor being a southpaw whereas the dead man wasn't) and reveal the tricks used.
</li><li> Much later, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeLady">Office Lady</a> strangled her best friend to death after a huge fight. She created an alibi for herself by putting on the dead girl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita">Elegant Gothic Lolita</a> dress plus a wig, then walking around in such an ensemble while "calling" the victim to her cellphone, and <em>then</em> returning to the crime scene to re-dress the corpse.

It is revealed in his profile that he was Burton Harris from v2, except he was the <em>real</em> Burton Harris, and the one that died in the previous game was the real Ken Lawson, his best friend. Burton hadn't wanted to go on the school trip, and convinced Ken to go in his place. Due to the fact that they looked almost identical to each other, Ken was able to successfully pass himself off as Burton, only to be abducted and die in the game. Burton then took Ken's identity and moved across the country, trying to start up anti-SOTF movements in Ken's name. He never forgave himself for the identity-swap, not even when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he died by accidentally burying himself alive</span>.

<ul><li> Reino Hayhanen, the incompetent fellow-spy of Rudolf Abel, was an ethnic Finn from the Soviet Union. A certain man had been born in the US but grown up in Finland, eventually dying. Hayhanen was smuggled into Finland (truck with a false bottom), where he lived for two years as the dead man. He applied for and got the dead man's passportâ€”since the dead man had been born in the US, this allowed Hayhanen to enter and live in the US as a citizen.
</li><li> A slight twist: in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, a counterintelligence plot was conceived by the British, to feed the Germans false information regarding the invasion of Southern Europe. It revolved on making it appear that a plane, en route from Britain to their North African Army HQ, had crashed off the coast of Spain, and a messenger carrying a bag with some highly confidential papers floated ashore, drowned. To turn the corpse they obtained to that end into a "real" person that could stand scrutiny by enemy investigators (both in Spain, and possibly agents in Britain too), the person behind the plot, Captain Montagu, took on the identity of the messenger on several occasions.
</li><li> A man named Jeffrey Howe was murdered and his body cut into pieces so his killers could <a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8456886.stm">take his identity and home<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (after he decided to stop them being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave">The Thing That Would Not Leave</a>).
</li><li> On May 15, 1591, Tsarevich Dmitri Ivanovich, son of Ivan IV and half-brother of then-Tsar Fedor, died of a mysterious knife wound. Rumor initially had it that he was killed by Boris Godunov, father-in-law of Fedor and basically the ruler of Russia (Fedor had...problems), who wanted to become tsar after the childless tsar died. Anyway, the rumors go away, Fedor dies, and Boris becomes tsar. This goes well for him until around 1600, when in the midst of famine and a lot of social tension, a man in Poland claims to be Tsarevich Dmitri, gathers an army, and invades to kill the "usurper". Civil war ensues. Eventually, "Dmitri" takes the throne, but within a year he is killed by a conspiracy of boyars under Prince Vasili Shuiskii. Yet, rumors come out that "Tsar Dmitri" survived, the civil war restarts, and then another man claims to be "Tsar Dmitri." He is killed. Then ANOTHER man claims to be the now-thrice-murdered tsar. Then he is killed, Mikhail Romanov is made tsar, and the rest is history.
</li><li> A common past technique for creating a fake identity in the U.S. was to learn the name and birth date of a child who died in infancy fifteen years earlier, then apply for a Social Security number under that name, as if the kid were getting his or her first summer job. Not used so much nowadays, as federal and local demographic databases can more easily synch up and spot the discrepancy, and there are stricter guards on infant death certificates.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1n47i');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1n47i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1n47i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It used to be that <em>anyone</em> could get a child's death certificate with just the name and birth date, and the information on <em>that</em> enabled the scammer to obtain the birth certificate.</span>
<ul><li> A similar trick was used in Britain to provide suitable cover identities for undercover police officers infiltrating supposed terrorist organisations, most of which turned out to be largely harmless environmental activists on closer examination when some documents were leaked to the media. The children's next-of-kin were <em>not</em> pleased.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the most famous real life cases is the story of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Guerre">Martin Guerre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which has inspired a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MartinGuerre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MartinGuerre">fictional works.</a> The real Guerre abandoned his family, and several years later, a man returned claiming to be him. Things went well for a while, but then that man was accused by his in-laws of being an impostor. In this case, things went wrong because the real Guerre was still alive and returned, and the fake one, actually named Arnaud du Thil, was sentenced to death.
</li><li> The Borges Tom Castro story described under the Literature heading is a retelling of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichborne_claimant">Tichborne claimant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> incident. A man (real name Arthur Orton, AKA Tom Castro) claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne, the disappeared heir to a wealthy and aristocratic English family.
</li><li> Many people have been disqualified from military service over the years due to medical conditions, most of which aren't all that serious. One (quite illegal) way around this is to enlist under a false identity. The person you're trying to impersonate need not actually be dead, though if not, it certainly helps to get his assistance before attempting a stunt like that.
</li><li> After the Russian Revolution and murder of the Romanov family, it was rumored that <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_Romanov">Grand Duchess Anastasia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidAnastasiaSurvive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidAnastasiaSurvive">somehow survived and/or escaped</a>. For years, many people disputed this, and several claimed to be her, the most notorious impostor being <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Anderson">Anna Anderson.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> After several DNA tests, the remains of all four Grand Duchesses have been confirmed found, thereby proving that none escaped.
</li><li> One major avenue of Medicare fraud in the US (and no doubt having variants in other countries) is to steal many beneficiary identities and run them through fake procedures in scam mills. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fbi.gov/atlanta/press-releases/2011/doctor-pleads-guilty-to-billing-medicare-and-medicaid-for-counseling-sessions-with-dead-patients">Sometimes, the identities used are of dead people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

He fared pretty well too, until <a class="urllink" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-fake-mom-20120522,0,7407899.story">he decided to take out a lawsuit under her name<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
