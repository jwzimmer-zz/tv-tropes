<p>Video games (and games in general) are a unique storytelling medium in that they demand active participation by the audience (read: the player) in order to advance the narrative. Historically, however, the massive age gap between traditional, non-interactive storytelling and the rapidly evolving interactive medium gave rise to a dichotomy of pure gameplay vs. storytelling, which for the purpose of this article are defined as follows:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Gameplay</strong> is the type of interaction between the players and the video game where the players input commands to overcome <em>challenges</em> the game throws at them. Historically, the most common type of gameplay is combat, but it also includes puzzle-solving, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame">stealth</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization">Character Customization</a>, etc., etc.
</li><li> <strong>Story</strong> is the type of interaction between the player and the video game where the game <em>narrates</em> a story<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0e92x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0e92x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0e92x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not just the main plot, but also character arcs, themes, and setting exposition.</span> to the player, which typically provides narrative context for various elements of the game. Traditionally, video games narrate via cutscenes and dialogues (even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DialogueTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DialogueTree">interactive dialogue</a> overlaps with gameplay).
</li></ul><p>Another definition would be that the gameplay ultimately revolves around numbers and is governed by mathematical rules, while the story revolves around words and symbols and is governed by the rules of emotional narrative. Either way, it is very rare for a video game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem">not to have any story whatsoever</a> (i.e. the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pong">Pong</a></em> level of storylessness) and, even more so, to not have any gameplay (though this depends on whether you count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticNovel">Kinetic Novels</a> as games), and these two aspects are usually integrated at least a little — after all, you can hardly introduce pony-breeding gameplay against the backdrop of a galaxy-spanning war story. Similarly, it is often impossible to extricate the "gameplay" part from the "story" part for some game elements: for example, level design serves a practical function for gameplay, but also conveys information about the game's setting to the player — and attempting to avoid this by setting one's gameplay in an environment comprised entirely of featureless white cubes would still tell the player <em>something</em> about the game's setting. Additionally, while it is virtually impossible for a game to have <em>no</em> story at all, story is not the only aspect that evokes an emotional reaction in the players, and "raw" gameplay can have the same effect in its own right, independent of the context it is placed in.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Since a gap between gameplay and story exists and despite the medium's relative youth, video games have already developed a rather standardized set of general and genre-specific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTropes">gameplay conventions</a>. While definitely not as old as storytelling conventions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">they are not fundamentally different and game designers often borrow from them</a> without considering how they fit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>. Indeed, very few players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">stop to ponder why</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>'s well-being seems to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">divided into numbered chunks</a> but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">the only one that matters is the last</a>, because it's an established gameplay convention and most developers no longer feel the need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> it. This becomes even more obvious when the game's gameplay rules are adapted from an external source, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">Tabletop Games</a>.
</p><p>This leads to situations where gameplay rules blatantly contradict the story rules — and such cases are usually easily identifiable and are listed on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> page. But again, few games segregate their gameplay from the story <em>completely</em>, and there is usually an overlap at least on the contextual or thematic level. Likewise, there are practically no video games where the gameplay and the story are integrated so tightly that they become indistinguishable, if only because the technology for procedurally generated narratives does not yet exist. Therefore, it's more accurate to speak of individual <em>instances</em> of gameplay and story integration/segregation, as a single game can provide examples of both; ultimately, "gameplay and story integration" is less of a dichotomy and more of a continuum, and games can be sorted based on whether integration instances outnumber segregation ones or vice versa.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The Sliding Scale of Gameplay and Story Integration is then defined as follows:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Perfect Integration</strong>: The gameplay <em>is</em> the story. This standard seems to be most prevalent in genres that aim for <em>emergent</em> narrative — like many life sim and management sim games, for example — though those genres' particular definition of what constitutes "story" is looser and broader than most.
</li><li> <strong>Deliberate Integration</strong>: The developers take a critical look at both the gameplay and narrative conventions, then employ one to reinforce the other. Ironically, the more formulaic the genre-specific gameplay is, the easier its formula is to adapt to a story. See below for a list of common tricks to get a game up here. There <em>are</em> cases of deliberate integration done well, even in innovative ways, but greater awareness and diversity in games and game genres has led to integration being forced to inflate perceptions of a game's "depth." Games within the Deliberate Integration category could just as easily be placed on their own continuum, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">this scale simply sorts games by integration of gameplay and story without delving into questions of art and quality</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Natural Integration</strong>: The vast majority of games falls in the bloated middle of the scale, where the gameplay and the story draw from separate convention pools but there is enough conceptual overlap for the player to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">just ignore small internal inconsistencies</a>. Since it is so common, a list of games in this category would be far too long to be of any use.
</li><li> <strong>Conspicuous Segregation</strong>: Games this far down the scale are featured prominently on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> page, may suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayTheGameSkipTheStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayTheGameSkipTheStory">Play the Game, Skip the Story</a> attitude, or have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Plot</a> to begin with. Note that even when the discrepancy between the gameplay and the story becomes glaringly obvious this far down, the two still remain integrated at some level.
</li><li> <strong>Total Segregation</strong>: Where the gameplay has nothing to do with the story whatsoever. Like Perfect Integration, it is mostly an imaginary category to cap off the scale.
</li></ul><p>The degree of story and gameplay integration in a particular game is always relative to the "mean level" of it in its genre. Story-driven genres like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame">adventures</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a>, for instance, traditionally feature a much higher level of integration than the competitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacingGame">Racing</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Games</a>. Note, however, that a particular game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryToGameplayRatio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryToGameplayRatio">Story-to-Gameplay Ratio</a> does not imply anything about the extent to which its gameplay is integrated with its story. Ultimately, deliberate gameplay and story integration is all about recognizing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">particular genre's gameplay or story formulas</a> and interlocking them in a way that is not expected in that genre. Off the above scale lie the aforementioned games that lack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem">either a story</a> or gameplay of any kind, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergentNarrative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergentNarrative">Emergent Narrative</a> — the metaphorical Holy Grail for some developers, wherein the game's generic ruleset facilitates the players inventing and enjoying stories all on their own. Some would argue that this is what the Perfect Integration sector of the scale is all about, but then again, so are non-kinetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovels">Visual Novels</a>.
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerAndProtagonistIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerAndProtagonistIntegration">Player and Protagonist Integration</a>, a scale that deals with similar issues regarding exactly where the line is drawn between the "player" as an agent outside the narrative's confines and the "protagonist" as a character (typically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>) within that same narrative.
</p><hr/><h2>Things to look out for:</h2>
<p>Common tricks for gameplay and story integration include:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InjuredPlayerCharacterStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InjuredPlayerCharacterStage">Translating plot-related injuries into gameplay terms</a>, such as:
<ul><li> A plot injury limiting gameplay options in a unusual way: if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> breaks a limb or two, certain abilities or even actions may be disabled for a few levels; after suffering a (partial) blindness or brain damage, massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a> can be expected; being suddenly rendered mute may prevent the character from casting spells, initiating dialogue, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">playing automatic voice snippets</a> (like battle cries and victory quips).
</li><li> Alternatively, injuries sustained during cutscenes/dialogue can simply stick with the character in form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoint">Hit Point</a> loss or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a> that are ordinarily sustained in regular combat. This is usually done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">immediately before a fight for additional challenge</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Tweaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameAI">the AI</a> to make characters behave differently in gameplay, not just the story:
<ul><li> Individual enemy AI can be tweaked to reflect their personal agendas: for example, an enemy may concentrate on a party member they consider their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> and ignore everyone else, or, conversely, never directly attack a particular party member at all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCompanion">Non-Player Companion</a> AI can be tweaked to reflect their personality quirks, allegiances, and relationships. For instance, a party member may prioritize healing and buffing allies based on their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a>, or spontaneously try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">take a bullet</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate">another party member</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameSystem">Game System</a> as canvas — that is, defining plot elements in terms of the underlying gameplay rules:
<ul><li> Accurately reflecting characters' story characterization in their gameplay stats and, conversely, the stats in their story-relevant abilities. While it is trivial that a melee fighter would have a high Strength score, it is much less common for him to use that strength for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatisticallySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatisticallySpeaking">anything except bashing skulls</a> (e.g., for lifting a fallen tree to free someone trapped under it). Particularly common is the use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckStat">Luck Stat</a> to reflect a character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Born Lucky</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky">Unlucky</a>, since the latter tropes can be exploited for a number of subplots or simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gags</a>.
</li><li> Giving individual supporting characters unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Perk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Perk">perks</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasASpecialMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasASpecialMove">special abilities</a> that reflect their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. Or, conversely, removing some of the player's abilities after plot events transpire that should render them useless.
</li><li> Having characters use the same abilities in cutscenes as they would in actual gameplay — better yet, have them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCutsceneInventoryInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCutsceneInventoryInertia">only use said abilities to the extent that they have developed them in gameplay terms</a> up to that point.
</li></ul></li><li> ...Or the reverse, taking care that some or all of the major themes of the story are also represented during actual play in the form of game mechanics, sort of the interactive media equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">Show, Don't Tell</a>.
</li><li> Adding alternate NPC dialogue (or even cutscenes) based on the gameplay state of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>, such as:
<ul><li> Being badly wounded or suffering from certain status effects.
</li><li> Approaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsInChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsInChurch">a friendly NPC with weapons drawn</a> or an enemy, with weapons sheathed.
</li><li> Wearing or not wearing certain pieces of functional equipment (often body armor), or not wearing anything at all.

<ul><li> All of the enemy biographies mention that the demons in Castle Mallet haven't seen practice since the middle ages at least, so Dante showing up quite literally guns blazing gives him a massive advantage over them because they don't even know what a gun <em>is</em>. In gameplay, almost every enemy in the game can be chumped by shooting them, or shooting them opens up massive vulnerabilities that the sword alone couldn't.
</li><li> The Nightmare Alpha "gun" is mentioned to be a handheld prototype version of the Nightmare boss. Because they use similar demon energies for their attacks, Nightmare is completely immune to Nightmare Alpha in every circumstance.
</li><li> The beastiary entries are - presumably - being written by Dante as he goes along as reminders to himself as to what works. As such, it won't update until Dante actually witnesses the enemy doing/reacting to something in a fight with them, such as penning down notable attacks and theorizing/confirming weaknesses he gets to act on.

<ul><li> Nero can't use his Devil Breaker in the prologue because Nico hasn't developed them yet.
</li><li> It's mentioned outright that the amount of complexity in such a small package makes the Breakers extremely fragile, which is reflected by them breaking if Nero uses its Overcharge or takes damage while using it (it takes the blow for him). Also, while Nico is constantly developing new ones, the big hitters or more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> arms require Nero or V killing a powerful demon and giving her a body part from it, either as inspiration or as a power source.
</li><li> If Nero revs up the Red Queen in a cutscene or his taunt where he stabs the ground and revs it, when gameplay resumes he'll actually have level 1 Exceed ready.
</li><li> In Nico's notes, it's mentioned that emotion is what makes demons stronger, with love and resolve (emotions unknown to demons) being the two greatest factors, which explains why the half-and-quarter-demon Sparda family can be so powerful. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nero awakening his Devil Trigger with a massive outburst of both the above emotions gives him the power to stop Dante and Vergil in their place even with both in Sin Devil Trigger Form, cold-clock Dante unconscious and overpower Vergil despite still being far below them in experience and relative power and having JUST awoken his Devil form.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Nearly <em>everything</em> the player does in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em> — from how many enemies she kills to which logbooks she reads — has at least some influence on how the story unfolds, how dialogues proceed, and even how characters react to Iji's presence. Indeed, the ending of one subplot (which can only be followed by reading a series of seemingly unrelated logbooks) relies on how the player treats a single specific enemy she has no way of knowing is at all significant at that point in the game. Meanwhile, every gameplay mechanic from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon">Swiss Army Weapon</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadRunnerPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadRunnerPC">Road Runner PC</a> is explained in the narrative, usually via logbooks.
</li><li> Just about every in-game mechanic in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> series ties into the fact that the games all take place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualReality">Virtual Reality</a> recreations of the lives of the protagonist's ancestors. When the player dies or fails a mission, he's said to have "desynchronized" (i.e. failed to accurately duplicate his ancestors' actions), he's able to retry missions because he can restart the simulation at will, he can pause or stop at will by disconnecting himself from the terminal, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> is equated with "100% Synchronization" (i.e. recreating his ancestors' lives with 100% accuracy). Even the gameplay advances between games are justified in-story: Desmond accesses his ancestors' memories through slightly more advanced versions of the Animus (the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em>, for example, are played through the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Animus 2.0</a>"), and each Animus is able to recreate certain features of the real world that the others couldn't. This is why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em> features much more detailed urban environments than the first game, and why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em> features detailed forest environments for the first time in the series.
</li><li> For a game-specific example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood">Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</a></em>, Ezio's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">Bag of Spilling</a> on his parkour skills are justified with Ezio being <em>ancient</em> by the standards of the time period (40 in Renaissance Italy was an acheivment, much less one lived as dangerously as his was) and spent a period of time comatose and feverish with no medicine to help him after being shot. Getting Ezio back to his full climbing condition requires getting Leonardo Da Vinci's help to design a harness that helps with Ezio's aging and damaged muscles.
</li><li> In most levels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBountyHunter">Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</a></em>, the "bounty-hunting" function, which lets the player ID-scan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mooks</a> and civilians to root out ones with prices on their heads, is a simple side-quest that the player can pursue for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>. But in the final stage of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">"Oovoo IV"</a> level, one of the optional bounties turns out to be Meeko Ghintee (the criminal who the player captures in the first level as part of the main story), who is wanted dead for crimes that he committed earlier in the game. Earlier, Roz had mentioned Meeko getting "...another life sentence on Oovoo IV" before he vanished from the game. And in the final boss stage, the player can ID-scan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Komari Vosa</a> to bring up a description of the bounty that started the game's main plot. Scanning her is a moot point, since she can't be captured alive, and the game automatically triggers a cutscene when the player kills her, but it still shows that the developers thought to factor the game's story into the ID-scanning mechanic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance">Marvel Ultimate Alliance</a></em>, the player can avert the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a> at the end of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireAndBrimstoneHell">Mephisto's Realm</a>" level—which forces the player to choose whether to rescue Jean Grey or Nightcrawler—by selecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> for the main party. Because of his magnetic powers, Magneto can manipulate the metal in the cage that Mephisto keeps Jean and Kurt imprisoned in, allowing him to rescue both of them. If the player <em>doesn't</em> select Magneto for that level, the epilogue reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">either choice will ultimately result in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">the X-Men disbanding permanently</a></span> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10pr8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10pr8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10pr8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Failing to save Jean will lead to her coming back as the Dark Phoenix and slaughtering the whole team; failing to save Kurt will lead to his mother, Mystique, murdering Professor Xavier in retaliation.</span> </span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a></em>, aside from having a few special units per faction, there is generally very little difference in how the various factions play on the battlefield. A notable exception is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceBase">Polis Massa</a> map in the second game, where the Separatist faction has a major strategy advantage. Why? Polis Massa is located on an asteroid, and part of the map extends to the asteroid's surface, which is unprotected from the vacuum of space. Separatist battle droids are the only units that can move freely across the surface without vehicles (giving them a good shortcut into enemy territory), since they don't need to breathe.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> games (as well as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em>) go to great lengths to design the whole worldbuilding about the multiplayer elements and unlimited character lives. The Souls games are set in cyclical universes consisting of infinite parallel worlds and at the end of the cycle time flows in irregular ways and people constantly move between different worlds. The player characters are also undead, so they never really die but only find themselves back in the same place they were in a few minutes ago. They CAN be defeated, but only mentally; if they die too many times they'll lose track of their purpose and go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Hollow</a>, effectively suffering a death of personality. For most undead this only takes a few deaths, but for the player character, they can do so hundreds of times... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">they only lose their will to continue if you do.</a> Which also makes it possible that some characters appear in multiple games even though apparently thousands of years have passed. The standard RPG "leveling up by killing enemies" mechanic is also justified by the lore: your character, in-universe, is progressively becoming more powerful by absorbing the souls of others. How many souls you have is directly proportionate to your strength, hence why boss souls are worth so much more than a mook's.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em> is less explicit about it but is still set in a world where the dreams and the waking world are almost indistinguishable and forces are at work that are transcending reality. However the Insight system, the game's version of Humanity that originated in the <em>Dark Souls</em> series, still ties in deeply with the world. Whenever you kill a boss, or randomly when something spooky or "not right" happens that seems a bit out of place in a Victorian Horror setting, you'll gain a pip of Insight. Once you get to 30 Insight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure">Glamour Failure</a> begins to kick in (ahead of killing Rom the Vacuous, which irreversibly changes the game world entirely), because you can begin to perceive the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">Cosmic Horror Story</a> you're actually playing; you begin to see enemies' true forms, and see the monsters that were previously in plain sight, but your character's mind couldn't process their presence. Also related, higher Insight lowers your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">Frenzy</a> resistance, because if you're already capable of perceiving the horrific, maddening sights you witness, it only becomes easier for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">incomprehensible</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">monstrosities</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">give you more than you can handle</a>.

<ul><li> Traditionally, Link begins the game with only three hearts. The Link in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em> is an exception; he starts out with a full six. That's because <em>this</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">incarnation of Link</a> has been explicitly training as a knight, whereas other Links have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">mere</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">children</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">farmers</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">train conductors</a>. He's more physically fit and has more stamina than the other Links. And while the Link in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em> was also trained as a knight, he was also in cryostasis for 100 years: everything you do in BotW is under the idea that you're regaining your strength before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once again</span> fighting Ganon.
</li><li> <em>Breath of the Wild</em> has the Yiga Clan, who are a group of evil ninjas on the side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Their scouts can be encountered in the field under the disguise of a traveler or merchant. When you defeat their leader, he vows that his gang will follow you everywhere no matter where you go. He is not kidding. Defeating the leader only makes the clan more bold and they will start appearing out of nowhere at anytime to attack you on sight.
<ul><li> Speaking of the Yiga Clan, the members that are encountered in disguise in the overworld only attack Link when he speaks with them directly. In the DLC memory Champion Urbosa's Song, they do the same. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except that instead of talking with them, she challenges them to fight her, knowing that they were disguised Yiga.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Also from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, Daruk's journal in "The Champions' Ballad" DLC mentions that Link was appointed as Zelda's personal bodyguard after he used a pot lid to deflect a Guardian's laser - a difficult, yet completely possible feat to accomplish in game.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em>, survivors who have a gun, when they take too much damage, will take their own lives.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em> decides to justify Samus' use (or lack of use) or her suit functions as her deferring to the orders of her former C.O. Adam Malkovich. Fans, particularly Western ones, thought this justification very thin from the get go, as they didn't think Samus should've been under orders from <em>anyone</em>, and definitely not when obeying Adam's orders became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">actively detrimental to her survival</a>. Eventually, Samus <em>does</em> start ignoring Adam's orders and self-authorizing suit functions, but to most fans, it was too little, too late.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em> makes a similar, less-fandom-dividing justification as she becomes infected by the X-Parasite and, as she's unconscious, the Galactic Federation cuts off chunks of her suit and decides to send them off to research the samples contained on them. Thus, Samus' upgrades were literally sliced off of her and she has to gain them back through upgrade stations or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">killing and absorbing X-Parasites that use similar abilities</a>. Why not just send her all of her upgrades? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Because the Galactic Federation intended to capture SA-X and deliberately withheld from Samus to discourage her from engaging it.</span> They even justify the health and ammo pickups in the game as they're stray parasites that Samus is capable of absorbing, due to the infusion of Metroid DNA to save her life from the initial infection.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS">inFAMOUS</a></em> games Cole and Delsin's EXP is divided as both Hero, Neutral and Infamous and earning either Hero or Infamous EXP will tip the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> into the direction of which is higher. This also determines how your powers emerge.

<ul><li> If you look closely during the final boss of the first game, you'll notice that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> most of Kessler's attacks are more powerful versions of Cole's attacks, acting as a last bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> before the big reveal of Kessler's true identity.</span>

<ul><li> The Square button is devoted to having Atreus shoot a targeted enemy, among other context sensitive actions or attack calls on various enemies. After Atreus has learned of his divine heritage and may be suffering a bit of corruption from a key rune he picked up in Tyr's vault, he begins to behave coldly and cruelly thinking "I'm a god, I can do whatever I want". At this point in the story until Kratos shakes some sense into him, Atreus will often times ignore Kratos'/the players commands, attack enemies you're not targeting, and use his mana-using, on-long-cooldown attacks without being prompted.
</li><li> Starting out his journey, Atreus was an unblooded child who hadn't even killed a game animal. While he's a fair shot with a bow, he's pretty much just that. As the game goes on and Atreus has both positive and negative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> - combined with the player putting points into his skills, his arrows become more damaging because he's learning how to aim for vitals, he'll stun enemies by kick jumping off of them and shooting or getting them in a chokehold with his bow, and eventually he'll reach the point where he'll trip an enemy up and stab them to death with his hunting knife to their throat while they're down. Fitting in with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passing the Torch</a> theme between Kratos and Atreus, a properly-leveled Atreus is <em>stronger and more versatile than Kratos</em> by the end of the game.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em>, the characters have voice-acted sound bits for the beginning of a battle, the end of a battle, taunting, blocking, getting hit, and executing attacks (and other things if the character is the loudmouth, Bang). If the character is fighting someone who is strongly tied to his or her character arc, what they say will be different in all of these instances.
<ul><li> Every character's fighting style is clearly influenced by their personalities and life experiences.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCentralFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCentralFiction">Central Fiction</a></em>, Terumi has been separated from his vessel Hazama.

</li><li> This even makes its way into the narrative sequences. For instance, fitting one of the last users of True Magic in the setting, Nine is a zoning beast with a vast array of special moves to keep her opponent guessing, but all her evasion has startup lag and she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">no defensive tools whatsoever</a>, leaving her vulnerable if the foe gets close enough to rush her down.

</li><li> The various gameplay abilities the characters have exist in the lore as well, so in cinematics and comics youll see things like D.Va inventing her self destruct Ultimate, Genji countering Hanzos Twin Dragons attack with his own, Winston going into Berserk Mode when sufficiently angered, or Reapers passive abilities manifesting as him inflicting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal">unhealing wounds</a> on people.
</li><li> In the "Infiltration" short, Reaper fights solo against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, and though the battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">sadly happens offscreen</a>, it's clear from the results that it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> in Reaper's favour. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">metagame</a>, Reaper is the #1 choice for killing Tank characters, which the mech certainly would be if it was a playable character.
</li><li> Doomfist's entire kit is designed to bring overwhelming power on weaker opponents, but he can be countered by other tanks. So in his introduction cinematic, he effortlessly takes out Genji and Tracer, but Winston weathers his blows and takes him down after entering berserk mode, which in-game fully heals him and doubles his health to 900; Doomfist's best attack deals 300 total.
</li><li> Characters often have unique voicelines for whatever map theyre in that reflect their in-story opinions, such as the omnic-hating Torbjörn and Zarya complaining about being in Numbani, or Winston being very uncomfortable in the Horizon Lunar Colony (where he grew up in canon).
</li><li> "Honor and Glory" shows that, back when he was a rookie, Reinhardt was a brash, overconfident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker">Glory Seeker</a> who frequently charged ahead of his team and left them to fend for themselves. In other words, he acted <em>exactly</em> like bad or rookie Reinhardt players tend to in the game.
</li><li> "Retribution" depicts a Blackwatch mission that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">went horribly wrong</a> because Reaper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">went off-plan at the worst time</a> and the team was working on bad intel. Fittingly, the team's composition is absolutely <em>horrible</em> for the sort of hellish meat grinder the mission became; Moira's healing cannot keep up with the damage the Talon mooks deal, Reaper and McCree's own damage-dealing is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">impractical</a> thanks to the lack of any tanks, and Genji's Deflect move is easily overwhelmed by all the heavy gunners. Contrast all of that with the more typical Overwatch mission seen in "Storm Rising", where everything goes according to plan and the intel is good. The team composition is <em>much</em> better and the gameplay is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherLevel">correspondingly less difficult</a>; Mercy is a far better dedicated healer, Winston can tank and put down a barrier, Tracer can evade attacks and heal herself with Rewind, and Genji can more easily deal damage with the proper back-up.

<ul><li> Sasha is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock">The Spock</a> who advocates rigid mental control, so his mind is a blank featureless box floating in a void that expands into specific memories on command.

</li><li> Boyd has Paranoid Schizophrenia, which causes almost everything in the level to look at you or sneak up on you in some way, which will make some players think that the level is trying to attack them. The mindscape's structure is very disjointed and fragmented, and occupied only by dueling conspiracies that are hiding in plain sight, reflecting Boyd's paranoia in the real world.
</li><li> Edgar suffers from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, which is represented by a bull that keeps running through the mindscape's town in a tightly-defined route, causing its inhabitants to do the same things constantly as they try to do their own things in spite of the bull. Getting in its way will knock you back to the start of the level, causing you to repeat parts of the world over and over again.
</li><li> Gloria has Bipolar Disorder, and you can change the mood lighting in her mental world to literally swing the mood of the stage between comedy and tragedy.
</li><li> Fred has Split Personality Disorder, so his world is actually two worlds; one world where he manipulates a game board inside of a castle while playing against his ancestor Napoleon Bonaparte, and a game world containing that castle.
</li><li> The final level takes place <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">within Raz's own head, after getting his mind in contact with Coach Oleander's</span> and it is not only frustratingly difficult, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final boss is completely invulnerable without the aid of another psychic</span>.

<ul><li> When X touches the floating Sigma Virus found in the levels, he'll get damaged periodically. In-story, X has the "Suffering Circuit" in his system which (along with Dr. Light's 30 years of testing) will prevent him from doing unethical things and keep his mind on track. The Sigma Virus will make any of the infected slowly go insane and homicidal (as with the bosses). X, with the circuit, will resist those urges, and the programming overload results in his body slowly damaging itself. Apparently the Reploids, based on X, all have flawed Suffering Circuits courtesy of Dr. Cain's incomplete understanding of X's design.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Zero will instead get stronger and eventually invincible after absorbing enough of the virus. In story, the Sigma Virus is a derivative of the Maverick Virus found alongside Zero's hibernation capsule, and said virus (according to a flashback in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4">Mega Man X4</a></em> and later on in the fifth game's bad ending) apparently is a key to a programming in Zero's mind which designates his purpose: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">the total destruction of society</a>. There's also some hints in the game that the Maverick Virus may or may not contain the consciousness of Zero's creator, Dr. Wily.

Shortly after this, Tails gives Sonic the Blue Star II, a board he had been working on just in case something happened to Sonic's first board and Sonic uses that board throughout the rest of the story as his default, even into the post-story Mission Mode.
<ul><li> At the climax of <em>Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity</em>, Sonic and the gang end up having the gravity altering devices they spent the story up to then using and fighting over stolen away and used to create the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere">Master Core: Abis.</a> In the following boss fight, not only are they locked out of any kind of gravity control until the Master Core invokes it himself, but the gravity control devices are completely absent from their character models. If you return to the track in any other mode with any other characters, THEIR gravity control devices and abilities will be gone, too.

Well, in-universe, the ocean is basically tied to Nerifes, the world's "god" - thus the sea is holy, and this <em>also</em> means that water aligned spells like Spread, Aqua Laser, and Tidal Wave are just as effective against dark enemies as light spells.

</li><li> Rydia learns black magic (attack spells). Like other <em>Final Fantasy</em> games, battle spells follow most of the standard element patterns (fire, ice/water, lightning). Rydia learns ice and lightning magic on her own by gaining levels, but not fire. Why? Her hometown was destroyed by a fire, and she <em>hates</em> fire as a result. She only finally unlocks fire magic when the group needs to proceed past a wall of ice to warn another town of an impending attack, and there are no other black magic users currently in the party.

<ul><li> It's stated in the story that Materia can form naturally, and such Materia is said to be rarer than man-made ones (they take at least <em>centuries</em> to form this way) and implied to be more powerful, as they're made by the planet itself. Some caves with natural Materia inside them can be accessed once the player breeds a gold chocobo, and not only they're the only copies the player can find in the entire game (the only way to obtain more is to master them), they all have particularly potent effects relative to most other Materia in their respective categories. The red one is Knights of the Round (<em>by far</em> the game's most powerful summon), the blue one is Quadra Magic (makes compatible spells linked to it be cast at half power four times in a row), the yellow one is Mime (a very versatile command) and the purple one swaps the user's HP and MP values (which turns them into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> with very low HP, but <em>extremely</em> high MP).

<ul><li> All of the character's classes are highly integrated into the plot. Vivi's ability to shoot stuff with fireballs with black magic becomes very important, the hidden Summons inside Garnet are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> unto themselves, and Freya, a dragoon, is able to leap to the tops of roofs effortlessly in cutscenes as easily as she can leap into the sky to use her "Jump" ability. Sometimes even their <em>personality traits</em> become gameplay mechanics; Zidane, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a>, has a "Protect Girls" skill that lets him jump in front of a female party member to protect her.
</li><li> Quina, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> of the group, has a unique ability where s/he can <em>eat</em> your enemies and potentially learn skills from them. Eat notably doesn't work on human enemies or powerful bosses.
</li><li> In at least two battles (one of which is mentioned below) the boss is coded to only target specific party members: Your three aside from Dagger in the fight with Black Waltz Number 2 (to the point were he'll cast AOE spells that in every other circumstance would hit all your party members <em>only</em> on those three), and Dagger specifically in a battle with the bounty hunter Lani. The former is tasked with returning Dagger to her mother, and if he succeeds in killing all of your party members aside from her, he'll cast a spell to put her to sleep and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">game will end</a>.
</li><li> In a similar instance to the above, the rematch against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Black Waltz Number 3</span> has similar stakes; they are tasked with returning Dagger to Brahne, and if they succeed in killing the rest of the party, instead of attacking, it will start hitting <em>itself</em> due to a combination of its mission (the only foe left is the one they're supposed to bring back alive) and some rather severe malfunctioning, by virtue of having their ass handed to them earlier. It's possible to win the fight by just letting your other members get killed, then wail on it with Dagger until it kills itself. This also doubles as a convenient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">anti-frustration feature</a>, since there's a lenghty several minute cutscene between the last savepoint and this bossfight which you'd have to watch every time you lost this fight, if it were possible.
</li><li> The opposite happens when you fight Lani. She's a Bounty Hunter charged with bringing the princess back, so all her attacks will be directed at Dagger. She'll even use Scan to figure out her stats. She's also quite vain, so if you physically attack her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInTheFace">she will yell something and counter immediately</a>.
</li><li> When Dagger loses her voice in the plot, during game-play her ability to cast spells is impaired: every couple of turns will fail with a "Can't concentrate." She gets better, though.
</li><li> Most characters will skip their post-battle victory poses during plot circumstances that concern them in some negative way, including Garnet losing her voice described above.
</li><li> Garnet can't summon her Eidolons on the first two discs and the in-story reason is that she is afraid of them. As a result, the MP costs for her Summons are incredibly high. When she has gotten over her fear of them by Disc 3, the MP costs are considerably lower. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note67p02');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note67p02" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note67p02');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The player <em>can</em> get her to summon them before they are extracted, but only through a max MP cheat or consistent levelling. If doing so naturally then this could tie into her becoming more confident in battle.</span>
</li><li> At the end of the Disk 2, Garnet tries to get an Eidolon that she can use to save her mother from Kuja in battle. The Eidolon she finds is Leviathan - whose attack is to conjure up a tidal wave to wipe out his enemies. As Queen Brahne is with the royal fleet on the ocean (while Kuja is airborne on his silver dragon), Garnet is heart broken she can't use Leviathan to help.
</li><li> The biggest example of this is probably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Trance State</a>. After witnessing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mog transform into Madeen</span> using Trance, Kuja deduces that Trance is the key to unlocking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> for himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's right, and he does... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">by having you defeat him in battle</a></span>. It also ties directly into Zidane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Dyne</a> abilities, all of which are a miniaturised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>:
<ul><li> Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> above, some characters' abilities are integrated into the plot; Yuna's summoning abilities are the crux of the whole storyline until the 3/4 point, and the whole first half of the game is about travelling to temples to obtain more summons for her. Tidus' Overdrives (and default skill-set) are all based around speed, precision and acrobatics - all essential skills for a star Blitzball player. He also learns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Time Magic</a>.
</li><li> When hit by a Lightning-spell in battle, most of your party simply grunt. Rikku, on the other hand, <em>screams</em>. This is either a nod to or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearOfThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearOfThunder">Fear of Thunder</a> (depending on when you first see it). In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">the sequel</a>, where she's over it, she doesn't do it anymore.
</li><li> At one point Lulu suggests she learn some elemental magic to help her master her fear. Rikku's Sphere Grid runs straight into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage">Lulu's</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">which starts with basic elemental magic</a>.
</li><li> A very subtle one; when fighting Seymour's first two forms, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Yuna and/or Tidus</a> are out on the field, he will direct the majority of his attacks at them, which makes sense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty">considering his rather</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe">awkward fixation on Yuna</a>. This can be advantageous if you focus on keeping one of them alive and present (easily done with Haste and Nul-spells) while wailing on him with everyone else.
</li><li> Kimahri is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueMage">Blue Mage</a> and his Lancet ability is what helps him learn the various skills. When fighting his Ronso brothers Biran and Yenke, they will have a lot of the Ronso Rage abilities too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The player had the option to choose Tidus's name in the first game, and it's never spoken aloud (due to that being the first voice-acted game in the franchise). In this, the characters won't refer to him by name. Rikku will only say "him" or "you know who", and Yuna's narration addresses Tidus personally so she will just say "you".
</li><li> The Dresspheres in the game come from spheres that were made from the memories and thoughts of various people throughout Spira. The Songstress in particular has massive plot significance; the musical-related abilities come from the fact that it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a> for Lenne. One thousand years ago, she was a singer and the costume is what she wore on stage. As she was also said to be out on the front lines fighting during the Machina War, it makes sense that she has other abilities. Likewise, the singing abilities in the game raise the party's stats, which also makes sense when you consider Yuna later giving a concert to motivate the Spirans to stop fighting amongst themselves. Presumably Lenne used her singing the same way when she was on the front lines.
</li><li> If you go to Lake Macalania during Chapter 3, you'll get the Berserker Dressphere from an Al Bhed man who dies in the fiend attacks. When the player ports back onto the Celsius from this, if you talk to Rikku, she won't respond.
</li><li> Paine is a very cold and withdrawn character. So if she's put into the flamboyant Songstress Dressphere, she <em>will</em> complain about it. And she will get very annoyed if you make her sing. She also doesn't change into it during cutscenes, while Yuna and Rikku do.
</li><li> Yuna no longer has her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a> due to the Fayth that gave birth to the Aeons being laid to rest at the end of the previous games. When the Aeons reappear, they've been corrupted by Shuyin.
</li><li> In the <em>Eternal Calm</em> prologue, Yuna is seen practicing holding her breath underwater at Besaid. Later in the game, the player has the option of playing Blitzball. Yuna couldn't in the previous game, but she can now. Rikku couldn't play Blitzball in the first game but she could breathe and fight underwater, so her learning in the two year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> is also justified. The rest of the Gullwings are Al Bhed, who already are used to going underwater.
</li><li> Gippal is an Al Bhed who was also a member of the Crimson Squad. So when you face him in battle, his abilities are based around machina (he uses a mortar to attack) in contrast to Nooj and Baralai's - as at the time he took part in the training, the other two had a taboo about using machina forbidden by Yevon.

<ul><li> One scene has Fran get induced with extra strength and near insanity, causing her to break free from her restraints. The fight after this scene reflects this by inducing the Berserk status on Fran.
</li><li> Manufactured Nethicite and Dawn Shard are plot-central items that are said to interfere with Mist, which is the game's source of magic: as a result, they can be equipped as accessories and increase magic defenses, but also put the wearer under permanent Silence status and reduce their MP to 0, respectively.
</li><li> Penelo makes her money as a dancer in Rabanastre. All her Quickenings involve her using various dances to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler">cast spells</a>.
</li><li> In the rematch against Ba'gamnan, he will only attack Balthier if he's in the party due to his hatred towards him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lightning runs around with a portable anti-gravity device in the inventory that is never used outside cutscenes... except that she is the only player character who never takes damage from falling (when hurled into the air by an enemy). This is actually a remnant of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">earlier concept</a>, where Lightning's powers were all based around gravity manipulation.
</li><li> There is a rather sneaky example early on, which becomes this in hindsight. All party members begin with 2 ATB-slots, except Vanille, who has 3. After becoming l'Cie, they all gain 1 — again, except Vanille, who still has 3. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's already a l'Cie, and has been for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">much longer than the other four playable characters</a>.</span>
</li><li> The Eidolon battle against Odin shows signs of this with his in-battle behavior. Before Odin appeared, Lightning was venting her frustration at Hope, who was following her and proved to be more of a hinderance than help because he's a civilian and has little to no combat experience. While battling Odin, he will specifically target his attacks on Hope, as Lightning wanted to get rid of him. In contrast, increasing the gauge on Odin requires Lightning to heal Hope, proving that her anger at him was unfounded and that she really isn't trying to get the kid killed.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the main mechanics of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyBraveExvius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyBraveExvius">Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</a></em> is what the game refers to as "visions", which are meant to justify the game's gacha system. However, one of the biggest plot twists of the game is a result of this system: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Veritas of the Dark is not Sir Raegen as everyone was assuming him to be (even the other Veritas), but he's revealed to actually have <em>been</em> Raegen all along—he was actually a vision of Raegen during the war between Aldore and Hess summoned by Veritas of the Light. This has been previously hinted at with the Lightlord being able to use visions to summon enemies to aid her during her battle with the party.</span>
<ul><li> A more minor example: Sakura focuses on lightning-elemental abilities, being the first ally in the game with Thundaja. This is a direct result of her having previously been Veritas of the Bolt.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue">Lunar: Eternal Blue</a></em>, Lucia's character is a major example of gameplay and story integration:
<ul><li> Lucia's development of human emotions happens concurrently with her developing new tactics in battle. For example, after a plot point wherein she returns to Hiro because she misses him (though she doesn't understand that), she begins casting healing and protective spells on other characters, favoring Hiro, in fact. Prior to this plot point, she would only cast these spells on herself.
</li><li> When you first get her, she's, well, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, with absurd stats and the ability to solo any group in the dungeon you find her in within a single turn. Once she's injured by Zophar, however, her stats are reduced to nearly nothing and she spends the game recovering, even in battle.
</li><li> And then there's her mana supply - or rather, the "lack" of it. Lucia is a pure spellcaster, and doesn't possess a physical attack—at the worst she'll chain-cast a single-target damage spell on an enemy. However, her MP supply reads "null", just like any pure physical-damage warrior. And then you realize... oh yeah, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, <em>her mana supply is</em> <em><strong>infinite</strong></em>.

If you attack trees at night, you can find bird Pokémon normally only found in the daytime... but already Asleep.

</li><li> When you capture a weakened Pokémon, its HP will be exactly as it was before it was caught. While this is nothing new since <em>Red and Blue</em> did it first, the captured Pokémon's PP for its moves will also be already spent based on how much it used their moves.

<ul><li> The games make it mandatory to catch your version's mascot to move the plot along. The pre-battle dialog says it's testing you, but <em>wants</em> to be caught; accordingly, it's <em>fifteen times</em> easier to capture than a normal legendary. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7evy2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7evy2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7evy2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most legendaries have historically had capture numbers of 3, which at full health with a normal Poké Ball, would translate to less than half of a one-percent chance to catch them.

Most of the time, these hordes will be a single species, but there are a few exceptions:
<ul><li> Zangoose and Seviper will occasionally show up in the same horde battle on Route 8. These species of Pokémon are <em>sworn enemies</em>, and therefore will try to attack each other before they try to attack you.
</li><li> A similar example is on Route 18, where four Durant are accompanied by a Heatmor, their <em>predator</em>.
</li><li> Sometimes on Route 20 there are a group of Trevenant, walking trees, with a Sudowoodo, a Rock-type Pokémon that just <em>pretends</em> to be a tree.

<ul><li> Both Groudon and Kyogre change the weather. For <em>Alpha Sapphire</em>, the heavy rainfall in a way changes it to nighttime (if you played it in the daytime) with heavy rain, while <em>Omega Ruby</em>'s drought changes it to daytime (if you played at night), with the sky burning. The effect of both weather carries on in the overworld and battles until you defeat or catch either legendary.
</li><li> After capturing Kyogre, if you use it to Surf, random trainers won't battle you if you cross their line of sight, since they're intimidated by a trainer sailing around on a legendary Pokémon that nearly caused an extinction-level flood a short time ago.

Sometimes this results in Pokémon of the same species or evolutionary line appearing in battle to fight your Pokémon, but sometimes the call for help will attract a Pokémon that <em>preys</em> on the first Pokémon and will attack it instead, like Carbink and Sableye, or Mareanie and Corsola. Some belligerent and territorial Pokémon, like Stufful, will attack <em>each other</em> instead of your Pokémon. Baby Pokémon have a small chance of calling in a Happiny or Chansey and Cubone have a chance of calling in a Kangaskhan, both of whom are known for being motherly.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8uuzp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8uuzp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8uuzp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The latter example also has the bonus of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a>, since the original design had Marowak evolve into Kangaskhan, and Cubone still bears an extremely close resemblance to a baby Kangaskhan.</span>

</li><li> In general, no matter what level you are, any Pokémon you catch will always respect and obey you since you proved yourself by capturing it. Pokémon you receive in a trade will very likely disobey your orders in battle unless you have certain badges. In a lore building sense, traded Pokémon would be wary of you and don't trust you since they were basically given away to a stranger. The badges are proof that you are a strong Trainer, thus the traded Pokémon will respect you. From a gameplay perspective, traded Pokémon disobeying players is a way to prevent them from cheesing the game early on by stomping everything with a high level Pokémon until they get the appropriate badges for their level.

<ul><li> The Monado gives Shulk visions of the future. Throughout the game's story, Shulk uses these visions to try and avert disaster. This translates into a gameplay mechanic, as well: during battle, Shulk can have visions of an enemy inflicting catastrophic damage on himself or one of his allies. He is given several seconds to avert this possible future, either by redirecting the enemy's aggro, healing and buffing his teammates, inflicting status ailments on the enemy that can lessen the damage or stall the enemy, or kill the enemy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> outright.
</li><li> The Monado is meant in-story to not be able to harm biologic, sentient life.

</li><li> The player can make characters give each other collectables as gifts, in order to increase their affinity. The affinity can be raised or diminished based on how much the character that receives the gift likes it, and the gifts logic actually follows the character's personality as written. For example, Dunban hates fruits (which he voices several times) and Sharla loves them, so giving fruits to Dunban will make the player gain little or lose affinity while giving them to Sharla will increase it.

</li><li> In the Spirit Crucible Elpys, there's a field permeating the place that interferes with ether particles, which the Blades rely on for their abilities. The various Blade characters are depicted as being exhausted and in pain while in the area. Accordingly, the player's Blades will be significantly weakened during battle while in the Crucible, unable to access anything beyond their basic Arts. However, Poppi is a unique artificial Blade, and is powered by an internal Ether Furnace, rather than relying on ether from the environment.

Skells are expensive and valuable pieces of technology, and the loss of even one can be a harsh blow to BLADE's efforts to colonize Mira. Before you are allowed to step into the cockpit of one, you have to prove to BLADE that you are worthy of using them. As such, you are only allowed to take control of one after a certain point in the story (approximately halfway through), and even then, only after passing a test which can only be undertaken when BLADE's senior staff determines you're ready to do so. And to drive the point of how expensive these robots are home, if your Skell is destroyed in battle? You are paying for the repairs, and they are extremely costly (insurance is available, but limited).

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> fangame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouhouMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouhouMother">Touhou Mother</a></em>, Yuuka is described as hating high speeds. During a cutscene, you have to fly very fast to reach a certain location, and during the trip, Yuuka is described to have taken "mortal damage". Sure enough, if you check your stats after the cutscene ends, Yuuka will have just 1 HP remaining. Her speed stat is also consistently at 1, and there is no way to improve it; conversely, she often arrives late in cutscenes.
</li><li> In Kumatora's introductory cutscene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em>, she uses a PSI attack to fend off some enemies. If you check her stats after she has joined the party, you can see that the corresponding PP has been deducted from her totals.
<ul><li> The "mortal damage" system allows a character to continue acting after receiving damage that would reduce their HP to zero until their HP rolls all of the way down (or they're healed). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the Masked Man (Claus) performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, the prompt "Claus took mortal damage!" appears, and Claus is able to stagger to and embrace Lucas, speaking one last farewell before dying.</span>

Although you only learn your Chaos Frame standing at the end of the game, it determines which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching">story branches</a> are open to you at any time, which characters join your army, and ultimately which one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a> you get.

Just like in the book, Ron's wand is damaged and will occasionally backfire. (And in the few occasions where he fights alongside you before his wand is damaged, it won't backfire.) Professor Lockhart knows every spell your 12-year-old protagonists could have access to because despite being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage">Inept Mage</a> he is still an <em>adult</em> — but can't cast any of them because you've confiscated his wand. Similarly, Harry cannot use his spells during the final battle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII">Breath of Fire II</a></em>, Katt/Rinpoo is often described as fairly stupid (and hotheaded), particularly compared to pretty much everyone else in the cast. This is reflected in her having the lowest Wisdom stat of all the playable characters - and, by proxy, the lowest natural AP count by a fairly large margin, yet she learns several high-end spells once leveled high enough...that she can't cast normally due to her low AP. In fact, the only ways to up her AP enough to cast at least ONE of her spells is to either recruit a character into your town to raise it for her, and/or fuse her with the proper Shaman combination for a temporary boost. On top of that, the three spells she learns are fairly high-level and powerful. She didn't bother with the smaller stuff she might actually be able to utilize. She went right into wanting to do the high-damage, hurty spells without realizing it might take a lot of smarts and concentration to be able to USE them effectively.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario64">Paper Mario</a></em> game, the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss">Recurring Boss</a>, Jr. Troopa, is so dead-set on defeating Mario that, when you travel to a far-off island, he swims across the entire ocean <em>twice</em> just to reach you (he missed the boat so that's once to reach the island, and a round trip without him resting at all once Jr. Troopa realizes Mario's already left before he made it). When he finally catches up with you, he reveals his brand-new upgrades that make him one of the best defended enemies in the game... except that he's so exhausted from his swimming, his HP plummets to a fairly low number. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Something that he's quite shocked to find out, actually.</a>

You'll have to find a robotic replacement in order to regain that power.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Opoona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Opoona">Opoona</a>,</em> there are a specialized group of people, the Rangers, whose job it is to fight against the monsters in the overworld, and the titular Opoona is recruited into them. The monsters outside of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown">First Town</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">the weakest in the game</a> because said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown">First Town</a> is the place where new Rangers are trained—naturally, they'd be trained in a place where the local monsters are fairly weak before moving into places with tougher quarry. The monsters get more difficult as the game goes on because later locations are explicitly much closer to the dark half of the planet, where monsters are spawned from. Later in the game, you find yourself with a level 1 character yet again, but in a different part of the world. However, the monsters there are <em>also</em> conveniently weak because said place is the home of a person with <em>huge</em> amounts of holy power, as well as many sacred fairies and spirits. They've <em>already</em> driven out all the stronger monsters.
</li><li> In the PSP version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>, the game introduces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> between the human party members which gives extra power to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Mons</a> based on how well they get along, which often reflects on their own personal issues (Yamato can raise his rank with Sora by stating that he cooks at home instead of his mother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">which reflects her own perceived issues with her own mother</a>) or just being nice with each other (Jou can easily raise his rank with the others during an early episode). Everyone starts at Rank 1, except Yamato and Takeru who start at Rank 3 due to being brothers.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastScenario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastScenario">Last Scenario</a></em> has the dungeon where Helio kidnaps Hilbert's sister Joanna and then manages to capture Hilbert, Matilda and Thorve as well. Hilbert attempts to fight Helio with none of his equipment; scanning him at this point will reveal he has a very high (for this point in the game) 3000 HP. Later on, Joanna sets a trap for Helio that drops rocks on him, and the party fights him for real this time; his stats are the same, but he starts the fight with just 900 HP.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel">The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel</a></em>, you have Link levels that progress the more the characters fight together that provides gameplay benefits. For characters who join your party that aren't a part of the original nine characters, they have higher Link levels with characters who they have pre-established relationships with. For example, when you get Millium, she has more Link points with the characters who joined you when you went to the Nord Highlands, where you first met her. Another example is when Angelica temporarily joins your party, she has a Level 5 link level at the start with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crow, because they're close friends from the trial run of Class VII</span>. This continues to be the case in the second game, with examples such as Rean and Elise, who are adoptive siblings, and Millium and Claire, who are fellow Ironbloods. The third game avoids this entirely, and treats Link levels and bond levels as different things. For instance, the field exercise in the Sutherland province has Claire join as a party member for a short time, and it's mentioned how everyone in the party except Kurt knows her. Despite having no connection to her, Kurt's link level with Claire is the same as everyone else's when she joins.

<ul><li> Player characters, aka <em>Milletians</em>, are presented as spirits from outside the game world, who are temporarily incarnated within it. Because they are not normally part of the world, they do not "die", but simply lose the body they were using, which can be restored by a particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPC</a>. NPCs are aware of your status, and will casually mention it from time to time. This is actually made a significant story point for Elf and Giant characters.
</li><li> In the semi-prequel <em>Vindictus</em>, the fact that the Giant Polar Bear is such a popular target is referenced in a quest, where it is suddenly attacking more areas than before and you are the prime suspect because you bother, I.E. use it to grind, so much, and are thus demanded to either calm it down or prove that you weren't the one that caused it to get angrier. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You weren't the one who made it mad.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>:
<ul><li> Enforced with the game's relaunch as <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, as well as the story content in 1.0 leading to the game's original closure: in the waning days of 1.0's service, a conspicuous red dot of light could be seen in night sky, which grew larger over time until it was revealed to be the moon of Dalamud, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">which was descending towards Eorzea</a>. Over the following days, story quests were added revolving around attempts to stop Dalamud's descent, and contain the chaos erupting as a result of its imminent impact. In the end, the heroes' efforts amount to naught, as Dalamud approaches Eorzea, unleashing Bahamut and bringing the realm to the brink of oblivion, with one of the heroes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture">sending the player characters into the future.</a> When <em>A Realm Reborn</em> launched, five years had passed since Bahamut's rampage, and the realm had recovered, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">yet irrevocably changed</a>, while player characters returning from 1.0 would see changes to the story to account for their presence during the previous version's events.
</li><li> Linkshells are devices that allow people to communicate over long distances, basically like having a cell phone. In gameplay, these function as basically chatrooms for other people with the same linkshell to talk in, but you also receive a linkshell in the story from Minfillia when you join the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, and at multiple points she or others will contact you over them, not to mention various other characters who also speak to one another using linkshells. The animations for using them in cutscenes also take into account that not all of the playable races have their ears in the same relative position on their head as a regular human - Miqo'te and Viera will reach noticeably higher up to place the linkshells nearer to their raised cat and rabbit ears.
</li><li> NPCs will, generally, remember you if you've interacted with them before. This can be as minor as the leaders of the city's adventurer's guild remembering you if you started in that city when you visit them for other quests, to as major as class and job trainers acknowledging your membership if you go there on quest-related business not related to the guild itself. Even the one-off holiday events show signs of the latter. Yugiri in the main story will even change her dialogue accordingly if you're a Ninja when you meet up with her again ("You should train to be a Ninja" to "You fight like one of us, I'm proud of you".)
</li><li> Members of the Garlean Empire are biologically incapable of casting magic, therefore the only casters you find in Garlean strongholds tend to be Lalafell or Highlander humans (who were drafted after their countries were conquered) and tend to be low ranked at that, or use shock-sticks, in which case they can only cast thunder and paralyze. In story quests where you're fighting alongside Cid, a Garlean who defected to Eorzia, instead of using a cure spell on you like most NPCs in the same type of story battle, he'll use a powerful Aqua Vitae potion that accomplishes the same effect.
</li><li> The Echo is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeature">Anti-Frustration Feature</a> buff that boosts your maximum HP, attack power, and healing potency so that you can clear a battle if you're struggling with it. In lore, the Echo is granted to a select few whose abilities differ from person to person. In the player's case, their Echo grants them ungodly strength and makes them immune to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">tempered by a Primal</a>. During the <em>Heavensward</em> main story, you come across <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Warriors of Darkness</span> and they also possess the Echo. Just like the player, defeating the group has their Echo kick in and makes them stronger in the exact same way as the player.
</li><li> Normally, the game does not take into account on what the player's job or class is when a cutscene occurs. In <em>Stormblood</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Y'shtola</span> is gravely wounded and an NPC asks you to help her out. Normally, she would ask you to hold the person down as she heals them. If you are a healer, she asks you to help her heal.
</li><li> Why are players only able to teleport to other aetherytes? Because it's <em>dangerous</em> to do otherwise! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As shown at the end of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> and later in <em>Heavensward</em>, there is a spell known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Flow</a>" that allows one to, in theory, teleport anywhere in the world by delving directly into the Lifestream. Unfortunately, returning from the Lifestream is nearly impossible to do, and even if you manage it, your body and aether will suffer for it. Thancred managed to return from the Lifestream on his own, but wound up being completely incapable of using magic afterwards. Y'shtola wasn't as fortunate: she was only able to return from the Lifestream with aid, but wound up losing her sight. Although she can still "see" the aether of others, doing so greatly taxes her and shortens her lifespan.</span>
<ul><li> Thancred's loss of magic power also plays a role in <em>Shadowbringers</em> where he's a Gunbreaker. Several of the Gunbreaker's abilities involve the use of aether and Thancred can't use said abilities since he can't manipulate his aether. Ryne shows that she infuses Thancred's cartridges with her own aether, which allows him to perform his job to the fullest. This stipulation also affects Thancred's performance as a Trust NPC in dungeons, where Thancred can't use all of his abilities unless Ryne is also in the party.
</li></ul></li><li> Each of the casters have a different way of managing their MP that suits the job's lore;
<ul><li> White Mage draws on the land's energy to heal, but must be careful to prevent overhealing and using up the ambient aether and leaving them dry, much like how a White Mage needs to be conservative with their MP; casting a weaker Cure 1 over and over is far more beneficial than casting the much more expensive Cure II over a long drawn out fight, as spamming the latter will drain their MP dry quickly.
</li><li> Black Mages study the ebbing and flowing nature of the Astral and Umbral eras and apply it to their casting, burning out their MP in fire-aspect Astral stance and restoring it in chunks in the ice-aspected Umbral stance. They also don't start learning any spells with massive impact until becoming Black Mages proper, as high level Black Magic is exceptionally dangerous for Thaumaturges to try to use without a conduit, which their soul crystals act as.
</li><li> Summoner and Scholar are strategists who value strategy, planning, and caution, and as such they manage their mana through the one-minute cooldown Aetherflow buff which restores mana and enables strong abilities, and also keep most of their spells already drawn out with aether-imbued ink in their spellbooks to take the burden off their body's aether. Also, Summoner works on a twofold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a> with their summoned Egi; as such Arcanists can't learn other egi until killing their respective Primal (the issue of summoning Ifrit-egi is sidestepped, since you can't advance <em>any</em> class into a Job until you complete a quest which takes place shortly after fighting him in the story), making them the only job blocked from progressing their <em>A Realm Reborn</em> Job storyline by Main Story progression.
</li><li> Astrologian draws upon the infinite power of space and stars, and thus have some of the better mana conservation of the healer jobs. Their star-charting ability also allows them to see into the future, and as such many of their buffs and healing strategies in-lore and in gameplay play them to be preemptive healers ready to get a spellcast out before damage is done even though their kit is better served towards being a reactive healer like White Mage.
</li><li> Red Mages refuse to draw on the land's aether like White and Black Mages, due to their history as descending from mages who accidentally triggered the Sixth Umbral Calamity from overuse of the land's aether, and sidestepping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">Cast from Lifespan</a> issues brought up with White Mage by using focusing crystals to magnify their aether, allowing for small amounts to translate into larger and more powerful spells; this results in them having no unique way of restoring their own MP, having to rely on their party, ethers, or role actions. It's also explained that their spells work up-front, which translates to Red Mage's versions of the several elemental spells other casters get having long cast times but dealing their damage all at once, compared to others having the standard shorter or even instantaneous cast times but dealing damage over time.
</li><li> Dark Knight, despite being a tank, teaches about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">Cast from Lifespan</a> nature of tapping into the Darkness, and how they need to be careful with tapping in too deep, which translates to the Dark Knight's un-tank-like focus on MP, which is used up while in Darkside and running out of it heavily stunts their ability to fight and hold enmity.
</li><li> While also a tank, the Gunbreaker also uses magic (at least according to lore) by using aether-infused cartridges to produce magic effects from their gunblades. In practice, they gain aether for their abilities by attacking enemies and drawing a portion of their aether into their cartridges. As mentioned previously, this leaves Thancred unable to use all of his abilities as a gunbreaker unless he has someone to charge his cartridges for him.
</li></ul></li><li> Dark Knight itself, like the other classes introduced with the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion, caught some flak for the fact that you cannot play as it until you actually reach the expansion's content. But in a beautiful case of this that is a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>, the player's access to the Darkness is built on the events of the story up to that point, turning everything from the tragedy of the finale of the first story arc to the chronic cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">Dude, Where's My Respect?</a> from NPCs into the well from which the player can draw as a Dark Knight.
</li><li> Going to Novrandt in <em>Shadowbringers</em> involves crossing the void between worlds to an entirely different dimension. As such, you initially can't use retainer bells until The Crystal Exarch introduces you Feo Ul, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> who makes a pact with you that allows them to interact with your retainer on The Source by following your aether there. Even after you can access retainers again though, you always have to return to the Source to access the Aesthetician (the NPC who does haircuts and other minor recustomizations) because he only exists on Hydaelyn, and having Feo Ul, what with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> as a Pixie, try to cut your hair would probably end... poorly.
</li><li> In regards to <em>Shadowbringers</em>: when you first travel to Norvrandt, the sky is blanketed in brilliant, unnatural light and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessDaytime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessDaytime">Endless Daytime</a>. As you progress through the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and slay the Lightwardens</span>, areas of Norvrandt will see a return of their natural day-and-night cycle, which will persist permanently thereafter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(save for near the end of the MSQ, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a></span>).

The cutscene ends as the player character appears to be preparing to tell the child the tales of their exploits. Actually accessing it, likewise, is done by talking to a specific NPC, with the implication that you're retelling your adventures rather than literally replaying old content.</span>
</li><li> When fighting Alexander Prime, he will sometimes cause time to freeze, which also freezes the whole party in place. Players with any buffs or debuffs applied to them will have the timers on them freeze whenever Alexander stops time.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the Marauder storyline is a feral Aurochs known as Kujata. Part of the reason Kujata is so dangerous is because its victims are inexplicably <em>very</em> hard to heal and often die from their wounds while being treated. When the time comes to actually fight and kill it, you learn Kujata places the Infirmity debuff on you with every attack - which drastically reduces how effective healing magics are.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillScoresAndPerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillScoresAndPerks">Skill Scores and Perks</a>: Player characters gain their powers by being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSymbiote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSymbiote">symbiotically</a> bonded to a biomechanical construct from a past age known as a bee that gives them access to far more power than most people get on their own. Such powers include increased skill and greater skill gain in using magic, explaining why the characters are generally better than regular people at magic and how they can quickly grow far more powerful.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">Death Is a Slap on the Wrist</a>: The Bees, as they're called, are also immortal; if killed, they appear in the spirit world and can either revive their body or reconstitute it at a nearby anima well. It's so difficult to kill such a being that only a few enemies you ever encounter could even try it, and it takes so long that they find more creative ways to occupy your time while they work on accomplishing their goals.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoticeThis">Notice This</a>: Why are there honeycomb symbols that give the player access to snippets of lore about enemies, events, and places?

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusableEnemyEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusableEnemyEquipment">Unusable Enemy Equipment</a>: Why do you have to spend so much on weapons when you could just grab a dead enemy's gun?

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em> seems to build the premise of its vast story on integrating desired RPG gameplay conventions:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">Death Is a Slap on the Wrist</a>: a great deal of the plot revolves around around finding out why the main character comes back to life if killed. In addition, said character can gain an ability to resurrect other party members without using a spell, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because he has power to draw tormented souls to himself, and they all fit the bill</span>. Also, intentionally springing death traps and getting yourself killed repeatedly is required to solve one puzzle in the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which was built so only that person could solve it</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero">Amnesiac Hero</a>: the other great plot axis is recovering the nameless main character's lost memories and piecing back his identity. This also explains why the character can have such powerful unknown rivals and caches waiting specifically for him, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">starting as a weakling</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>: True to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> form, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignment</a> exists, and characters can discuss and sometimes sense it. It effects and is effected by both gameplay and story choices. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The character's previous incarnations are also divided by alignment, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a> are "What can change the nature of a man?"</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization">Character attributes</a>: all attributes effect both gameplay and story. Mental attributes emphasize opening more dialog and story choices and provide some gameplay benefits (experience point gain, learning spells, shop prices), while physical attributes mostly provide combat bonuses and have occasional effects on dialog options (such as physical threats and catching pickpockets in the act). Different dialog choices can also raise characters' attributes.
</li></ul></li><li> The blending of the gameplay and the story is a hugely fundamental aspect of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LISA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LISA">LISA</a>: The Painful</em>.
<ul><li> Joy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">Fantastic Drug</a> that can "make you feel nothing". It's also an item that can be used to give any character temporary, but ridiculously potent stat boosts. The downside is that anyone who has used Joy will get withdrawals if they don't take the drug frequently, which will make them practically useless outside of using magic attacks or support. To make things worse, Joy is a very scarce resource. Some party members, like Brad, Dick and Queen, come with Joy addiction and will have withdrawals regardless of whether you feed them Joy or not.
</li><li> Various events can directly affect Brad's playstyle as a character. Early on, he can get knocked out by an ambusher and lose some of his stats. Later, if he loses his limbs, his dial combos will change and he'll lose some of his skills; in addition, his stats will drop and he'll become more reliant on Joy.
</li><li> The clearest way to explain the presence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">grotesque mutated men</a> throughout Olathe is through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their item drops.</span>
</li><li> Every human enemy has a name and unique appearance, and the attacks and move they use reflect their personalities and their current status. Sugar Mountain doesn't take you seriously and will occasionally check his hair instead of paying attention. Trips Breezer refuses to fight you, and will only block your attacks, stall for time, and cry. This is everywhere throughout the game, but the most prominent example is the Rando Army, who grows gradually more terrified of Brad as the battle goes on and will waste turns shaking in fear. And their lieutenant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Clint Moss</a>, rather than getting scared of Brad, will get <em>enraged</em> and stand his ground  demonstrating his unyielding loyalty towards his boss despite their hopeless situation.
</li><li> Even Rando's moveset is relevant to his character. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He can use the Buster Punches  a move unique to Brad's custom martial arts style  hinting towards his own connection to Brad.</span>
</li><li> During the Rando Army battle, Brad suddenly develops new moves in the middle of the fight (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Scream and Cry</span>) and the music changes to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Soft Skin", the song that plays when you fight the mutants.</span> This is a direct foreshadow to the very end of the game.
</li><li> Fireballs are described as "a blast of flaming emotion", but are more representative of how much of an emotional wreck the caster in question is. Brad himself develops larger-scale fireballs as he levels up and wrestles with his demons. There is an exception to this rule  Percy  but he's using a lighter and hairspray instead of actually throwing fireballs.
</li><li> In the final area, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after Buddy rejects Brad,</span> his class changes from "Nobody" to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Failure"</span>, reflecting his mental state. Many of his physical moves will be replaced with fire-themed equivalents as well, reflecting the strength of his inner, raw emotion.
</li><li> Terry Hintz's basic attack involves him charging up at the enemy and pathetically tripping and flopping on the ground. At the beginning of the game, he says that he pulled his hamstring.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> are the gameplay manifestation of a plot ability that the main character is revealed to have—namely, to subtly manipulate people that they're close to. As a consequence, the more influence you have with a party member, the more their alignment mirrors your own and vice versa (with due consequences to bonuses/penalties to Light- and Dark-Sided Force powers). This veers into "story and story segregation" territory sometimes, since even if you turn a Light-Sided character to the Dark Side with your influence, they will still object to your Dark-Sided decisions and lose affection for you.
</li><li> The XP system, where you grow more powerful by killing enemies, is revealed to be the result of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main character's "rift in the force" growing more powerful by feeding on the destruction she causes.

Atton, the person who says it the most, is Force-sensitive.</span>
</li><li> Early in the game, Kreia loses a hand while fighting Darth Sion, leaving her incapable of equipping two-handed weapons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wielding</a> for the rest of the game, even if you had her take the perks needed for that. Similarly, Bao-Dur lost an entire arm in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a>, so he uses a prosthetic and can only equip a select few armor suits because of it.
</li><li> Battle Meditation is spelled out in the first game as a technique for increasing the skill and harmony of a military force, although in that game Bastila couldn't use it for squad-level combat like every fight you get into. If you learn it in the second game, where it's an available power, you can use it to support your chosen side in the final battle on Onderon.
</li><li> There is an option in-game to switch to first-person camera mode for any character you're controlling. For characters like the Exile, Handmaiden and Bao-Dur, this is just a basic camera swap. When you use it while playing as sightless characters Kreia or Visas, however, the camera becomes misty and blurred and people are signified by red or blue auras since both characters rely on The Force to "see." The droids likewise get unique views with scan lines and a heavy tint in whatever color their eye(s) glow in.

</li><li> NPCs sometimes recite unique dialogue depending on how much health you have left, or if you have a disease. For example:
</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"><em>"Those wounds you've incurred are nothing compared to what you'll receive if you continue to bother me!"</em>
</div><ul><li> You start off in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> without a class, but after you complete the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TutorialLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TutorialLevel">Tutorial Level</a>, one of your allies will guess your preferred class based on <em>how</em> you beat the tutorial (e.g whether you sneaked past the enemies or fought them, whether you used magic or weapons, etc.). Your class plays no further role in the story, but the NPC has unique lines for all of them. If you choose a class different but similar to his guess (e.g. a knight instead of a warrior), he'll comment that he wasn't far off, and if it's wildly different from his idea (e.g. a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">battlemage</a> instead of a thief), he'll be surprised and say that he'd never have guessed.

<ul><li> At the start of the game, you can't understand dragons. Later on, however, they appear to start speaking to you in English. This is actually because as a Dragonborn, you start learning words of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic">Draconic language</a> - which are, in gameplay terms, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">combat superpowers</a>, which also lets you understand what the dragons are saying.
</li><li> The Thalmor are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Nazi-esque</a> Altmeri <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> that nobody, absolutely <em>nobody</em> outside of the Altmeri cares for. If at any point you murder a Thalmor agent in cold blood, you'll just receive the 40 gold bounty for assault, instead of the massive 1000 gold bounty for murder. And if the territory is controlled by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Stormcloak rebellion</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">who really do not like the Thalmor</a>, you won't even get that. If you kill the Thalmor emissary in Markath in particular, who's being a massive headache to the local Thane, he'll even send you a thank you note with enough Septims that you can pay off the bounty and still profit from it.
</li><li> The game subtly implies, and if you threaten to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Paarthunax</a>, who outright says, that the Dragonborn - and therefore the player's - desire to kill everything hostile in sight and grow stronger for it, especially dragons, is just a manifestation of their Dragonborn soul desiring dominance, control, and being at the peak of their strength in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> way as the dragons themselves.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Similar to <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> gives you a few occasions where a sufficiently high Strength stat allows you to intimidate certain NPCs into submitting to your will. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> adds the Terrifying Presence perk, which gives you the option to frighten NPCs in dialog by reminding them how tough you are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> in general is a better example of this as your proficiency in a particular skill isn't just useful for its basic uses (e.g. science is primarily for hacking computers), but can be used to interact with the world at large (e.g. teaching people to synthesize drugs). This even even extends to perks. For example, having the Strong Back perk allows you to convince the Happy Trails caravan merchant that you can handle carrying larger load.
<ul><li> One of your companions, Boone, is a former NCR sniper and he hates the Legion above all else. Unlike all of the other companions, he will immediately fire upon seeing Legion troops, regardless of your reputation with them.
</li><li> One of the side quests involves taking the heads of certain targets. The head will be in their inventory like most loot, but transferring it to your inventory will have the body be violently decapitated.
</li><li> The game starts with you getting shot in the head (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTap">twice</a>) and surviving. You can later kill and loot the character that shot you, to find that his gun is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleUselessGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleUselessGun">piddly 9mm pistol</a>, albeit a heavily-customized one. True to the cutscene, it can't kill anyone else with two headshots while you're wielding it, either, no matter how many points into the relevant skill you invest.
</li></ul></li><li> A few examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>:
<ul><li> Institute Coursers are among the most feared adversaries in the Commonwealth: they're as humanlike in appearance as Gen 3 synths, and as strong and relentless as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">Terminator</a>. This bleeds into the gameplay, where your first encounter with an enemy Courser will be a tortuous battle unless you've leveled up enough and got the right gear for the job. In addition, a Courser who can join you as a companion, X6-88, has a whopping <strong>98 SPECIAL points</strong>, more than any other companion in the game.
</li><li> Speaking of X6-88: <strong>do not</strong>, under any circumstances, bring him to the Railroad's HQ if you want to stay on their good side. The Institute is trying to hunt them down, and bringing a Courser to their front step will make every member of the Railroad (including another potential companion, Deacon) <em>permanently</em> hostile towards you, as they rely on their secrecy to stay alive and you just revealed the location of their secret base to their worst enemy.
</li><li> Fast-travelling between the Institute and the rest of the Commonwealth will only take one minute in-game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since you're teleporting in and out of the Institute.</span>
</li><li> Paranoia concerning synths replacing friends and family is so strong that if settlers find out there is a synth in their midst, they will kill them on sight. Searching the victim's body afterwards will reveal synth components in the corpse.
</li><li> Justice, a unique variant of the Combat Shotgun that causes staggering, can be purchased in Covenant, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">requires only a short side-trip to reach after Concord</a>. Normally, legendary items available for purchase are too cost prohibitive for low level players, but for quest related reasons, the merchants in Covenant are selling at an incredible loss<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11d0b5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11d0b5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11d0b5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They're trying to attract visitors to screen as potential synths</span>, meaning you only need to scrape up about 1000-1500 caps to purchase it (depending on Charisma and perks.) As a bonus, it comes with several mods already in place that a low-level character will be unable to craft for some time, adding to its usefulness.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em>, your amulet starts vibrating when there are hidden monsters or magic sources nearby, to warn you of an imminent attack while exploring. However, when it suddenly starts vibrating next to your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestGiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestGiver">Quest Giver</a>, you know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousQuestGiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousQuestGiver">something is fishy</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And indeed, it turns out that your contact was killed and replaced by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> hiding under an illusion.</span> On another occasion, you make an actual <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching">Story Branching</a> decision</em> via gameplay: when fighting a Striga (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Princess Adda in relapse</span>), you can either kill it, like every other monster, or keep fighting it without dealing the final blow until sunrise (tracked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseGameClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseGameClock">In-Universe Game Clock</a>!) to lift its curse. Either resolution has a profound impact on the plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the very end of the trilogy, it's heavily implied that the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DialogueTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DialogueTree">Dialogue Trees</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a> exist because the whole series is being narrated by an elderly man to a child, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">thousands of years after Shepard saved the universe from the Reapers</a>. Because so much time has passed since war with the Reapers, "The Shepard" is now so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">Shrouded in Myth</a> that the specifics of their life—including their personality, appearance, and gender—are uncertain, and there are multiple conflicting stories about how their adventures <em>really</em> happened. Every time you replay the games and make different choices, you're playing through a different version of the story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, Shepard has a customizable appearance because he/she is resurrected by Cerberus in the first act and given facial reconstructive surgery to perfect their appearance after a seemingly fatal spaceship crash. During the obligatory "customize character" sequence, you're supposedly controlling the Cerberus operative saddled with the task of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">rebuilding Shepard's body</a>. Cleverly, Shepard's face is covered by a helmet during the prologue sequence before their death, so you never see what he/she <em>really</em> looked like before the surgery (if you skipped the first game, that is).
</li><li> While an Engineer Shepard solves most problems with the same blend of gunplay and powers that marks any other class, there are certain circumstances where this class is given a unique option stemming from their brainpower and technical skill - Engineers in <em>2</em> gain an increasing discount on research costs from their class-specific passive skill, since they have enough of a grasp on the science behind the things you're making to help Mordin design and build them without needing as much material, and in the Omega DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, they have the only class-specific interrupt in the franchise, allowing them to make a reactor dance to their tune rather than having to spend some time programming it to do what you want or sacrifice thousands of civilians to save a crime boss.
</li><li> How the gameplay treats kinetic barriers (shields) started as Integration but then became Segregation in later games. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita">The Codex</a> describes barriers as activating in response to fast moving objects, allowing them to block bullets and shrapnel but still allowing the user to sit and hold things. Unfortunately this meant that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> melee attacks and rachni's poison attacks became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a>, because, keeping to the lore, they bypass barriers entirely and do direct damage to health no matter how strong your barriers are. This proved such a loathed aspect that the combat overhaul for <em>2</em> changed barriers (and armor) to just another layer of health that all attacks effect largely the same, contradicting the lore but significantly reducing players' blood pressure.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> lives and breathes this trope: nearly everything, from your dialogue with Toriel at the beginning, to who you kill or spare in a run, to how many times you've completed the game and with which endings, to even how and when you reload a SAVE to undo something you did before, will be referenced at one point or another in the game. Certain characters, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sans and (especially) Flowey</span> are well aware of when a player reloads a SAVE, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Flowey ends up using this mechanic <em>against you</em> when you battle it.</span>
</li><li> Most characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> can take two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">specializations</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Sten</a> can only take one. Sten is Qunari - the culture he comes from upholds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> as a key virtue. He can't learn two specializations because doing so is, effectively, against his religion!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</a></em>, the money you receive from winning the bet with Prince Peasley in the second half of the game is actually added to your coin total. Unfortunately, due to the exchange rate between Mushroom Kingdom coins (what he bet you - kind of reasonable, since that's where Mario and Luigi are from) and Beanbean Kingdom coins (where the game takes place), your reward is about 1% of what you thought it would be.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium">Disco Elysium</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">the Detective</a>'s skills, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personifications</a> with their own voices in his head, will notice and point their equivalents in other characters he comes across.
<ul><li> Characters like the computer programmer, Soona, and the consulant, Trant Heidelstam, for example, show the downsides of having too much Interfacing and Encyclopedia, respectively, becoming obsessed by minutiae and indifferent to the actual people around them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquent">Cuno</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoryteller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoryteller">Idiot Doom Sprial</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> include a creative, artistic streak which the Detective's own Conceptualization can recognize.
</li><li> The Detective's partner, Kim Kitsuragi, has high Interfacing (he loves cool machines such as cars and cameras) and Volition (his calmness, self-control and common sense), as well as off-the-charts Authority (but which his high Volition keeps him from abusing) — and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">underneath it all</a>, high reserves of Motorics skills such as Hand/Eye Coordination (undercut by his nearsightedness) and Savoir Faire (his secret fondness for appearing "cool"). But he lacks imagination, which Conceptualization quickly picks up on; even if you lack Conceptualization or Inland Empire yourself, your way of communicating with your own skills shows the Detective are imaginative in a way Kim never has been, and which he can eventually come to admire about him. He also has terrible eyes, leaving him weak in Perception and Visual Calculus, and constantly misses physical clues and makes bad deductions based on appearances.

If the player takes the time to complete the VR Training missions and then aces the first level of the story mode, Snake's post-level dialogue is more favorable. Likewise, Psycho Mantis articulates how well (or how ineptly) the player has been doing up until just before his boss fight, and Colonel Volgin does something similar with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>'s medical history during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">"let's take a look at your body"</a> scene in the third game.

</li><li> The game's use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">Hello, [Insert Name Here]</a> is a plot point that's used to add another layer of metafictional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> into the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of the relationship between the player and the game.

</li><li> The boss fight against The Sorrow is full of details like this. The ghosts of every character you've killed up to this point reappear to take their revenge (and will typically offer some commentary on the specific method the player used to kill them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13bl3q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13bl3q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13bl3q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, kill a soldier on a mountaintop.

</li><li> Ocelot's AI during his boss fight is tailored to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">his in-story personality</a>. For reference, Ocelot at this time is an impossibly-skilled gunslinger to begin with, he just got the revolvers that he is naturally suited to use, and is totally reveling in his first fight with them. He slowly and elaborately reloads his guns <em>in the open</em> because he simply doesn't believe that he can be (seriously) harmed, and most of the time when he has a chance at hitting Snake with a straight shot, he'll disregard it in favor of a fancier ricochet shot instead since he's showing off.
</li><li> While Ocelot indeed can't be seriously harmed, if you inflict an injury on an exposed part of his body during the battle, he'll have a visible bandage over it in later scenes.
</li><li> Look carefully at the Ocelot soldiers' bodies right after their first run-in with Snake. Almost all the Ocelots have been knocked unconscious, but one soldier in particular has been tranquilized with a dart, just like in the preceding cutscene. Note as well that that's the only shot he took with his tranquilizer pistol, because - like the converted M9 from <em>MGS2</em> and <em>The Twin Snakes</em> - it's manually-operated, and he simply never gets the time to rack the slide during the ensuing scuffle.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotImmunity">Plot Immunity</a> might protect Ocelot, but <em>not</em> The End. He's still out in the open after a cutscene featuring he, The Boss, and Volgin, and if you're quick enough with the sniper rifle you can actually take him out. When you reach his area later in the game, it will instead be patrolled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">The Ocelot Unit</a>. You can also cause him to die of old age if you wait long enough between gameplay sessions after starting the battle, or just set the system clock forward long enough; The End is explicitly written as an elderly centenarian at the very end of his life, and The Boss even comments that he would probably have died already if he weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">determined to have one last battle</a>.
</li><li> The in-universe reason that this game has a stamina meter and the others don't is that Snake is still recovering from the beating he got from The Boss in the prologue. In said prologue Snake loses stamina far slower. And when Eva gets hurt she loses stamina even faster than Snake.

Their combo rate starts rising as the game goes on and the two grow closer, eventually capping at 99% near the end. <br/><br/>In an odd meta example Etna claims she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">hacked her title</a> so it says "Beauty Queen" instead of "Demon Lord". Titles are programmed in such a way that you can indeed make custom titles (rather than give a character another existing title) with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameShark">Cheating Device</a>. <br/><br/>The game has a feature called "Reincarnate to Atone for Sins", which will remove your felony records. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out Overlord Zenon did this, setting the plot in motion</span>.
</li><li> From <em>Disgaea 2</em> onwards, particular character traits often manifest as stat alterations. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Adell</a> gets a damage bonus against higher-level opponents and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys">Tink</a> gets +2 to movement (for running away, of course).
</li></ul></li><li> A mild, but <em>quite</em> clever example comes in the DS remakes of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games. So in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight">Shadow Dragon</a></em>, you have to sacrifice one of your units to disguise as Marth and distract powerful enemies who have come to kill him. This unit is removed from gameplay the same way anyone who dies normally does; and it's stated that the unit died at the end of the chapter, so everyone figured that they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has confirmed the fan theory that indeed, Frey is the canonical sacrifice due to his blue hair (making him mistakable for Marth at a distance), and how he was not in the original or even in the remake if one starts at Hard Mode. When the player gets the Aum staff much <em>much</em> later in the game, a lot of peoples' instinct was to use it to revive Frey, because he is the one unavoidable death in <em>Shadow Dragon</em>. Except that you can't, for some reason, despite that other units who died during the prologue can be resurrected. Yet the remake of <em>Fire Emblem III</em> on the DS shows Frey alive and well. And his dialogue with the player character states that he was indeed the sacrifice, but upon finding out that they were duped, his captors didn't kill him, they just beat him up and left him for dead and he was later rescued. So in actuality; you couldn't use the Aum staff to revive Frey, because Frey never actually <em>died</em> in the first place! For an added bonus in integration, it still mentions that Frey is dead in the credits (if the prologue was not skipped) but in actuality, it's just <em>assumed</em> he's dead because he hadn't been found yet.
<ul><li> Crossing over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">foresight from the developers</a>, the Aum staff is an important plot point. Only a princess is capable of using it. You actually get several princesses in your party over the course of the story, and if they are reclassed into a class that can use staves, they are able to use it. Even Minerva.
</li><li> Nyna is an NPC in the first game, and in Mystery (and New Mystery), is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a> within the final chapter. When you actually <em>do</em> get her, her stats and growths are abysmal. Actually, this makes perfect sense - For one, she is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">last member of her royal family</a>, (Ergo, you would <em>not</em> want her on the battlefield) and in <em>Shadow Dragon</em>, relied on Marth, Hardin, Minerva, and their allies to do the fighting for her - naturally, she's no fighter. It also fits that her stats are so terrible in a somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Woobieish</a> way for her character - her entire character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">things going wrong for her and her attempts to make things better only makes things worse</a> - so naturally, putting her into battle is just going to make things worse as she'll get killed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Ouch.</a>

True to form, this is mostly borne out in his stats: Leif starts out mediocre at best, and his overall combat potential is nothing to write home about, but his constant availability, ranged personal weapon, and massive support network makes him incredibly useful as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember">Support Party Member</a> who can always be counted on.
</li><li> It's noted a few times that Leif and his army do not have enough resources, and need to scavenge weapons to survive.

Leif gains a Leadership Star whenever a new tactician joins to advise him (and loses one if they leave), showing the growth of his skill.

Unsurprisingly, the sword he hands her is essentially designed to make killing him pitifully easy: it gives a massive boost to Magic, letting Olwen shrug off his Dire Thunder, is effective against horseback units, making it extremely likely to kill him in one hit, and even has Brave and Miracle effects, ensuring Olwen is likely to get in a second hit and dodge his counterattack.</span>

Most pivotally, Eyvel, if killed and raised as a Deadlord, is the only one of the Deadlords to change class—going from Swordmaster to Sniper. This is the last major clue that Eyvel is actually an amnesiac Brigid, another character from <em>Genealogy</em>, who was a Sniper.</span>

</li><li> Lowen is incredibly insecure and has very little faith in his own abilities, often comparing himself to the other knights in the army and stating that he'll never be as strong as them. On paper, when compared to the other three cavaliers the player meets before him, Lowen's stats come off as mediocre thanks to his unimpressive offensive numbers. While he does make up for this with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">high defenses</a> and is still a very competent unit, it's easy for players to overlook him because of how he compares to the others.

In game, Sacrifice also allows Micaiah to heal status effects. Whether or not she can do this for a character at full HP, though, she's never been shown using Sacrifice in this manner in the story, however.
</li><li> While earlier games in the series often have recruitable enemies suffer from what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">fans refer to as Matthis Syndrome</a> (they attack their friends/family/loved ones just like a normal enemy), <em>Radiant Dawn</em> thoroughly averts this. <a class="urllink" href="https://serenesforest.net/radiant-dawn/characters/non-attacking-units/">Various characters are programmed to never attack certain other characters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, for example Brom will never attack his daughter Meg and vice-versa. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential">Videogame Cruelty Potential</a> isn't an option either, move one of those characters next to another and <em>the 'Attack' option won't even appear in the menu.</em>

<ul><li> One part in the story features Elise or Takumi being stricken with a plot related illness. In the next map, you can't use them.
</li><li> A gameplay and plot point is that the descendants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">dragons</a> (namely you) can use Dragon Veins. If you fight a Nohr or Hoshido royal, they can use the vein against you as well. This carries over to the second generation - naturally, children of royal figures will have the ability to access Dragon Veins. This includes children of commoner fathers who married royalty.
</li><li> Personal skills in <em>general</em> are either tied to a unit's class and/or their character. For example, Ryoma the samurai has "Bushido" as his personal skill, whereas a former criminal Niles has "Kidnap" as his own skill. Gunter is your bodyguard figure, and his personal skill buffs him whenever he is fighting alongside the Avatar.
<ul><li> Hayato's personal skill is a double case: Its name, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>," refers to him being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>, while its effect, letting him deal extra damage to units higher-leveled than him, reflects his nature as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedCompetitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedCompetitor">Spirited Competitor</a>.
</li><li> Odin likes to name his weapons; therefore, his personal skill gives him a slight boost to his critical hit rate if he has a forged weapon with a long enough unique name.
</li><li> Effie's defining trait is her strength; her personal skill lets her deal more damage if her strength stat is higher than her enemy's.
</li><li> Similarly to Gunter, Felicia, Jakob, and Silas's personal skills all grant stat buffs specifically to the Avatar. The former two are also the Avatar's servants, while Silas was their best friend.
</li></ul></li><li> When one fights the royal siblings in <em>Conquest</em> or <em>Birthright</em>, their behavior and even their stats sometimes reflect their feelings towards the Avatar. Such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the eldest being reluctant to attack during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Boss</a> - Xander does so because he is committing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">Suicide by Cop</a>, whereas Ryoma is fighting with honor and flat out <em>allows</em> you to make the first move.

</li><li> In supports, Leo comments that he started out training with swords, but eventually switched to using magic instead in order to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">getting stuck in Xander's shadow</a>. He also tells Xander and Corrin in the first chapter that there are "more important things" than just relying on physical strength. Both of these are reflected in his base class and weapon levels: Dark Knights can use both swords and tomes, and Leo has a higher weapon rank in tomes than swords.
</li><li> Arthur's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> is that he has <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky">terrible</a></em> luck. This is reflected in his stats; his base stat for Luck is 1, and his growth rate for it is only 5-10% (depending on his class). Furthermore, his personal skill makes him more susceptible to critical hits.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, his son Percy is known for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Born Lucky</a>. Percy has <em>the highest</em> personal luck growth in the game (before factoring in inheritance from his mother, at least) at 75%, and his personal skill (called <em>Fortunate Son</em>) reduces the chances for Percy and any nearby allies to be on the receiving end of a critical hit.
</li></ul></li><li> In Shiro's supports with his father, Ryoma, he mentions that he chose to train in the naginata in hopes of defeating his father, who, primarily wields a sword. Since spears have an advantage over swords in the "weapon triangle" system, he's on to something.

<ul><li> The "Royal Sword" is usable only by royalty. Sure enough, only the Main Lord Alm is able to equip it.
</li><li> On Alm's conclusion of Act 4, Rudolf mentions that if he should fall, the others should lay down their arms and surrender. Sure enough, the defeat of Rudolf concludes the map. Additionally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rudolf will not attack Alm, because Alm is in fact his own son, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">wants Alm to kill him</a> as an act of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">Cruel Mercy</a></span>.
</li><li> Early in the game, Celica offers up a Golden Dagger as payment to Saber for his services. When Saber joins, he automatically has it equipped, taking it away from whoever had it.
</li><li> Enemies such as the Duma Faithful have zero points of Luck, representing their lack of Mila's blessings in favor of Duma's power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Berkut requests Duma's power, he also has zero Luck when battled.</span>
</li><li> Characters have preferences when it comes to provisions they enjoy and gain additional fatigue recovery from, and these preferences often tie into their backstories. For example, Silque enjoys "Rough" provisions like Mana Herbs and <em>Flour</em> because she taught herself to forage and eat anything during times of scarce food. Boey loves "Plain" food because his family were poor fishermen, so he is accustomed to eating simple things like Herring and Bread. Mae loves sweet food, and she starts out with a Sweet Cookie in her inventory. A list of these preferences can be found <a class="urllink" href="https://serenesforest.net/fire-emblem-echoes-shadows-valentia/characters/preferences/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Act 3 ends with Celica <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reassuming her identity and role as Princess Anthiese.</span> This translates into gameplay as an automatic class promotion. In a similar vein, the power that Halcyon grants Alm upon Celica's request is access to the Hero class promotion.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge">landslide and onslaught of dragons</a> in Alm's path requires story progression in Celica's path to overcome, because the one responsible for it is Jedah, the villain of her path.
</li><li> Clive's horrible Resistance stat becomes a plot point in the "Flight From the Ruins" DLC, where Clair investigates some old ruins to find a ring that can negate all magic. Also, Mathilda notes that Clair doesn't have much of a problem with magic. Sure enough, Clair has a significantly better Resistance base than Clive does.
</li><li> Faye is the only character in the game with a support bonus having a negative impact on her stats, being that if she is near Alm she has a reduced chance of avoiding an enemy attack. Faye has a huge crush on Alm, to the point of it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">severely damaging her mental health</a>. The implication is the decreased avoid chance effect is because she gets so distracted watching Alm that it allows an opening for the enemy to attack. That, or she's so focused on killing the enemy to impress Alm that she disregards her own safety.

In the case of the Blue Lions' resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a> Sylvain, however, you can immediately recruit him into your house if you're playing as a female Byleth.

This means that instead of the 4 Wanzer limit, you have 3 Wanzers and Ryogo on foot (which makes him a very squishy target). However, if you have bothered to download the sewer maps and use a certain image-enhancing software on that map at any time during the game before that mission, then the party figures out how to operate the elevators by themselves without putting Ryogo in harms way and thus, you can start the mission with 4 Wanzers as you usually do.

</li><li> If one picks the "B" path of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgreTheKnightOfLodis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgreTheKnightOfLodis">Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis</a></em>, a late-game cutscene will depict Alphonse being stabbed, and he is told "You won't die if you have it treated".

For example, Freesia starts out with one Potential called 'Desert Bred', marked by how she was raised and has lived in the desert areas for some time. After you learn a little more about her - that she's not used to living for anybody else and doesn't work well when people are counting on her - she gains the 'Under Pressure' Potential, cutting her defense and accuracy if she uses the last CP of your Phase.

If the aliens finish their scheme, it's a Game Over because XCOM has no hope of standing against them... but when you actually fight a few Avatars in the field over the course of the campaign, they're not actually that tough compared to other lategame enemies, and nowhere near as difficult as "boss" enemies such as the Alien Rulers and Chosen introduced in the <em>Alien Hunters</em> DLC and <em>War of the Chosen</em> expansion pack. But that's because XCOM has been spending the campaign blowing up Avatar Project facilities, stealing samples, hacking alien transmitters, and anything else that would sabotage the project.

<ul><li> When you take the shotgun from the corpse of the gun shop owner you'll find it's not fully loaded. Unlike every other weapon you pick up in the game that comes with full ammo, this one's missing one bullet from the one shot the man took trying in vain to defend himself from the zombies. Note that if you skip the shotgun here and find it later in the police station instead, that one <em>will</em> be fully loaded on pickup.
</li><li> If you encounter the zombified Brad Vickers he is one <em>tough</em> cookie, owing to the ballistic vest he's wearing that absorbs most of the damage from your bullets. If you knock him down and let him grab your ankle however, you can still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">kill him instantly</a> with a blow to the head just like any other zombie: body armor does jack to protect the head, after all. Likewise, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">shotgun blast to the head</a> will also do the trick. Zombie Brad's toughness in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake">Resident Evil 3 (Remake)</a></em> is retained, although you don't have a shotgun at that point to blow off his head with.

Jill's health is lowered and she has the "Parasite" status after the scene ends.

This is reflected in their particular combat style: the Preppies are among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">the toughest enemies in the game</a> because they're much more adept at dodging and blocking punches than all of the other cliques, and they're one of the few enemy types who can knock Jimmy to the ground with one punch.
<ul><li> More specifically: Bif Taylor (the tall Preppy with red hair) is depicted as the reigning champ at the boxing gym, and one mission revolves around challenging him for his title. Sure enough, the combat difficulty spikes appropriately whenever the player encounters Bif, and he's noticeably tougher in a fight than his friends.

</li><li> The game adds new features and aesthetics to complement the plot twist.

When they restart from the checkpoint, one of the main character's friends will be calling for his name and the main character will say that they were distracted, meaning that the whole ordeal with the player intentionally failing the mission was just the protagonist daydreaming. This can also be noted each time the player dies during free roam, which will result in the main character respawning while shaking his head, rubbing his face or washing his face in a nearby river, indicating he was only imagining things in his head all along.

<ul><li> The story ends with Batman flying off into the city while the game leaves you back at the island.

<ul><li> The core gameplay element in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Journey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Journey">Journey</a></em> is the flying scarf, with very simple rules: it's charged up by contact with other cloth, extended by finding glowing symbols, and shortened by getting hit by the Guardians. These rules work for most of the game, except in the very end, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you lose your entire scarf to icy wind, get it restored <em>and</em> maxed out by the Ancients, and lose it again, just as you reach the summit</span>. That, especially the maxing-out part, is a perfect example of gameplay and story integration, since the story mandates a dramatic change and the gameplay rules are bent to allow it in a spectacular manner. On the other hand, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">White Robe</span> has no justification in the plot and seems to have been mainly added for gameplay reasons, being a mild case of gameplay and story segregation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Indivisible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Indivisible">Indivisible</a></em>: Alot.
<ul><li> Party members join and leave Ajna at different points in the story. Sometimes members like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thorani</span> are captured and unusable for the remainder of the level. A character suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath">Plotline Death</a> midway through the game making them entirely unavailable, also in that moment <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Baozhai, Nuna, Quadira, and Thorani</span> leave the party in a bad mood. Making them unusable until you recover them.
</li><li> Ajnas inner realm becomes more spacious and decorated as you progress through to game, symbolizing her growth as a character.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter">Iddhi meter</a> grows in size as Ajna becomes more powerful. First she actually gains the bar starting out with one. It snaps to three and five bars when she is being attacked by Ravannavar and Kala respectively. In both instances she also becomes more in touch with her Haruka form and gains more mobility. The last instance she simply attains 7 bars since her transformation into her divine form is less violent and more of a moral revelation.
</li><li> Ajnas attack pattern in combat changes as she gains new weapons and traversal abilities. Her punches are gradually replaced with bow and arrow, an axe, and spear with different properties. Her Iddhi attacks also change from simple fist beatings into her transforming to crash into her opponent or fire energy beams. Encouraging the player to experiment and learn new combos.
</li><li> The start of the game has Indr teaching Ajna how to protect herself. Throwing you into your first "Battle" as Ajna where the game teaches you how to perform a clean block. Before the final boss Ajna has a flashback to her lesson with Indr, being able to clean block is vital to beating the boss.
</li><li> Ajna's aura chances from multi colored to red, then white as her transformation state evolves.
</li><li> In the Iron Kingdom Kampan passes through a gap in a wall off camera. Ajna immediately vaults into said hole using a spear before Dhar can theorizing how she did it, unlocking the Kampan corkscrew which can be used to access similar roadblocks.
</li><li> Ajna power is augmented by her bonds with her party members. During the final boss <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ajna permanently severes ties with them,</span> meaning she becomes weaker. At this point you lose all of your stat bonuses, every new atttack and overworld traversal ability you had (Except for her Axe) as well as your Iddhi meter.
</li><li> Dhar and Ajna are stuck together accidentally early on after he led an assault on her village, burned it down to the ground, and personally murdered her father in front of her. Correspondingly, his heart level starts at -25. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note187zt5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note187zt5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note187zt5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Most party members join at 0 or higher, with only the assassin Ren, who Ajna finds intensely creepy and annoying, joining at -13</span> and increases over time as he starts to atone for his actions. Usually as you play, his heart level will have entered the positives by the time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he sacrifices himself to stop Ajna's rampage,</span> mirroring Ajna's attitude towards him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Just starting to view him as a valued friend, only for his life to be cut short.</span>
</li><li> Dhar can still be used in the two fights against Ravannavar. Despite Dhar still being loyal to him (Albiet disregarded) long before he makes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.

Actually, this makes perfect sense - Dr. X doesn't know who Jo is, and his goons have no reason to target you at all. Similarly, after she's caught on the second and third nights and escapes, she (offscreen) makes her way to her intended destination because the goons think she's caught, so they don't go after her, Presumably, her doing the task is enough time for the goons to realize that she escaped. The game also features a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle">skip to the destination</a> scenes, implying that Jo is indeed skateboarding but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> don't see her.
<ul><li> At the same time, the game plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime">Take Your Time</a> straight - it doesn't matter how many times Jo gets caught or how long she spends doing the tasks to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupons">Plot Coupons</a>, the bomb will never actually go off, nor will the situation at the sabotaged industrial plant get any worse.

However, if the plot calls for somebody to die, then they're going to die no matter what, even if they might otherwise have survived if you had full control.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> provides an interesting example. The combat system was clunky and un-intuitive even for its time; Players should expect to be hounded by a conspiracy between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> and their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">inability to control their minigun-loving party members.</a> Also, as a western RPG, the dialogue system and emergent weirdness are arguably the whole point of the game. Speaking of which, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Chosen One's</a> dialogue choices change the further south (Read: further in the main story) s/he goes.

This is despite her having various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> abilities when you start off with her in the first game. One could argue that she forgot them due to not having to use them in battle in the two years of peace since the first game ended. Rikku however also has to learn the Thief abilities from scratch too, despite apparently still being quite adventurous after Sin's defeat.
</li><li> In Chapter 3 when fiends are pouring out of the temples, the Gullwings suggest charging in exchange for helping get rid of them. Yet the player never gets any Gil for stopping the fiends.

<ul><li> Setting aside the scene where it cleaves a cliff face in two, never to display that kind of power again, there are two battles where the Masamune displays power that it was said to have in cutscenes and dialogue. In the battle against Magus, the sword, which was said to be one of the few weapons that would allow them to defeat Magus, bypasses Magus's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss">Barrier Change</a> trick <em>and</em> drops his magic defense stat. Later on, the team uses a red knife to drain Lavos' power out of the Mammon Machine. The red knife then turns into the Masamune. If you use the Masamune on the Mammon Machine when you fight it later, the sword bypasses its defense boost trick <em>and</em> heals Frog, by way of draining the energy from it, just like it did before. (The rest of Crono and Co's arsenal also tend to get some sort of justification for their stat boosts.)
</li><li> At one point in the game, the party is captured and stripped of all their equipment, being forced to stealth their way around until they recover their equipment and unable to even attack without weapons. Since Ayla <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">doesn't use any weapons anyway</a>, though, she can just punch her way through any enemy encounters if she's in your active party at the time.

Such as taking a break. Or <em>thinking</em> about taking a break. It's kinda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, though in that it's less that she takes a break, and more that she takes a break while she's ON THE CLOCK. Anyone who's worked retail can tell the difference. On the flip-side, Logy describes the cauldron process Escha uses for synthesizing items as inefficient compared to the methods in Central City. And, indeed, whereas it can take days to synthesize items using the cauldron, weapons or armor imbued by Logy always take only a day to complete, no matter how good they are. And the disassembler works immediately.
