<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Himeno Awayuki</a> was told that she "doesn't need to know" the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>, but forced the Leafe Knights to reveal it anyway — specifically, that their enemy is the previous Pretear, who turned evil because of her unrequited love for Hayate, and that Himeno herself may end up turning evil as well. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>. In the anime version, the consequences were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">even worse</a>.
</li><li> In the manga, her stepmother Natsue unleashes another one on Himeno: Himeno's late mother died because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">her frail body</a> couldn't handle the strain of pregnancy and childbirth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">In other words, Himeno unknowingly killed her own mother.</a>

About halfway through the series (or towards the end, in the anime), she finds out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's been working for Satan all along, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorMascot">Mentor Mascot</a> is a fallen angel who was in on the whole thing, and the two have been conspiring to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">break her</a>  in Satan's case, he's been doing it since she was an infant.</span>
</li><li> In the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, part of what inspires Aion's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> is the Awful Truth he found out about his origins <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(that is, that the demons are really aliens, and the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen">Hive Queen</a> was a human woman pregnant with twins (Chrono and Aion) before she was turned into a demon)</span>.

<ul><li> The reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist">why most of the villagers hate Naruto</a> is that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedInsideAPersonShapedCan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedInsideAPersonShapedCan">the can</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox</a> which killed many of them and destroyed a good part of the Leaf Village.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em> starts out as a fairly standard story about three teens who get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">Trapped in Another World</a> and tasked with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveThePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveThePrincess">rescuing a princess</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, the main characters were originally told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWasAGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWasAGame">what was going on was a game</a> to ensure they would fight in and against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">giant mecha</a>. The prospect of defeating the enemy was a lot easier when they didn't know doing so would <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDeath">kill them regardless of success</a></span>.

They were, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">told what failure meant</a>, though the general public was mostly out of the loop.

This essentially turns you into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lich">Lich</a></span>.
<ul><li> <em>Two</em> things, as of Episode 8. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The warning that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrozenFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrozenFace">Kyubey</a> gave the girls about needing to keep their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Gems</a> clean by charging them with Grief Seeds? If they don't regularly purify the corrupted gem and it darkens completely, it becomes a Grief Seed and then <em>explodes</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenJohnWasAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenJohnWasAZombie">transforming them into a Witch</a></span>. Just in case that wasn't horrifying enough, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this is apparently inevitable. Ultimately the gem <em>will</em> darken completely no matter what the girls do, and every magical girl is doomed to become one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> that she and others like her fight. And the only way to avoid this horrible fate? Die before it can happen</span>. This one was so awful that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in one timeline of Homura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>, it drove Mami, who survived in this timeline, to try to kill the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> to save them from becoming witches before turning her gun on herself, killing Kyouko and almost killing Homura before she was stopped by Madoka. And in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagiaRecordPuellaMagiMadokaMagicaSideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagiaRecordPuellaMagiMadokaMagicaSideStory">Magica Record</a></em> timeline, this knowledge causes Mami to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> by joining the Wings of Magius in the hopes of freeing all Magical Girls from their contract</span>.
<ul><li> And just to make things even <em>worse</em>? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Apart from witches created from former familiars that grew their own Grief Seeds after their parent witch was killed, every single witch that the magical girls have fought was once a magical girl herself. Every magical girl became a magical girl through making a contract with Kyubey</span>. This means that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kyubey creates witches, meaning that all the bad things that witches do to people and all the horrible things that magical girls have to go through to stop them are ultimately Kyubey's fault.

Intentions being the key word here, as Dumbledore puts this off until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">the fifth book</a> and only tells Harry then because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dumbledore's keeping the truth from Harry backfired rather badly, leading to Sirius's death. Dumbledore, to his credit, does at least acknowledge that this was pretty dumb.</span> This isn't the only instance, but probably the most significant as much of the plot revolves around adults trying to protect Harry from the awful truth.
</li><li> This also plays a rather large role in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">the third book</a>. First with Cornelius Fudge's insistence that no one tell Harry that Sirius Black is out to get them because it might scare him. Proving that not all adults are complete idiots, Mr. Weasley planned on telling Harry anyway, telling Harry to be careful and warns him not to go looking for Black. But he also falls into this trope by refusing to answer when Harry asks why would he be stupid enough to looking for someone who wants to kill him. Harry finds out anyway, but proves Mr. Weasley's fears correct because the Awful Truth in fact makes him want to kill Black. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, in this case, the Awful Truth isn't even the Truth at all because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Peter Pettigrew, not Sirius Black is responsible for his parents deaths and Sirius escaped Azkaban to kill Peter Pettigrew, not Harry</a>.</span>
</li><li> The Awful Truth is in fact so awful that Dumbledore only reveals it in fragments; first, at the end of <em>Order Of The Phoenix</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he tells 15-year old Harry <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllUpToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllUpToYou">he'll have to kill Voldemort personally.</a></em></span> Then, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em>, he tells Harry that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Voldemort is <em>immortal</em> unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">five random objects, each anywhere in the world,</a> are destroyed.</span> Finally, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></em>, Harry learns that he<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, <em>himself,</em> is actually the sixth object (yep, there is one bonus) that need to be destroyed. In other words, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneHasToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneHasToDie">he has to let Voldemort kill him</a></em>, or Voldemort will remain invincible. He gets better</span>, but as he <em>didn't know that</em>, it was still pretty Awful. This was all necessary for Dumbledore's plan to work. In the first place, he wasn't even sure that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry would survive, though he had guessed Harry might due to events in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>,</em> and as he himself has said, his guesses are usually right</span>. But even if he had hard evidence that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry would be able to survive</span>, he couldn't have told him, because if Harry didn't think <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was going to die, how could he sacrifice himself</span> for everyone in the castle?

<ul><li> Chaos is the prime example of the Awful Truth. The Inquisition is quite willing to sterilize and relocate anyone who <em>might</em> have learned about it to forced labor camps for the rest of their lives. If this isn't practical, the Inquisition will just kill everyone. This policy can be applied to entire worlds with billions of people on them, and is still considered the <em>humane</em> solution compared to what might happen otherwise.
</li><li> Speaking of Chaos: A very large part of the Imperial Creed (everything about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Emperor being a God</a>) was actually written by Lorgar, the Primarch who wanted to worship the Emperor (who'd made atheism the state religion and was very unhappy to learn of Lorgar's teachings) and was the first to fall to Chaos (when it was pointed out there were other gods all too happy to bestow blessings on their worshippers).
</li><li> Roboute Guilliman was one of the few surviving (sort of: he was trapped in stasis) Primarchs, later revived by the Eldar. Not only did he take some getting used to the craptastic state of the Imperium, he went to Terra to meet the Emperor where he realized the Master of Mankind saw him and his brother Primarchs as nothing more than a tool (as opposed to a son). Despite this, Guilliman does what he can to fight for the Emperor's ideals.
</li><li> The Tau's methods of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel">FTL Travel</a> are much slower than Imperials, leaving them blissfuly unaware of just how small their empire is, while the Imperium has trillions of people on billions of planets. They also have no knowledge of the Warp and so believe humans tales of daemons are just madness (to be fair, most Chaos followers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">Axe-Crazy</a>) or that daemons are yet another hostile alien to be removed in the name of the Greater Good. Commander Farsight discovered the Ethereals are hiding the Tau's relative weakness from the general population, but instead of rebelling, went into self-imposed exile along with his followers.
</li><li> One formerly Imperial planet was colonized millenia ago but has been forgotten about since, but the inhabitants believe the Emperor will one day return to them and lead them to a new golden age. Chaos troops take sadistic glee in kidnapping them and forcibly showing them just how insignificant and uncared about they are.

<ul><li> A recurring story is how the original elven homeland was destroyed by the Tevinter Imperium. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was not. A survivor of that time reveals that the elves destroyed themselves in a civil war. Tevinter just enslaved the survivors out of opportunism. The vallaslin? The markings Dalish elves wear as a mark of adulthood? Arlathan nobles put them on their slaves as tribute to the nobles' patron gods. Last, the elves say that their gods, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Mythal</a>, were imprisoned by Fen'Harel, the Dread Wolf. The truth is that Mythal and Fen'Harel were and remain good friends. Mythal was betrayed and murdered by someone else and her remains possessed Flemeth, who Mythal saw as a kindred spirit. <em>Trespasser</em> reveals that their "gods" were just a bunch of <em>very</em> powerful mages who let that power go to their heads and that <em>they</em> were the ones who killed Mythal because she tried to get them to stop abusing their power. Fen'Harel only sealed them away to stop the madness, and in the process stripped the entire elven race <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">of their magic</a>.</span>
</li><li> A major cause of the Mage-Templar War was Templars abusing mages, and their usage of the Rite of Tranquility (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">which turns mages into emotionless husks unable to use magic</a>) fueling the conflict. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">The Inquisitor</a> and Cassandra later learn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that the original Inquisition created the Rite and their successors, the Seekers of Truth, knew how to cure it for centuries but kept it secret all this time.</span>

When they finally figure it out on their own and demand an explanation from Auron about this, he simply responds, "Would that have stopped you?''
<ul><li> The less-obvious reasoning behind this masquerade is that Auron simply saying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Hey, killing Sin the traditional way just perpetuates the circle of violence"</span> wouldn't be enough to change anything, and would more likely result in the party <em>accepting</em> the situation. By only revealing certain key bits of information as the journey continued, Auron was able to direct them on the path he tried to take before: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the rejection of tradition and an attempt at a new world</span>. Almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> levels, when you think about it.
</li><li> Besides, indiscreet revelations of the Awful Truth behind Spira can backfire <em>spectacularly.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Look at what happened to Seymour</a>.
</li><li> He actually outright states that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jecht turned into Sin</span> very early on but it doesn't take because he doesn't explain the story behind it.

<div class="indent"><strong>Wakka</strong>: We weren't hiding it!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Lulu</strong>: It was just... too hard to say.
</div></li><li> Tidus in turn doesn't reveal the Awful Truth he learned at the Fayth Cluster to the rest of the party until right before the final battle: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that defeating their opponent Yu Yevon will make Tidus disappear, since Tidus is part of Yu Yevon's Summoning of Dream Zanarkand, and killing Yu Yevon will end the Summoning.</span>

Solid Snake has started to show indications of accelerated aging; by the time the game starts, he's going on his early 40's, and looks older than his parents (who should be over 80 by then). Otacon explains that it seems like a classic case of Werner's Syndrome, except the tests for the condition say that Snake doesn't have it. They speculate that it's because Snake isn't "normal," meaning that there must have been some fluke in the cloning process that created him, possibly exacerbated by the nanomachine-based artificial virus he was injected with to assassinate certain people by coming into contact with them. In fact, his brother Liquid even suggested as much, saying that the problem arises from the genetic sample that created them being taken when Big Boss was old himself, in his 50s. When Snake finally finds someone who can figure out what's going on, the truth is <em>much worse</em> than any of the speculation: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the premature aging is <em>natural,</em> it's an intentional alteration made during the cloning process to <em>give him an expiration date,</em> which means there is <em>no way to fix it</em> and he will die of old age within six months, probably before turning 42. Worse, the nano-virus in his blood is <em>being damaged</em> by Snake's aging, and unless he kills himself long before he dies "naturally," the virus will lose its ability to differentiate between the people it was coded to kill and the people it was not, meaning Snake will cause an <em>epidemic.</em></span> The second problem is solved <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> so Snake doesn't have to kill himself to stop the epidemic,</span> but the first problem is most assuredly not, and the only reason we don't watch <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Snake die on-screen</span> is because the ending fades to black instead of fast-forwarding six months.

The game is designed in such a way that you'll probably have killed several hundred Shades (it can feel like a lot more than that) by the endgame, and you don't really give it much thought. The main character eventually develops a psychotic fixation in killing them as a response to the tragedies that plague his life. Towards the very end of the game it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the shades are actually Gestalts, the remnants of the real humans who underwent a process to clone their bodies which were being dissolved due to a mysterious disease, and the people you thought were humans this whole time were just clones of them called Replicants; the main antagonist of the game, the Shadowlord, is actually the original Nier you played in the prologue, who wants the exact same thing you do.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> continues the tradition:
<ul><li> The setting's Awful Truth won't be much of a surprise to anyone who played the previous game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> between the Androids and Machines is entirely pointless; the Machines killed their alien creators long ago, while the humans the Androids are fighting for have been extinct since the time of <em>NieR</em>. The Machines are perpetuating the conflict by intentionally handicapping themselves so they'll never quite win and thus have no purpose to their existence, and the Androids have been keeping up the charade that there's a human colony on the moon by faking broadcasts from a "Council of Humanity" to cheer on the war effort and maintain morale. And to keep themselves from winning the fight, the Androids' current generation of YoRHa units are intended to lose the latest Machine-Android War, and their security systems have been designed with back doors for the Machines to exploit. Oh, and the YoRHa Androids were created from components taken from the Machines, making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from their mortal enemies. Learning this causes A2 to defect before the start of the game, and combined with 2B's death, causes 9S to go <em>way</em> off the deep end.</span>
</li><li> On a more personal level, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the protagonist androids' names isn't 2B, it's 2<strong>E</strong>, an executioner model designed to kill other YoRHa units... especially Scanner models like fellow protagonist 9S, who tend to be curious and learn things they aren't meant to, like the truth behind the Council of Humanity and YoRHa Command. In fact, 2B has killed 9S <em>several</em> times before the game starts, and been re-assigned as his handler after his memory gets scrubbed. This has been going on for long enough that 9S is aware of the truth on some level.</span>

<ul><li> An early quest has an expectant mother hiring you to go to a midwife to obtain a potion that will prevent her child from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoullessShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoullessShell">hollowborn</a> and her consequently being banished from Gilded Vale. When you get to the midwife, she points out that the potion does absolutely nothing. Nothing can prevent a child from being hollowborn, but she argues that as long as it makes the mother feel better then it's worth it. You have to choose whether the mother gets the potion or learns from you that it's all up to luck.
</li><li> Another quest has you searching for a missing boy, only you find out that he was murdered by pirates after he intervened during their attempted rape of a prostitute, and his body was dumped into the canal. You can inform her of Derrin's fate (she'll be crushed, but the word of his last act of heroism will soften the blow a bit), or you can lie and say the boy left on a ship for a new life elsewhere. In either case, you can then track down the killer and avenge his death.
</li><li> The villain of the whole game has dedicated his entire life <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and all his previous reincarnations, to (violently) silencing the truth about the gods; they are artificial intelligences powered by mortal souls, and before they existed, their creators discovered that the original gods were dead, gone, or just plain never existed.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, there are multiple cases of this:
<ul><li> Hank discovers that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dermott's sister, who Hank just had sex with, was really Dermott's MOTHER, and that Rusty was his dad. Yes, he had sex with his half-brother's mom.</span> Fortunately, Sphinx is right next door with the mindwipe machine! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hank cheats on it a bit by leaving himself a message saying he had sex, but leave out the Dermott's mom part. And makes a Total Recall joke at his own expense.</span>
</li><li> The identity of Hank and Dean's mom is strongly implied to be this.
</li><li> Hank and Dean themselves stumble into a lab full of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> clone-slugs of themselves suspended in vats</span> and drop in a catatonic blackout. Their dad manages to convince them they saw their Christmas presents of an army of robot slaves. In the prequel to Season 5,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it looks like Dean is catching on to what they really are.</span>
</li><li> Triana has a portal to an extradimensional realm in her bedroom closet, and gets repeatedly mindwiped by her father every time she forgets.
</li><li> Two-Ton 21 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is not really seeing 24's ghost, but is just hallucinating him out of grief and guilt.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Played for laughs and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "Brother's Little Helper". When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest">Special Guest</a> Mark McGwire admits that Bart was right and Major League Baseball <em>is</em> behind a conspiracy that is watching everyone, and they ask him why, he replies, "Do you want to know the terrifying truth, or do you want to see me sock a few dingers?" They choose the latter option.
</li><li> Used in-universe in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> to show Huey's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior">incredibly cynical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">view of life</a>. Huey tells Jasmine that the money under her pillow probably came from her parents, not the tooth fairy. When she wonders why her parents would lie to her about that, he explains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic">the world is full of awful truths</a>, no one gets anything for free, and parents lie to their kids all the time. Of course, Jasmine runs away in tears.
<div class="indent">"...and you know what else? Someday, you and everyone you know are gonna die."
</div><ul><li> Parodied in the very first episode with Huey's fantasy about telling white people "The Truth", that Jesus was black, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was the devil, and the goverment lies about 9/11. In his fantasy, this makes all the white people break down and riot. When he tries it in real life, they couldnt care less about the message, they're just bemused and mildly impressed that a kid could be so eloquent.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, Gem history seems to be about 60% things Pearl doesn't think Steven is ready to hear; naturally, as the viewpoint character, he ends up learning about them anyway. Most notably: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the monsters they're fighting are corrupted Gems, the other Gems they're likely to encounter are generally going to be villains, and the reason the Crystal Gems are on Earth is because they led a rebellion against the Homeworld Gems in order to prevent them from destroying the Earth to make more of their kind.</span>
<ul><li> The Crystal Gems get their own Awful Truth in Season 3: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their fellow Gem Bismuth had been bubbled by Rose Quartz for advocating shattering Gems to the point that she built a weapon for it</span>. Which eventually leads to the Awful Truth that breaks Steven: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose Quartz <em>had</em> shattered a Gem- Pink Diamond.</span>
</li><li> Season 5 reveals yet another Awful Truth that only Pearl knew: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose did not shatter Pink Diamond. She <em>was</em> Pink Diamond all along. Pink Diamond and Pearl faked her shattering so she could live a new life as Rose Quartz.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> episode "Frankie and Ellie Goes Missing" revolves around Jay and Margo's parents go missing at sea when their plane crashed (their pilot was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBetterWithPenguins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBetterWithPenguins">a penguin</a> and penguins cant fly). Though they're declared dead, Margo spends the episode searching for some sign of them, but make little progress, until Vlada, the owner of Jays favorite restuarant, inexplicably shows up with the black box from the plane. When Margo asks how the hell Vlada got ahold of it, he tells her a bizarre story about the box turning up in a bowl of boulliabaise made from fish from the South Pacific he served to Jay's friend Jeremy Hawke. When Jeremy complained about it, Vlada served him a bowl of water his mother was soaking her feet and stockings in. When a grossed out Margo asked why he told her that last part, Vlada said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseCreepy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseCreepy">"the true story would be too horrible for her to contemplate!</a> Enjoy!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> has this as the main reason for the existence of The Society Of the Blind Eye, a secret group (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">founded by Old Man McGucket before he went insane</span>) that erases the memories of the town residents so they can remain oblivious to supernatural events surrounding them, meaning they're the ones maintaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> surrounding the town. Problem is, repeated use of the Memory Eraser Gun leads to long-term mental issues, explaining the odd behavior of the citizens.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> earlier in season 5 when Mr. Peanutbutter had believed the old "sent to a nice farm" lie about <em>his parents</em>, because his older brother Captain Peanutbutter couldn't bring himself to tell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">Mr Peanutbutter</a> that they had died. He had to face this truth twice in the same day because grasping the truth about his mother made him realize that his father had also "gone to the farm".

<ul><li> On the Straight Dope forum, several members shared stories of how, when they were children, they'd been told that their mysteriously disappeared pets had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DogGotSentToAFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DogGotSentToAFarm">"sent to live on a farm."</a> Cue the inevitable post that went along these lines: "That's a coincidence, because when I was little, I had a dog that was sent to live on a farm.... oh ^#@$% I need to call my parents NOW."
</li><li> Quite possibly apocryphal: the school of Pythagoras was so shocked to discover that the square root of 2 is an irrational number (i.e. cannot be expressed as fractions) that they kept the knowledge a closely guarded secret, and people who leaked it were punished by death.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">It got worse for them.</a> The school in question had a philosophy based on rational numbers, and that everything in the world could be described via some sort of fraction. The golden ratio (1:1.6180339887....) was paramount to this philosophy, as being a mathematical symbol of beauty. Upon their discovery of the irrational numbers, and the fact that the existence of those numbers as a whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">directly violated the school's philosophy</a>, the school of Pythagoras learned that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute">the golden ratio they loved so much</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">was an irrational number as well.</a> It's hard to imagine a mathematical construct becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a>, but it certainly became one to them. The school of Pythagoras didn't take that information well, and at least one <a class="urllink" href="http://nrich.maths.org/2671">legend<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> got started of a man who decided to tell and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledToUpholdTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledToUpholdTheMasquerade">Killed to Uphold the Masquerade</a>
