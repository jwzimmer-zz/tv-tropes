(One reason you had so many was that in few families did all survive.) Nowadays it's more a comedy trope. It was also common for the siblings in older works to be all female, with their parents disappointed that they weren't getting the son they wanted no matter how often they tried. Depending how important they are to the work, expect the siblings to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation">varying and distinct personalities</a>.

<ul><li> Yukie Tezuka in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliveTheFinalEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliveTheFinalEvolution">Alive: The Final Evolution</a></em> was, for reasons that <em>weren't</em> her alien-possession superpower because she only got that a couple of years ago, at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyYouthfulMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyYouthfulMother">three times</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">older than she looked</a>, and a serial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">terrible mother</a>. She'd come along and dump a new kid on the half-grown-up ones every so often, but when she appears in the story she's turned into a good mother due to the influence of the alien parasite, and is living with what may just be one of her clutches, five 'children' ranging from nine to nineteen and having nothing in common with one another. These include a shy, bald martial artist with lightning powers, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Wild Child</a> speedster girl in Converse, and a hacker who smokes a lot.
<ul><li> According to an omake, some of her children were <em>balding</em> by the time the sylph <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bought the farm</span>. But that's an omake.
</li></ul></li><li> Barron from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers">Bakugan Battle Brawlers</a></em> certainly qualifies. He's eager to move out of his parents' house because there's no room left.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, Casca mentioned in her backstory that she was one of six siblings. When you look more deeply into it, her family's situation serves as a deconstruction, as she grew up very poor and her village often suffered from food shortage and death from starvation. As Casca herself mentioned that it was odd that no one in her family starved to death, it begs to question how much longer her family could have survived having to feed eight members, so this might have prompted her parents' decision into selling their youngest girl-child into servitude when a rich noble passes by their village. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, her parents' decision is also laced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a>, since it turned out that the noble didn't exactly want young Casca as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">a typical servant.</a></span>
</li><li> Jushiro Ukitake from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> is the eldest of eight children and uses his position as Captain of the 13th Division <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">to support all of them.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion">Castle Town Dandelion</a></em>, the king have 9 children.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACentaursLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACentaursLife">A Centaur's Life</a></em>, Manami Mitama's family just manages to qualify since she's the oldest of five daughters (three of them being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameSexTriplets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameSexTriplets">identical triplets</a>). Since her mother presumably passed away, she usually has her hands full looking after her four younger sisters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>: Mikoto Misaka started out as an only child, but in middle school found out that Academy City created over <em>20,000</em> clones of her, of which a little less than 10,000 survive (9,968 of the original batch, plus at least 3 more "special" clones). Her parents aren't aware of the clones' existence, but Mikoto has declared them all to be her sisters. The clones originally called her "the original", but after that declaration they refer to her in turn as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneeSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneeSama">elder sister</a>.
</li><li> If you extend this to half-siblings then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> counts. Eight of Lelouch's siblings have parts in the story from minor roles (Guinevere and Carline) to moderate (Odysseus and Clovis) to major (Nunnally, Euphemia, Cornelia and Schneizel). Lelouch was the 11th born and 17th in the line of succession at the time of his mother's death, so he had at least 10 elder siblings at that point, with the possibility of still more being born in the seven years between then and the start of the main story. The exact number of children fathered by Charles Zi Britannia on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight">108</a> wives is never stated, but since Nunnally, Lelouch's full blooded younger sibling, was 87th in line to the throne<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0oru0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0oru0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0oru0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Charles chose the order based on the children's personalities and ability to succeed him, and due to being blind and crippled Nunnally ranked pretty low, which makes the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charles himself made her blind and Nunnally winds up being the Empress at the very end of the series</span> doubly ironic</span>, he may have close to or over 100 children.
</li><li> The Wong-Chang-Lee brothers (and sister May) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaphneInTheBrilliantBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaphneInTheBrilliantBlue">Daphne in the Brilliant Blue</a></em> are all siblings by one Mother. "I am the son of our mother's 4th Husband..."
</li><li> Oz, the demon king of Hell in the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDemonOroron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDemonOroron">The Demon Ororon</a></em>, has seven sons, of whom only four are named: Othello, Oscar, Olga, and the titular Ororon.

Unfortunately, he and his younger sister Nezuko are now the only ones left alive after the rest of their family was killed by a demon.

<ul><li> Olivier Mira Armstrong is the eldest of five siblings; little brother Alex, fourth out of the five, is the only brother.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of the series, Ed and Winry are the parents of two children, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says they go on to have <em>several</em>.</span>

Chuukichi Nezu, the member of the family who's seen most often, is the second oldest.
</li><li> <em>Go! Go! Itsutsugo Land</em> is a rare case, as it centers on a family of quintuplets (3 boys and 2 girls).
</li><li> Ringo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HimeChenOtogiChikkuIdolLilpri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HimeChenOtogiChikkuIdolLilpri">Hime Chen Otogi Chikku Idol Lilpri</a></em> has seven younger identical brothers named, interestingly enough, after the days of the week. Coincidentally, Ringo is the one that transforms into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite">Snow White</a>.

</li><li> Even though Ueda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JapanInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JapanInc">Japan, Inc.</a></em> says he has eight siblings, seven of whom are sisters, we only directly meet him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a> High School</em>, Nao Okuda is the eldest of five. The last four are quadruplets. Sumire was not expecting this when she went to visit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> has the twelve Numbers, all of them are sisters (though only some of them are related biologically). Technically, Subaru and Ginga are also counted as well, since they are the prototypes.
<ul><li> The Nakajima family originally just had Subaru and Ginga as the only children.

All of them were Chosen, which is why he gets to ride an Internship Circuit out in the field rather than being kept to the palace and capital city.
<ul><li> In the <em>Collegium Chronicles</em>, Herald Jakyr's parents belonged to a religion that believed in having as many children as possible for the Glory of God. He tells Mags that his parents had so many children that half the time they called them by the wrong names, and that according to the brother he still talks to, they never even noticed when he was Chosen and left. Jakyr ends the conversation by saying that "Just because you can have a quiverful of youngsters, it doesn't mean you should. Or any."

<ul><li> May also be the case with Goldanna, a laundress encountered during Alistair's personal quest, who mentions that she has "five mouths to feed." It's unclear whether she means there are five children or if she's counting herself and/or her husband in that number.
</li></ul></li><li> The human Inquisitor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> is said to be the youngest child of the large Trevelyan family in Ostwick, in the Free Marches. How many siblings the character has is left up to the player, but the in-game profile suggests that this is the case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">though there may also be as few as three</a>.
</li><li> Advisor Josephine Montilyet just narrowly fits into this trope, being the eldest of five children. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7yyd3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7yyd3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7yyd3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Only three of her four siblings are named in the game itself; her official profile indicates the existence of another unnamed brother.</span>

<ul><li> Peter and Samantha Ottomas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2">The Sims 2</a>: Seasons</em> have three children and are expecting twins when first played. Peter's mother Dora, who lives with the family, has a lifetime want to have six grandchildren, challenging the player to add yet another baby to the family once the eldest (David) leaves home.
</li><li> The Best family from Starlight Shores in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3">The Sims 3</a>: Showtime</em> are expecting their fifth child, as are the MacDuff family from Moonlight Falls in <em>The Sims 3: Supernatural</em>.
</li><li> Brandi Broke in <em>The Sims 2</em> is pregnant with her third child, but upon giving birth to him, she'll roll a want to have 10 children! (The want panel even warns the player that they'll have to move out the older siblings as they reach adulthood to make room for the new babies - even assuming Brandi stays a single parent, she'll have to move out the three she already has at some point to clear the space for the <em>seven more</em> the player is directed to have.)
</li><li> The Curious family from <em>The Sims 2</em> probably has the most siblings in a single generation in the game, with four full siblings (Pascal, Lazlo, Vidcund and Jenny), and two half-sisters (Chloe and Lola).
</li><li> <em>The Sims 2</em> and <em>The Sims 3</em> both include lifetime wishes/wants that require this trope in order to achieve them: randomly rolled Lifetime Wishes in <em>2</em> can include things like "Marry Off 6 Children", while the "Surrounded by Family" Lifetime Want in <em>3</em> is achieved by raising 5 children from babies to teenagers. Both can look pretty tame, though, in comparison to a regular (but high-scoring) want from <em>The Sims 2</em> base game to "Have 10 Children"!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a> II</em> hard-caps rulers at ten legitimate living children at any one time, though there's no cap on bastards. It is common for a Muslim ruler to have multiple half-siblings (especially if his father has taken four fertile wives). Ditto for rulers whose religion allows them to take concubines. In the context of the game, this can lead to succession wars as the half-siblings can attempt to press their own claims on the throne.
</li><li> Yozakura of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura">Senran Kagura</a></em> is the eldest of twelve siblings, with one pair of twins and one set of triplets, and claims they were born across a span of nine years.

This is more startling when compared to his fellow Rito father, Teba, who only has one son.
</li><li> The angara race in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> have <em>large</em> families.

Several of them are quite shocked to learn that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Ryder</a> has only one sibling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a></em> has Alph in the third game, who will sometimes state in his notes he has <em>twelve older brothers, one older sister, and one younger brother!</em>
</li><li> This is common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LongLiveTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LongLiveTheQueen">Long Live the Queen</a></em>, since having an heir is considered mandatory for anyone in the nobility in order to avoid problems with succession. Nearly all of the characters have at least one sibling and some have many more; one noble is shown to have six children by two different fathers. The player character, Elodie, is one of the only characters in the entire game to not have any siblings at all, which is particularly unusual given that Elodie's title is obviously an important one.

She isn't entirely sure about the number, since every time she gets a new stepparent, they bring along several kids. Because Akane has such a large family, she has to work multiple part-time jobs (some of which are fairly questionable) to support the kids.

</li><li> It applies to a greater or lesser extent to many Catholics. In some places and contexts, it is still the case, though not to the extent it would have been a few generations earlier. Unlike the Protestant Quiverfull movement, however, most aren't deliberately having massive numbers of children — just taking the injunctions against artificial birth control and abortion seriously.
</li><li> Also applies more or less to many Muslims. The strict Salafi branch, in particular, equates abortion, even those not already developing into a fetus, as <em>murder</em>, and definitely encourages procreation.

</li><li> The English and British royals provide a number of notable examples:
<ul><li> It's not often remembered, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a> had eight legitimate children, though only three survived past infancy; in addition to their lone surviving daughter Mary I, he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineOfAragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineOfAragon">Catherine of Aragon</a> had four babies who were stillborn or died shortly after birth, and a fifth ("Little Prince Hal") who died from an unknown cause at the age of two months. After divorcing Catherine, he would then go on to father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Elizabeth I</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AnneBoleyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AnneBoleyn">Anne Boleyn</a> and Edward with Jane Seymour. Boleyn also had two relatively late miscarriages, and some historians count these as well, which brings the total to <em>ten</em>. In addition, Henry had one acknowledged illegitimate child (Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond), and may have had as many as six others that he did not formally acknowledge.
</li><li> Henry was himself one of many siblings. His parents, Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, had eight children, only half of whom - Arthur, Margaret, Henry, and Mary - survived childhood. Elizabeth, Edward, Edmund, and Katherine all died before the age of four.
<ul><li> It was a family trait, as Henry's mother Elizabeth (the daughter of Edward IV) was the eldest of ten legitimate children. Her father also acknowledged at least four illegitimate children.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover">George III</a> and his queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg had <em>fifteen</em> children, of whom all managed to reach their first birthday (a rarity in those days). Thirteen reached adulthood (one died a little short of his second birthday, and one died at the age of four), and six of those had surviving issue (although in at least one case,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12q26w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12q26w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12q26w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"At least one", because the legitimacy of the children of George III's fifth son Augustus is questionable</span> the only surviving issue was illegitimate).
</li><li> Speaking of which, one of George III's thirteen surviving children, his third son William Henry (who would take the throne as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover">William IV</a>) had this—but not with his legitimate wife and queen, Adelaide. As a third son, he had not originally been expected to inherit the throne, and so he took up a career as a naval officer. Being a third son, he also refused to marry some random foreign princess or some equally random daughter of a British Peer, and instead lived with his beloved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress">mistress</a>, the Irish actress Dorothea Jordan, for <em>twenty years</em>. William and Dorothea had ten children, who took the name FitzClarence (after his title as Duke of Clarence). (William only married Adelaide after becoming heir presumptive, at which point he had already separated from Dorothea.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> had nine children, <em>all</em> of whom survived childhood (which was quite impressive, even for royals with full access to the most advanced medicine).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13j2pn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13j2pn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13j2pn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While 19th-century medicine was fairly primitive by today's standards, the science available in the 1830s and 40s was leagues ahead of what had been available just fifty years earlier. Still, infant mortality was very high through the 19th century even for the wealthiest, so Victoria and Albert were <em>extremely</em> lucky not to have lost any of their children.</span> These children went on to marry just about every other monarch on the continent. She's not known as "the Grandmother of Europe" for nothing.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">Maria Theresa</a> had sixteen children (ten survived to adulthood), and so did her third son Leopold.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_I,_Duke_of_Orleans">Philippe Ier, duc d'Orléans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, only sibling of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a>, puts up a rather less impressive seven children from two marriages (including one stillborn and two that died in childhood), but what makes this impressive is (1) Massive Numbered Cousins—his surviving children, save one, had lots of kids, who went on to marry most of the Catholic royalty of the Continent, leading historians to call him "the grandfather of Europe" and (2) the fact that he was gay, and everyone knew he was gay (he managed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">flaming</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy">prissy in dress</a> in an era when men's fashion involved lace frills and rouge, though nobody dared cross him because he was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock">a tremendous badass</a>), but he still got over his probable distaste for it and actually managed to become "the grandfather of Europe." (As a royal, marrying and having children was required,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1436uk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1436uk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1436uk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Under other circumstances, he <em>might</em> have had the option of joining the Church, but this was not possible for Philippe. There were several reasons for this, but probably the most important was that he and Louis were the only surviving legitimate male-line descendants of Henry IV, so they both needed to have as many children—especially sons—as possible to secure the Bourbon succession and prevent a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> (if the line of Henry IV had died out in the 17th century, a strict reading of French Salic Law dictated that the crown would pass to the House of Courtenay—an impoverished cadet branch so distantly related to the monarchy that the Bourbons preferred to shift the succession to the House of Lorraine, which was more closely related but only in the female line. A succession dispute could have easily arisen if the nobility decided to make an issue of it and support the Courtenay claim).</span> but rather than simply do the minimum he could have gotten away with—having one or two children and not remarrying after his first wife died—he did his full duty and then some.) He definitely had more surviving legitimate children than his straight big brother (who had six legitimate children, but only one—Louis le Grand Dauphin—survived childhood).
</li><li> Par for the course in many Royal and Imperial families, as seen with the examples above, and there are far too many to list them all. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> beats them all in the long run, starting with his 8 sons and some daughters. These children lived to adulthood and many went on to have (varying numbers) of their own children. As a result, a great many in Western Europe can claim some genetic descent from Charles the Great. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15d68k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15d68k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15d68k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This, combined with his successful unification of much of Western Europe for the first time since Rome fell (he is listed as <strong>Charles I</strong> of France, Germany, and the Holy Roman Empire, and his descendants would go on to rule these realms), and the Carolingian Renaissance that would shape much of the culture of Europe during the Middle Ages, earned him the nickname <em>Pater Europae</em> ("The Father of Europe"). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a> would end up doing the same thing in Asia.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill">Mark Hamill</a> (also from a mid-century conservative Catholic family) is the fourth of seven children.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SufjanStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SufjanStevens">Sufjan Stevens</a> has five siblings, and large families occasionally feature in the plots of his songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahJessicaParker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahJessicaParker">Sarah Jessica Parker</a> has seven siblings, most of whom also have careers in the entertainment industry.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWahlberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a> is the youngest of nine children. His older brother Donnie from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewKidsOnTheBlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewKidsOnTheBlock">New Kids on the Block</a> is the eighth one.
</li><li> All of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewKidsOnTheBlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewKidsOnTheBlock">New Kids on the Block</a> members (save for Danny Wood) came from numerous families. Jonathan and Jordan were the fifth and sixth of six kids, respectively, whereas Joe was the "runt" among nine.
</li><li> The Jacksons. Joseph and Katherine Jackson had ten children (one died shortly after birth), including Michael and Janet (the respective eighth and tenth siblings). The fourth sibling, Jermaine, has seven children.
</li><li> The Osmond Family. The first generation had nine children, eight sons and one daughter. Some of them went on to play this trope to a T themselves: Tom has nine children, Alan has eight, Wayne has five, Merrill has six, Donny has five, and Marie has seven (two biological, five adopted). In total, George Osmond, the patriarch of the family, had 55 grandchildren and 48 great-grandchildren when he died in 2007. Not surprisingly, the family is Mormon (specifically the mainstream LDS Church, which repudiated polygamy in 1890).
</li><li> The Kardashians, counting their stepbrothers and half-sisters (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeInitials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeInitials">Theme Initials</a>), add up to ten siblings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MacaulayCulkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MacaulayCulkin">Macaulay</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KieranCulkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KieranCulkin">Kieran Culkin</a> have three brothers and two sisters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler">John Tyler</a>, President of the United States between 1841 and 1845 was the father of fifteen children from two marriages, the most for any President. Only one didn't survive into adulthood. His last child, a daughter, was born when Tyler was 70. His next-to-last son, born when Tyler was 63, also fathered children when he was over 70; thus, Tyler has one grandson still living (and another didn't pass until late September 2020). For an example of what this means, see this <a class="urllink" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=john+tyler+funny&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcpITEjvLfAhXHyoMKHWM-CKUQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1200&amp;bih=673#imgrc=5X8-Dzt5ctmT0M:">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Tyler's predecessor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison">William Henry Harrison</a> had 10 children, all from one marriage. Harrison's son John Scott Harrison in turn had 13 children from two marriages with ten from the second, including future President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminHarrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>.
</li><li> Historically, Pharaoh Ramses The Great had <strong>110 children</strong>. Obviously, this was through numerous women, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">three of his own daughters</a>. (Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">a sister</a>, but that was par for the course among the royal family.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> had twenty children, many of whom became successful composers or performers in the family tradition. Granted, he was married twice (although that doesn't affect things too much: his first wife Maria Barbara died young—just 35 years old—after giving him seven children, and his second wife Anna Magdalena gave him 13 children <em>and</em> found time to sing and to edit and compile his compositions, to boot), and several of them died in infancy, but still, it's a lot.
</li><li> Carlos Mencia is the 17th of 18 children.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDarwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDarwin">Charles Darwin</a> was the fifth of six children; his wife Emma was the youngest of seven. He himself went on to have nine children, two of whom died in infancy and one who died at the age of 10.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a> and his wife Jane fulfilled the bare minimum for this trope — they had five children, all of whom now work in the puppetry field.
</li><li> Another "bare minimum" case: Greek <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">NBA</a> superstar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GiannisAntetokounmpo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GiannisAntetokounmpo">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> is the third of five brothers.

That's <em>16 million people</em>, not counting other parts of the world where his genes have shown up.
</li><li> The real-life Georg von Trapp had Rupert, Agathe, Maria, Werner, Hedwig, Johanna, and Martina with his first wife Agathe. With his second wife Maria, he had three more children: Rosmarie, Eleonore, and Johannes.

</li><li> New Zealand NBA player Steven Adams is the youngest of his father's 18 children with five women.
