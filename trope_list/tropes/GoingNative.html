The Going Native trope plays to this fantasy by having a character lifted out of his typical environment and thrust into a new one, only to become a part of that new world. Characters who start as an imperialistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> with heavy prejudices against the native group are especially prone to Going Native. Not only do they embrace the people who were once alien, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">come to loathe</a> the familiar "civilization" to which they once belonged. Their loyalties change, and they will even fight for their new friends. As soon as they feel quite comfortable, possibly having fallen in love with a local girl and/or learned big lessons from a mentor figure, count on their old life to come messing with them. Optionally there might be an episode of being tempted back to their "evil old ways". Or they might just rise to the occasion as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey">Mighty Whitey</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is also what can happen to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRulingClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRulingClass">Foreign Ruling Class</a>: they could take more and more of their subjects' culture until becoming entirely assimilated.
</p><p>Going Native is not restricted to known traditional cultures. It might involve characters involved with aliens, orcs, mobsters ... you name it. Overlaps may occur with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Becoming the Mask</a>. Oddly, it is almost never used in cases where it is the audience's group being joined by a more advanced figure, such as the Fifth Column in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/V1983">V (1983)</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious">Not to say it never happens, of course.</a>
</p><p>Most real-life successful native-goers start out as extremely adaptable (e.g. Lawrence of Arabia). Dramatic requirements might call for the character to be <em>not</em> this adaptable to make the story of his transformation more interesting. If the character becomes more successful in his new culture than he could have ever been back home, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeADuckTakesToWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeADuckTakesToWater">Like a Duck Takes to Water</a>.

During military actions in (or the exploitation of) foreign countries it can easily lead to conflicts of interests and the mainstream paradigm of social sciences is to keep observation from an insider perspective and an outsider perspective clearly separate. For individuals finding a new community to call their home, it is simply a case of successful integration. Individuals that have become well integrated into local society have come to be highly valued as interpreters and mediators, as opposed to mere translators.

Several of his superiors said that Starfleet was deeply concerned by Ben's role as the Emissary and increasing assimilation into Bajoran culture, and said that they would have pulled him out if it wouldn't have totally ruined friendly relations with Bajor. Ultimately subverted in the three part pilot of Season 7, where we learn that Siskos mother was actually one of the wormhole alien Prophets, thereby making him partially a native of that region.

<ul><li> The pilot introduces Carlos the Scientist, who has just arrived in the titular town to study its many oddities. While Carlos is initially terrified by sky-high radiation levels, the decay of space-time, and a house that doesn't exist, one year into his residency in Night Vale he comes to terms with the strangeness. Six months after THAT, he's so nonchalant about a sudden suspension of the laws of gravity that he takes it as an opportunity to clean his gutters.

It should also be noted that Gavin's in-character skin is that <em>of</em> a Creeper. Minutes after they joke about him going native, they blow up anyway.
</li><li> The forum tale <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaleRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaleRising">Malê Rising</a></em> had several characters who underwent this:
<ul><li> Dietmar Kohler of Sud-Kivu was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilColonialist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilColonialist">ruthless German warlord</a> and carved a piece of the African Great Lakes for himself during the Great War. Before long, he grew to enjoy his new position and created a new state out of his conquests, keeping everyone in check through rewards and harsh punishments and marrying a <em>mestizo</em> Portuguese woman. After he died, his son declared himself king.
</li><li> After the Great War, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> princess Anastasia Romanvoa</span> was sent into exile along with her family to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eritrea. Unlike her sisters who married European princes to escape Africa, she became enamored with the continent and especially the neighboring Ethiopian Empire. After a long courtship period, she married the Ethiopian Prince Tewodros and became Empress beside him, though it did cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage">giant split</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">with her father</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">the exiled Tsar Alexander</a>.</span>

It is even more likely if they end up joining them permanently.
<ul><li> Agent Washington starts off very annoyed by the Reds and Blues constant bickering and immaturity, but after they save his life and he joins the Blues he slowly mellows out and regains bits of his dorky side from his Freelancer days. Some examples include invoking his authority as a (ex-)Freelancer to give Blue Team a higher kill count than Red Team, tricks Locus in a battle by holding his helmet up by his rifle, and being just as excited about building a water park during retirement as the others.
</li><li> Carolina starts off even more serious than Wash originally did, thinking of the Reds and Blues as useless idiots at best or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> at worst. After joining full time though, she is shown to have a sense of humor following their brief retirement in season 15. She tried to get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Grif</a></em> to teach her how to be lazy like him, joined a band with Grif, Tucker, and Caboose just to see them squirm at her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodToneDeaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodToneDeaf">horrible singing voice</a>, and she honestly thought the weirdest thing that happened during their retirement was Wash growing a beard. This also extends to her PSA appearances, such as embracing Grif's label of her being a 'Feminista', and going full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">Fangirl</a> over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TroyBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TroyBaker">Troy Baker</a> and his role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Revolver Ocelot</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> caused controversy among his supporters and commanders for his attempts to assimilate into Persian, Egyptian, and other cultures and traditions. In Egypt, he considered Amun, or Ammon as an aspect of Zeus, and fused the two deites as Zeus-Ammon and worshipped the same. In Persia, he started gaining Persian titles such as Baseilus ton Baseileon (King of Kings derived from the Persian Shahanshah) and he took this to the extent that he, offensive to the Macedonians and other Greeks, would promote Persian commanders on the basis of merits and insisted that in his Empire, Persians were subjects equal to Greeks and others.
</li><li> Alexander's Macedonian and Greek generals who carved up his empire into their own personal kingdoms when he died embraced the local customs to varying extents. One of the most notable being Ptolemy I Soter, who declared himself Pharaoh of Egypt.
</li><li> Among the many accusations made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Octavian</a>'s propaganda against his outlived-his-usefulness co-conspirator Mark Antony, the most effective was that Antony had "gone native" and was living like a Hellenist, an unforgivable crime to the proud and conservative Romans. The most damning thing, as far as the Romans were concerned, was the allegation that Antony had, on his own authority, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">held a triumphal march in Alexandria.</a> This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>, since triumphal marches were supposed to celebrate the glory of Rome and needed to be approved by the Senate. This would eventually trigger "The final civil war of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a>" and usher in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a> after Antony and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII">Cleopatra VII</a> were defeated and driven to suicide.
<ul><li> The Romans tried to Romanize many barbarian nations they subjugated, whereby they would take a few of the chieftains' sons as quasi-voluntary hostages, send them to Rome, and shower them with all the luxuries that the capital could offer. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajoredInWesternHypocrisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MajoredInWesternHypocrisy">being thoroughly schooled</a> in the might and comfort of the Empire, they were sent home as loyal client kings. This backfired however, when one of them, Arminius, revolted against the Romans, and led the Germanic Tribes to inflict one of the worst defeats on the Empire, at the Battle of Teutoberg Forest.
</li><li> Rome also encouraged this among tribes (even ones not yet conquered) who had useful military skills, particularly if those skills involved cavalry or archery (the Roman Legions were almost entirely infantry). Auxiliary soldiers recruited from such tribes would fight for Rome for 25 years, after which they and their children would become Roman citizens, with the expectation that they'd be thoroughly Romanized by that point. After a few examples of this backfiring with auxiliary units using what they'd learned of Roman tactics to stage revolts, the policy was modified so that auxiliaries would always be stationed far away from their home province to remove any such temptations (abolishing the auxiliaries altogether was impossible because they comprised a huge portion of Rome's fighting strength).
</li></ul></li><li> The French colonies in what are today Canada and the United States were an exercise in this, as the French were more interested in exploiting Native American trade goods than in agricultural settlement (unlike the English). Many white fur trappers adopted native customs of dress, residence, and even face-painting. It was no small number, either. Over half a million Métis - people with mixed European/First Nations ancestry - currently live in Canada.
<ul><li> Adults abducted by Native Americans in war might be raped, enslaved, or killed, but children were likely to be reared as members of the tribe and assimilated. A classic case is that of Cynthia Anne Parker whose white family was massacred at Parker's Fort and became the mother of famed Comanche war-chief Quanah Parker. Some well-treated abductees refused to leave their new tribes when their families found them, either from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> or because they really were happier in the tribe. (Cynthia was not at all happy about being "rescued", either; she tried to return to her Comanche family, but was re-captured by the Texas Rangers, and eventually died of influenza, completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">brokenhearted</a>).
</li><li> Starving settlers deserting to join better-fed Native communities was a major problem in many early North American settlements, before Europeans learned basic New World survival skills. The famous and not at all mysterious disappearance of the Roanoke Colony was almost certainly a case of all the settlers joining the native community on nearby Croatoan Island. But stories of an entire colony vanishing from the face of the Earth were less problematic for the financial backers of the colonies than having it been known that settlers could just quit when things turned out harsher than expected. There is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~molcgdrg/">a project<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> underway to demonstrate via DNA testing whether or not the settlers joined the local band.
</li><li> Intermarriage could also be voluntary. People might marry for a term, then separate or stay together. Sometimes an Indian girl would among the Anglos, then her Anglo husband would come back to the band with her. This intermarriage and cultural sharing was encouraged in some Plains nations because they believed the kids would inherit the best of both races. Mari Sandoz writes about this in her book <em>Crazy Horse, Strange Man of the Lakhota</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope seems to be endemic to any foreign invader who conquers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran">Iran</a>. In order: Alexander the Great went increasingly native and the Seleucid successor state was a Greco-Persian melange, the Muslim invasions ended with the House of Abassid going native, becoming Perso-Arabic and overthrowing the more Arab-supremacist Umayyad dynasty, the Seljuks and Khwarazmians went native and became Turko-Persian, the Ilkhanate went native and became Mongol-Persian, the Timurids went native and became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">Turko-Mongol-Persian</a>, and finally the Safavids, Afsharids and Qajar dynasties were all one flavour or another of Turkic originally and ended up assimilating into Persian culture. Bottom line, Iran got invaded a lot but two generations later you wouldn't have known that the ruling house were originally foreigners.
</li><li> Not to outdo Iran, but a lot of the Muslim kingdoms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a> also tended to established by assimilated foreign conquerors (mostly Turkic, but others also got their share). The last native empire of India, the Mughals, responsible for Taj Mahal and the proliferation of the Hindustani language, among other things, were originally an offshoot of the aforementioned Turko-Mongol Timurids.
</li><li> Gonzalo Guerrero, one of the shipwrecked Spanish sailors that Cortez encountered on his expedition, unlike his companion Aguilar Guerrero opted to stay with the Maya and would eventually side with them against his former countrymen.
</li><li> Many of the Norman families who settled in Ireland after the invasion of 1169 eventually became "Hiberniores Hibernicis ipsis"—more Irish than the Irish themselves—to the point where the government passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367, which banned the "English" in Ireland from adopting Irish customs, in a failed attempt to halt the process. It's not only Ireland, this trope defines the Normans. Originally they were Vikings who settled in Northern France, enthusiastically adopting French and converting to Catholicism. Wherever they went the Normans conquered, left their mark on the language and culture before being absorbed and integrating into their new homes.
</li><li> This was a constant theme in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">The British Empire</a>, both in its fiction, and actual administrative concern:
<ul><li> While Victorian and Edwardian British administrators and soldiers in British India were very derogatory about the native culture —<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden">partly to justify their rule</a> — —their 18th-century predecessors were much more complimentary — sometimes to the point of worshipfulness. The early years of the East India Company had many so-called "White Mughals" who adopted local customs and languages and marrying local women, and even took to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polygamy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polygamy">Polygamy</a> and conversion. (You can read about this in <em>White Mughals</em> by William Dalrymple; he says this was a time of widespread interracial sexual exploration, cultural assimilation and hybridity, and that nearly all Englishmen in India at that time did this.) The later Company generals nixed this hard, ostracizing many of these men. The British Raj and other colonies instituted a kind of apartheid to avoid mixing too much with the locals, or identifying with them too much. But the "white Mughal" tradition lives in the plethora of words, items, habits and tropes in modern British culture that stem from Indian culture.
</li><li> Alexander Burns, a.k.a. Bukhara Burnes is a good complex example of this. As an officer employed by the EITC, he became renowned as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldExplorer">Bold Explorer</a>, and spy, known for dressing in local Pashtun dresses, speaking their languages and understanding their customs. During his service in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, Burnes kept insisting to his superiors that they respect the ruler Amir Dost Muhammad, but they ignored him and launched the disastrous Afghan expedition instead. Burnes supported this out of loyalty even if he disagreed with it, and he dissipated in service, spending his time seducing and sleeping with local women, much to the distaste of Afghanis. The First Anglo-Afghan War broke out when a rebel contingent attacked the area where Burnes and his soldiers were quartered, and he was brutally killed, and to this day, Afghanis consider Burnes (the man who tried his best to learn their ways, to oppose British expansion there) to be a villain, a snake-like figure who tried to be one of them and failed, and in Victorian fiction, Burnes became a primary exhibit on why going native was not recommended. Burnes inspired such works as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoWouldBeKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWhoWouldBeKing">The Man Who Would Be King</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Kim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Kim">Kim</a></em> among others.
</li><li> T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), as an archaeologist in Arabia, went native long before the war. He was chosen as a liaison to the Arab rebels because he knew their ways so well and could speak most of their dialects. Particularly, he was one of the few British officers who didn't speak Arabic with an Egyptian dialect, which gained him the respect of the (peninsular) Arab leaders. He was sent to organize the Arabs against the Turks to weaken the German-Turkish-Austrian alliance but felt very conflicted about the whole process because he knew that the British and French were not going to keep their wartime promise of a free, united Arab state. He asked for a transfer to get out of leading a fake revolution—when his request was denied, he attempted to make the revolution successful enough to stick. He failed. After the war, he left Arabia for good, changed his name to Shaw, and joined the RAF as a mechanic, and lapsed into anonymity. The famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic">Biopic</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em> more or less dealt with his failure to fully cross the line.
</li></ul></li><li> US Special Forces are usually encouraged to assimilate into local cultures, adopt local customs and learn the language while on deployment. They also have a greatly relaxed uniform code which allows them to wear local dress and grow beards if necessary, and it is a common custom for them to wear the patches and emblems of any groups they are fighting alongside instead of the Stars and Stripes. This caused a minor incident when US commandos fighting ISIS were found to be wearing Kurdish flag and YPG patches, which Turkey, nominally a major US ally, consider terrorist symbols.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Pannwitz">Helmuth von Pannwitz<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a German general who was placed in command of the Cossacks who defected over to the Germans to fight the Soviet Union. Due to the respect and understanding he always showed for his troops and his tendency to attend Russian Orthodox services with them, Pannwitz was very popular among his Cossack volunteers. The Cossacks even voted him as their ataman, or supreme commander. When Pannwitz surrendered and his troops were turned over to the Soviets, he chose to go with them, even when told that as a German he was not subject to repatriation. He was convicted of war crimes and executed. The only thing preventing the whole thing from being a positive is the fact that the Cossack regiments under Pannwitz's command committed a number of atrocities against the civilian population, including several mass rapes, and routine summary executions. And, of course, continuing the Cossack tradition of Jewish pogroms.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>. Born a German Lutheran, she converted to the Eastern Orthodox Church in order to marry the Russian crown prince. Once she seized the throne from her husband, she fully embraced her adopted nation, expanding the size, influence, and progress of Russia. Indeed the fact that she became a much more observant Russian Orthodox than her husband and also did more to honor the memory of his predecessor, Empress Elizabeth, was a far from unimportant factor in her gathering the support she needed to oust her husband in the first place. Catherine the Great ultimately became just as autocratic, reform-halting, serf-oppressing, Pole-slaughtering and expansionist as any Russian autocrat.
<ul><li> One of her favourites, Stanisław II Augustus (generally better known as Poniatowski), the last King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, is a complicated case. He started out part of a powerful Polish noble family, if associated with Russians early on, and sent to Russia as a young man where he met a young Catherine. They became lovers, and she connived to keep him at court (including, improbably, as the Ambassador from Saxony), while he ended up pushing pro-Russian policies in the Polish <em>Sejm</em> (a semi-democratic institution not unlike the Roman Senate), participated in a coup attempt against the Polish King, and then became Catherine's chosen successor to the throne. This unsurprisingly meant that he was felt to have gone Russian. But as King, he tried to reform the Polish-Lithuanian government into something efficient and modern and patronised Polish arts and culture, essentially preserving Polish national identity, and even creating the constitution of 1791 that would have made Poland into a constitutional monarchy on the English model. However, while he is generally considered to have done his best to oppose Catherine's efforts to dismantle Poland, making a valiant but doomed attempt to fight back in the Polish-Russian War of 1792 (doomed because Poland was skint and Prussia refused to help). Even after his abdication, he spent the rest of his life on a limited Russian pension campaigning for the Polish cause. So, he was a Pole who went native in Russia, then went native again back in Poland.
</li></ul></li><li> Earlier in Russian history, the Nordic-descended nobility of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KievanRus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KievanRus">Kievan Rus'</a> gradually assimilated into the local culture as the empire evolved into the Eastern Slavic countries we know and love today: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belarus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belarus">Belarus</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ukraine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Scandinavian settler populations likewise went native in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">France</a> (specifically Normandy — the word "Norman" derives from "Norseman"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Britain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Britain">Britain</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ireland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ireland">Ireland</a>.
</li><li> The Magyarab people who live on the border between Egypt and Sudan are descended from 16th century Hungarian conscripts of the Ottoman Empire, which once encompassed both countries. Centuries of intermixing with Nubian women had made them separate from modern Magyars ethnically and linguistically (they are African-looking and speak Nubian Arabic, just like everyone else in the area), but to this day they and the people around them recognize that there is still <em>something</em> inherently foreign about them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bulgaria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> is named after the Bulgars, a group that started out ethnically Turkic or Indo-Iranian but merged with the Slavic population to the point where "Bulgar" and "Bulgaria" became something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>. This is in contrast with the lesser-known Volga Bulgaria in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a>, which maintained its Turkic identity until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mongolia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mongolia">Mongol</a> conquest centuries later. Even today, Turkic ethnic groups (specifically Tatar and Chuvash people) constitute a majority in the Volga Bulgars' former lands.
</li><li> In the 20th Century in Washington, DC, it was dogma among conservatives that the State Department was a nest of liberals/communists. Every time a Republican president was elected, it was hoped that the new Secretary of State they appointed would set things straight down there. Much to their chagrin, however, it was invariably discovered that the new boss had instead taken on his subordinates' colors. He had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Gone Native</a>.
<ul><li> This is likely a problem of ideology not tracking reality. There was a feeling in Britain for much of the 20th century that the foreign office was cynical and conservative and similar disappointment when Labour foreign ministers were often seen to have 'gone native'. The truth is that most state department/foreign offices tend to be run along very pragmatic lines. If you are an ideologue/idealist of some sort—you think the state department should do more to dismantle and oppose communist regimes, or you think the foreign office should have a hand in ousting dictators regardless of whether we have 'friendly' relations with them—you're bound to be disappointed by a pragmatic approach and conclude foreign policy is being run by your ideological opponents.
</li></ul></li><li> J. Hudson Taylor, a British missionary in China, wore Chinese clothing, wore his hair in the Manchu queue, and spoke Chinese to be able to be better accepted by the Chinese public.
<ul><li> Matteo Ricci, Jesuit priest and missionary, also mastered the Chinese language (including its complicated writing system), wore Chinese robes and was the first Westerner to visit the Forbidden City.
</li></ul></li><li> The escaped convict <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Buckley_%28convict%29">William Buckley<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFBuckleyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFBuckleyJr">that one</a>) spent several years living among Aboriginal Australians. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianSlang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianSlang">Australian Slang</a> term "Buckley's chance" ("close to no chance") comes from his name.
</li><li> Soldiers from any number of long-term occupying armies over the centuries have found themselves in settled lives, even marrying locals and having children, in the occupied countries. For example, it's on record that when the Roman legions were finally ordered back to Rome to defend the capital of the collapsing empire a lot of them quietly deserted to stay with their families.
</li><li> William Adams also known as Miura Anjin, an English ship's pilot working for the Dutch who eventually became an adviser to Tokugawa Ieyasu and was responsible for setting up Dutch and English trading houses in Japan. He was officially made a samurai by Ieyasu and served as the inspiration for the Blackthorne character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shogun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shogun">Shogun</a></em>.
</li><li> Ely Parker, chief of the Six Civilized Nations, was an assimilated American Indian. He fought in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a> and was with Grant at Appomattox.
</li><li> Henry "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Papillon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Papillon">Papillon</a>" Charriere reportedly spent some time with a native tribe in South America after one of his escapes from a French penal colony. He made friends with the chief, adopted a local lifestyle and subsistence, and married two women with whom he fathered children. However, there are doubts about how much of the story is true as Charriere is suspected of combining tales from other prisoners with his own and outright making some parts up for drama.
</li><li> There was a hilarious Transylvanian Internet meme in the form of a log that detailed a Hungarian politician becoming more Romanian with every entry, as indicated by his knowledge of the language improving, but his style becoming more raw and primitive. (As you might have guessed, the two groups don't much like each other.)
</li><li> Lafcadio Hearn had a knack at this. Born in Greece to a local mother and an Irish father, he ended up traveling from Ireland to America, where he became a newspaper writer. After stirring up scandal by marrying a black woman, Hearn spent ten years in New Orleans, fell in love with its Creole culture, and through his writings basically created the distinct character of the city. In 1890 he wound up in Japan, and six years later had become a naturalized citizen under the name Koizumi Yakumo. He married into a samurai family and spent the last eight years of his life writing over a dozen books about the country, introducing Western audiences to Japan while documenting his new homeland's myths and legends at a time it was advancing into modernity. Though he's fairly obscure in the West, Hearn/Yakumo is still held in high regard in Japan. If you know him, it's likely because you read "The Boy Who Drew Cats" when you were a kid, or are a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> fan who got into the setting's supplementary material.
</li><li> The Lombards, who conquered Italy in the 6th century, adopted Italian culture to the point that not even the Lombard language was spoken by the 8th century.
<ul><li> Same with the Manchus in China: they basically adopted Chinese culture and language, and even though many people in northern China claim to be ethnic Manchu, there are only about a dozen speakers of the Manchu language left.
</li></ul></li><li> The Native American woman Pocahontas adopted Christianity and English customs after being abducted by the settlers of Jamestown.
</li><li> In reminiscence of a specific lord chancellor and archbishop of Canterbury who later paid his switch with his life, going native in a particular institution has been described as the "Becket effect" by economists (Thomas à Becket started his political career as a thoroughly loyal pawn of Henry II and a party boy. After his ascension to the archbishopric he became one of the Catholic Church's main champions in England, and an ascetic to boot). Generally, whenever a (supposed) pawn of a national government gets into a position like the European Commission or the European Central Bank, he quickly becomes a man of the club and ceases to be the lackey of his "principal", much to the chagrin of their promoters.
</li><li> Hasekura Tsunenaga led an expedition to Europe in 1614 at the behest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DateMasamune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DateMasamune">Date Masamune</a> on the European-styled ship <em>San Juan Bautista/ Date Maru</em>. These explorations were the first Japan had ever made to explore the world and went to many Christian nations. Date was a patron of Japanese Christians, while Hasekura and many of the men who served under him as the ships crew were actually Christian. At least five of these crew members would opt to stay in Coria del Rio, a small town in Spain, rather than risk persecution and death as Christians in Japan. Many in the town today claim to be descendants of the crewmen, who have taken up the surname <em>Japón</em> (Japan), and a statue of Hasekura stands there.
</li><li> Steppe cultures like the Mongol Empire tend to do this whenever it forms an empire in settled lands. There are a number of reasons for this: the pasture is not suitable for their horses, the local culture is the only source of bureaucrats and siege engineers for further conquests, and the settled places are just plain rich and viands, concubines, and palaces are more fun than yurts. It is common though to maintain nominal deference to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays">Good Old Ways</a> like building giant game preserves to hunt in or having horsetails as a flag.
<ul><li> As mentioned above, the Timurids did this <em>twice</em>: they were a Central Asian steppe empire that eventually assimilated into Persian culture in the 14th century, and then in the 16th century, a Timurid king conquered much of India, forming the Mughal Empire that assimilated into <em>Indian</em> culture.
</li><li> Somewhat similar were the Magyar horsemen who settled into Eastern Europe. Their Hungarian descendants, while having long since adopted European customs and styles, still retain elements of their nomadic past, including their language.
</li></ul></li><li> Many immigrants or expats will find themselves doing as the locals do, taking up new languages, studying for citizenship tests, and adopting local customs as to fit in better at their new home.
<ul><li> A general rule of thumb in countries such as the US and Canada that have large immigrant populations is that the children born in their new home are, generally speaking, almost fully assimilated in the general culture, and their children certainly will be.
</li><li> The Peranakan Chinese of South East Asia are typically descended from Chinese traders who settled in what was then the Spice Islands or the East Indies (Nanyang to the Chinese). After a few generations their customs and cuisine absorbed a lot of Malay influences, going native, although they do maintain distinct traditions based on their Chinese roots. Notably, this is in stark contrast to the later generation of Chinese immigrants to Malaya and Singapore that came during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who ended up maintaining their own distinct Chinese communities and languages to the present day due to colonial racial separation policies enforced by the British and the subsequent ethnic tension that would linger for decades.
</li></ul></li><li> There also exists inversions of this trope, where instead of someone assimilating into the local culture, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal">the local culture assimilates into that someone</a>:
<ul><li> In Britain, the Anglo-Saxons ended up assimilating the native Britons to their language and culture, absorbing the native Celtic culture in most what is now England around the 6th and 7th centuries CE, and even that was not exclusive - Cumbric, a Celtic language closely related to Welsh survived until the 12th century and Cornish survived until the 17th century. Speaking of Celtic, it's a little-known fact that it was the dominant language group of continental Europe before the turn of the 1st millennium BCE; before Germanic and later Romance languages displaced them.
</li><li> Scythians/Sarmatians were the dominant culture of Central Asia and Eastern Europe before the 4th century CE, when East Slavic tribes conquered and assimilated them in Eastern Europe. They survived for a couple more centuries in Central Asia until the various Turkic and Persian kingdoms finally did them in.
</li><li> Most parts of the modern Arab world didn't speak Arabic until the Arab conquests and spread of Islam in the 7th century. The Iraqis and Levantines (Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians, Palestinians) spoke Aramaic, the Yemenis spoke Old South Arabian, the Egyptians spoke... Egyptian (well, Coptic), the Sudanese spoke Nubian, and the Maghrebis (everyone west of Egypt) spoke Berber.
</li><li> What is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Turkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Turkey">Turkey</a> had underwent numerous changes to its main language. The population began to embrace Turkish in Eastern Anatolia after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, when the Oghuz Turks defeated the Byzantines. It should be noted that Manzikert wasn't quite the critical battle later Byzantine historians, and others who followed their lead, saw it as when looking for the point when their decline began, despite the fact that the Emperor was captured <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5x5dw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5x5dw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5x5dw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> After the traditional boot on neck pose, he was treated very politely, ransomed and released at the first opportunity. The main loss was the Emperor's valuable baggage train. From a military point it wasn't so much 'tipping point' as 'horrendously embarrassing'.</span> However, it was around that point that Turkish started being spoken widely in Eastern Anatolia. Before that, it was Greek-speaking in the west and Armenian-speaking in the east. They themselves were originally replacements of the Ancient Anatolians, composed of numerous Indo-European tribes unrelated to either, as well as other Bronze Age cultures speaking language isolates (the Hurrians being a notable example). Some of them were even Celts, oddly enough.
</li><li> Something similar occurred in Pannonia; prior to the coming of the Magyars, the inhabitants there spoke various Latin and Slavic dialects. After the conquest, inhabitants of Pannonia started switching to speaking Hungarian/Magyar.
</li></ul></li><li> Wherever there is a frontier there are instances of Going Native back and forth. If the original cultures are strikingly different this can lead to some weird looking convolutions, like Indians with English names or fur hunters with Indian dress and Indian wives or mistresses.
</li><li> The Pakeha Maori of New Zealand, early European settlers who lived amongst the Maori. Some were taken as slaves, others (such as Frederick Edward Maning) lived with Maori voluntarily, often for trade or religious reasons. A very few even received moko.
</li><li> Zigzagged by Indias MARCOS (Marine Commandos). They wear beards while on deployment to Kashmir and learn the local language to operate effectively as a counterinsurgency strike team. However, since Kashmir is technically part of India, it isnt so much going native as it is just going local.
</li><li> Arthur Andersen accountants sent to verify the accounts of Enron had their offices in the Enron's building and were wholly integrated in the office life of Enron, participating to the evenings and the parties and acquiring their corporate values; this played an important role to explain why they didn't notice the books were cooked.
</li><li> In the first and second World Wars, many African-American soldiers stationed in Europe elected to stay after the war was over due to Western Europe lacking the widespread racism of America, with France, Italy, and the UK being particularly popular due to interracial marriage not being as taboo as it was in the United States at the time.
