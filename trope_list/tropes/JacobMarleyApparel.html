<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JubeiChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JubeiChan">Jubei-chan</a></em>: the ghost of Yagyu Jubei is <em>younger</em> in the second season than he appears in the first, in addition to wearing different clothes. Presumably this is because of how Koinosuke and Freesia remember him from different periods of his life.
</li><li> Sayo Aisaka in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> has been wearing the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorFuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorFuku">Sailor Fuku</a> for 60 years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma Â½</a></em>:
<ul><li> Might have drawn some inspiration from Kogane, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl">Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl</a> from Furinkan High, who also wore a sailor fuku even when the school didn't use it as its uniform.
</li><li> Another ghost was a former headmistress for an extremely old, dilapidated all-girls school and dormitory. Until her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyGoals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostlyGoals">Ghostly Goals</a> are fulfilled, she's dressed in period clothes and wears her hair in a bun, as well as thin and pointy sunglasses. When she's finally allowed to move on, she trades the clothes for an angel's robe and wings, but keeps the bun and sunglasses.
</li></ul></li><li> Tomoharu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AsuraCryin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AsuraCryin">Asura Cryin'</a></em> questions his ghost girl follower Misao on why this trope doesn't apply to her. Misao responds in turn that it "would be boring." While it's not entirely clear how a ghost girl can change her clothes, Misao can.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostSweeperMikami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostSweeperMikami">Ghost Sweeper Mikami</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's mentioned that a ghost usually wears the clothes they were wearing in the time of their death. Okinu Himuro, in example, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">Shinto priestess</a> who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">sacrificed</a> to a Mountain God, so she wears her red and white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">Miko</a> robes.
</li><li> There's a <em>youkai</em> who can make special clothes for ghosts, and an episode of the anime has Yokoshima searching for her so he can give some modern outfits to Okinu as a gift.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube">Hell Teacher Nube</a></em>, naturally, ghosts subscribe to this rule. Which is especially bad for those who died after being horribly mutilated, because they'll spend their days trying to replace their missing body parts. But most notably: when Hiroshi found himself on the verge of death, his soul wore the hospital gown during his brief adventure in the afterlife. The cute girl whose soul he saved from demons <em>also</em> wore a hospital gown in the afterlife, but it turned out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was an incredibly ancient old woman who became hopelessly smitten with her savior</span>.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DuskMaidenOfAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DuskMaidenOfAmnesia">Dusk Maiden of Amnesia</a></em>. Yuuko died 50 or 60 years ago, but when Teiichi first meets her, she's wearing the modern school uniform. She liked the new design when she saw it, so she <em>somehow</em> got one of her own. She's still got her old uniform, too, and changes into that to show Teiichi... embarrassing him, because she doesn't change clothes by <em>magic</em>, she does it just as an ordinary girl would â€” except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl">right in front of him</a>.
</li><li> Also averted in <em>Bakekano</em>, where Alice first appears naked and has to concentrate to create the clothes she wears although the clothes she normally wears are those which she's most familiar with. When first seen she's wearing thighhighs and a backpack because they're her favorite socks and her backpack was one she kept bugging her mother for. She can apparently also share the clothes with others so long as she can concentrate.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>, Nadeshiko has her wedding ring, because she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to Fujitaka (who for his part follows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter">The Mourning After</a> trope), sometimes bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a> (at least according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Sonomi</a>).
<ul><li> Also, Touya described seeing all manner of ghosts, sometimes with remnants of injuries inflicted upon them (such as missing limbs). His descriptions of what he was able to see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until he gave up his clairvoyant powers to save his boyfriend's life</span> were the reason for Sakura's fear of ghosts.
</li></ul></li><li> Meiko "Menma" Honma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AnoHanaTheFlowerWeSawThatDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AnoHanaTheFlowerWeSawThatDay">Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day</a></em> wears the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtherealWhiteDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtherealWhiteDress">white and blue sundress</a> she wore when she drowned, although it is larger since her ghost is older and taller than she was at death and wears no shoes (which were presumably washed away by the river).
</li><li> An interesting case occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure">Jojos Bizarre Adventure</a></em>. Reimi Sugimoto's ghost looks exactly as she did on death, as does her dog. On the occasion we see someone die, their soul floats through her alley, bearing all the wounds of their deaths. However, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yoshikage Kira</span> dies, he still looks like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kosaku Kawajiri</span>, which would fit this trope - but when he <em>realizes</em> he's dead, he changes into his original body.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> manga, the late Hoover visits Shin in his dreams wearing his flight suit.
</li><li> The Impure World Resurrection technique in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> brings back the dead in whatever clothes they were wearing when they died. This is clearly demonstrated when a man who'd taken off his shirt is killed, then immediately brought back, also without his shirt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheVoynichHotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheVoynichHotel">The Voynich Hotel</a></em> both plays this trope straight and plays with it.
<ul><li> A drug dealer staying in the hotel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">was killed by a sniper</a>, and as a ghost he's missing a large chunk of his head.
</li><li> Hundreds of years ago, another character took a poisoned arrow in the chest, but due to being a witch, this wasn't enough to truly kill her. She's now a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenantZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenantZombie">Revenant Zombie</a>, and her body withering and decaying has made the hole from the arrow as big as her hand, with her ribs visible inside it.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">Â Â Â Â ArtsÂ </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Several saints from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/SistineChapel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/SistineChapel">Sistine Chapel</a>'s <em>The Last Judgement</em> surrounding the risen Christ are holding objects that were used to execute them for their faith.
<ul><li> Saint Andrew is seen holding an X-shaped cross, which Christian tradition says the Romans used to kill him.
</li><li> Saint Bartholomew pops out because he's seen holding a man's skin while holding a knife in the other hand. This may look like Bartholomew skinned someone, but closer inspection of the skin makes it obvious he's holding <em>his own flayed skin</em>.
</li><li> Saint Blaise is holding the iron combs used to rip his flesh apart.
</li><li> Saint Catherine is sitting next to a broken wheel of spikes, which legends says the Roman Emperor tried to use to slowly torture and kill her, only for it to miraculously fall apart as soon as she touched it. Unable to elaborately torture her, the Emperor had her swiftly beheaded.
</li><li> Saint Lawrence holds a ladder, referencing the legend that he died while being burnt over hot coils, only to snark that "It's cooked enough now," before his death.
</li><li> Saint Sebastian holds the arrows he was pierced with before being beaten to death.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">Â Â Â Â Comic BooksÂ </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em>Proposition Player</em> (wherein the protagonist Joey Martin accidentally becomes owner of a number of people's souls) this is considered a "default setting" until a soul's caretaker specifies otherwise, to avoid blocking up the celestial mechanics. Hugin and Munin tells Joey he can "have them come back as cows or ducks or angels of light" but until he decides to do so, this trope is in effect, and changes aren't retroactive. Naturally, before he even knows what to do, a competitive archangel kills off most of the contractees in a massive and complex accident, resulting in his makeshift afterlife (aka apartment) filling up with, among others, a waitress with her head on a platter, a guy with rebar through his face, a guy crushed flat, a pile of ashes, and a pile of crocodile feces. And they're still sentient. Also again, not retroactive.

</li><li> Recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> supervillain Gentleman Ghost always appears in the clothes of his time period; as that's the nineteenth century, he's depicted with a top hat, full suit, gloves, monocle, and ruffled jabot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZombiesChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZombiesChristmasCarol">Zombies Christmas Carol</a></em>, Jacob Marley's chains were designed to keep his zombified form in check, including a muzzle so he couldn't bite people.

</li><li> Essentially applies to Neo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhatIf">What If?</a></em>, who apparently cannot change out of the clothes he was wearing when Cypher pulled the plug, although he muses that the outfit actually isnÂ’t that bad and he can at least make it look cleaner.

All the other characters wear the clothes they died in as well. Of course they are reanimated corpses, instead of entirely spiritual beings, so they wear what they were buried in.

<ul><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beetlejuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a></em> had this for every ghost except, oddly enough, for the two leads, who drowned but were only a bit damp when they got home (though, at the very least, they remained in the same clothes). And they dried out, too (likely because it would have been impractical to keep the actors damp for the whole of shooting, but still). The other obviously wrong-looking ghosts were the ones who died in disfiguring ways or, as in the case of the headhunter and showgirl/receptionist, were explicitly in costume at death. And, if you look closely, Juno has smoke coming out the holes in her throat when she smokes. The title character himself does not have this feature, being more like a demonic ghost than a disfigured human. But then, he likely hasn't been human for a <em>long</em> time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFrighteners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFrighteners">The Frighteners</a></em>, one of the ghosts complains about his ridiculous 1970s outfit (complete with big bushy afro), and another points out that he must wear it because he was dressed like that when he died. After his ghostly form is destroyed by the big bad, he is seen in Heaven at the end of the film, wearing far more fashionable clothes and much shorter hair.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HushHushSweetCharlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HushHushSweetCharlotte">Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte</a></em>, the fake ghosts appear this way to Charlotte as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness">Driven to Madness</a> ploy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense">The Sixth Sense</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All the clothes that Dr. Crowe wore throughout the entire movie were clothes that he wore at some point during the night he died.</span>
<ul><li> While the other ghosts are also wearing the same clothing from time periods that they died in, they were shown with gashes, wounds, blood and nooses they are hanged from like the woman in a bathrobe with a black eye and scars on her wrists hence that she died from cutting herself and the vomiting girl who died from being poisoned.
</li></ul></li><li> Clarence from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em> spends the entire film in a nightgown, a gift from his wife, having passed away in it.
<ul><li> Actually somewhat averted in that Clarence is wearing somewhat "modern" clothing on top of his old-fashioned underwear. He even complained about not having time to get any "stylish underwear."
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stardust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stardust">Stardust</a></em>, the dead princes are all wearing what they had on when they died, and their bodies are in whatever state they expired in: One who died in the tub spent the rest of his ghostly life naked, and one who fell out of a window had his face flattened, and his hair is in a permanent windblown style.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, Force ghosts follow this rule, looking as old or young as they did upon the time of death, and wearing the same clothes. The exception is Anakin Skywalker, who despite dying in full Darth Vader regalia, missing limbs, and with a disfigured head, reverts to what he would have looked like in more benign circumstances.
<ul><li> He was later changed to Hayden Christiansen's Anakin, so maybe that was supposed to be his appearance when he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">killed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView">by Darth Vader.</a> The robes are still different though.
</li><li> One of the novels mentions that you appear how you think of yourself. Thus, the Jedi are all in their customary robes, the Sith are in their armor, and Skywalker views himself as the young man before he fell.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2008 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostTown">Ghost Town</a></em>, Bertram Pincus is followed around by ghosts who are dressed in whatever they were wearing when they died, including one nude man. One of the ghosts, Frank, is wearing a tuxedo and carrying around a Blackberry, and comments on how he's grateful that he downloaded some games on it before he died.
</li><li> Semi-averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLovelyBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLovelyBones">The Lovely Bones</a></em>, in that Susie can change clothes when she wants, but her default clothes are the ones she wore when she died.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thir13enGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thir13enGhosts">Thir13en Ghosts</a></em> (2001): Even after death, the titular 13 ghosts carry various individual objects relating to their persona.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TowerOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TowerOfTerror">Tower of Terror</a></em> film is similar to the <em>Lovely Bones</em> example above. The ghosts' default clothes are the ones they died in, but one of the ghosts appears in other clothes twice. Her other outfits also look 1930s, so apparently she can wear other clothes as long as they're from the time period when she died. Whatever.
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghost">Ghost</a></em>, Sam (and apparently all other ghosts) wear what they were wearing at the time of death, though without any damage they took in dying, and the ghosts themselves have no visible wounds.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon">An American Werewolf in London</a></em>, David's friend Jack is still wearing the parka that he died in, complete with the slash-across-the-face marks of the werewolf attack. While his clothes remain the same, his body decays into a near-skeleton by the end of the movie.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostGoesWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostGoesWest">The Ghost Goes West</a></em>, Murdoch Glourie died with his Jacobite outfit, and itÂ’s the only thing heÂ’s got while haunting his castle.
</li><li> While not actually ghosts, most of the souls living in the unnamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">suicide</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneAfterlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneAfterlife">afterlife</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WristcuttersALoveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WristcuttersALoveStory">Wristcutters: A Love Story</a></em> all keep the injuries that they sustained when they killed themselves, although the wounds are empty of any blood or other gibs. They are able to change clothes, however, and this being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneAfterlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneAfterlife">Mundane Afterlife</a>, there are even stores that sell them. Also, this only really seems to apply if you killed yourself by a method that resulted in an open wound, such as blowing your brains out or slitting your wrists, as supposed to things like poison, hanging, drug overdose, or electrocuting yourself by dumping beer on your electric guitar while it was plugged in (yes, really), which don't seem to effect the soul's appearance noticeably.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMenTellNoTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMenTellNoTales">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales</a></em>, Salazar and the rest of <em>Silent Mary</em>'s ghostly crew appear in the clothing and condition in which they died. This is particularly unfortunate for the sailor who's reduced to nothing but a floating, independently-moving arm and boots - implying everything else of him was destroyed by a cannonball - and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">particularly disturbing</a> with Salazar himself, who drowned underwater and whose hair constantly drifts around his head in nonexistent currents.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AChristmasCarolGoesWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AChristmasCarolGoesWrong">A Christmas Carol Goes Wrong</a></em>, this creates problems when Marley's chains are so heavy they drag him out the window and smash through the floor.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">Â Â Â Â LiteratureÂ </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> is Charles Dickens' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> where the ghost of - who else? - Jacob Marley is dressed not only in the clothes he died in, but is wrapped in chains and lugs around safes and cashboxes for all eternity to symbolically represent his avarice in life. It's not played entirely straight, however, as he also wears a cloth that was tied in place after death to bind his jaw shut.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Silverwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Silverwing">Silverwing</a></em> book, <em>Firewing</em>. Three ghostly bats, named Java, Nemo, and Yorick, discuss their deaths. Java, who died of old age, and Nemo, who was eaten (leaving no body behind and the resulting ghost being made wholesale), have fully equipped and working ghost bodies. Yorick, who died smashed against a tree by a sudden turn of wind, gets to spend his afterlife with a perpetually broken wing, and demands to know where the justice is.
</li><li> In the novel <em>Haunted</em> David's dead sister, Juliet, still appears as a child from when she drowned in their pond.
</li><li> Similarly lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> with the Hogwarts ghosts; Nearly Headless Nick laments that he can't join the Headless Hunt, as he wasn't <em>quite</em> decapitated enough.
<ul><li> Played straight with the Bloody Baron, who's still caked in the blood of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Grey Lady</span> and wears chains out of penance.
</li><li> Interestingly, one of the ghosts at the "deathday party" in the second book is "a ragged man wearing chains" â€” a possible reference to Jacob Marley himself.
</li><li> Averted by the magically animated portraits of deceased Hogwarts headmasters and others, which apparently have whatever clothes are painted onto them. It's unclear how these painting are created and whether they can be categorized as "ghosts," but for story purposes they are functionally the same.
</li></ul></li><li> Mocked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmbroseBierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmbroseBierce">Ambrose Bierce</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDevilsDictionary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDevilsDictionary">The Devil's Dictionary</a></em> (and used as an unattributed quote passed off as an original insight by Penn Gillette on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PennAndTellerBullshit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PennAndTellerBullshit">Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!</a></em>) who asked why ghosts aren't naked. Is the immortal soul of a person dressed in the immortal soul of <em>textiles</em>?
<ul><li> Another <a class="urllink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ghtX84t1WC8C&amp;printsec=toc&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0">author<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, thirty years earlier, similarly mocks: "But what does the ghost represent? That is, what is it the ghost of? A man or a woman to be sure. But does it appear as a man or a woman only? Is it nude? Oh no! Oh shocking! This is contrary to all the rules. It always appears dressed! ... So then, we have the ghost of the clothes also - the ghost of the coat and unmentionables - the ghost of the cocked hat and wig. How is this?"
</li></ul></li><li> Used straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShamanOfTheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShamanOfTheUndead">Shaman of the Undead</a></em>. Until you get to the Land of the Dead, you get to keep all the clothes and wounds you had when you died. Notably, Ida nicknames <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">MikoÅ‚aj's</span> ghost "One-eyed Cannibal" before she learns his name precisely because of this trope.
</li><li> Used straight in Dian Curtis Regan's series <em>Ghost Twins</em>. The pair of pre-teens (and their dog) who drowned in a lake haunt that same lake, not wet, but wearing those same clothes (and the girl <em>hates</em> the jumper she was, is, and will forever until the end of Time be wearing).
</li><li> Ghosts in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters">Wyrd Sisters</a></em> wear the clothes they died in (until they lose cohesion to the point where this can't be made out any more), and King Champot, who claims to have been beheaded by his nephew after building Lancre Castle, has his head under his arm. Subverted in the <em>Discworld Companion</em> which claims no-one knows <em>why</em> Champot has his head under his arm, since he actually died of gout.
<ul><li> There's also a nicely subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> (if that's not a contradiction) in the TV version, when King Verence recognises the Crown of Lancre and takes off the ghost crown he's wearing to compare them.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tamsin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tamsin">Tamsin</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSBeagle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSBeagle">Peter S. Beagle</a>, in which the ghost Tamsin can appear in different clothes and hair styles that she had worn in her life, provided she can remember them enough.
</li><li> In E. W. Hildick's juvenile mystery series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostSquad">Ghost Squad</a></em>, ghosts always appear in the clothes they died in, but explicitly not the <em>condition</em> they died in. This is mostly used for opening sequences about how inappropriate the ghost's attire is for their surroundings, before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">revealing the reason</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everlost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everlost">Everlost</a></em> by Neal Shusterman, Afterlights, the spirits of children who died but who became trapped between the world of the living and "where they were going" enter the realm of Everlost appearing as they did when they died. Thus, Nick, one of the main characters, is dressed in a suit and his face is smeared with chocolate. One boy is stuck in a speedo and is constantly wet. However, one can accidentally change his or her appearance if he or she forgets what he or she looks like or what people look like.
</li><li> This is played straight in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OddThomas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OddThomas">Odd Thomas</a></em> series for most ghosts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> is the exception to the rule, capable of appearing in whatever he feels like wearing. The main character speculates that because Elvis ignored the rules when he was alive, he continues to do so in death. (The ghost of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> is later shown to have the same ability.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlueGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlueGirl">The Blue Girl</a></em>, Adrian learns from the ghost of a rebellious teenager that he can return to the mortal coil one night per year. Said ghost died in a car crash with a pack of cigarettes on him, which retains the same number of cigs, no matter how many he smokes, and he also keeps his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDean">James Dean</a> style clothing.
</li><li> In <em>The Night Tourist</em> by Katherine Marsh, pretty much every ghost is like this, and one of the main characters, Euri, is teased about dying in her school uniform.
</li><li> Ghosts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap">Septimus Heap</a></em> always look like they did when they were killed. For example, Queen Cerys and Alther Mella have visible wounds from the shots that killed them.
</li><li> The titular spirit of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a>: Ghost of the Jedi</em> still bears the tattered robes and gaping wounds given to him by Darth Vader. Since he was killed and Vader burned the library he was guarding, he feels like too much of a failure to move on, and the wounds are part of his penance. When Tash helps him and he helps her back, his wounds close and he reunites with the Force.
</li><li> Not ghosts, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyPantheon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyPantheon">Fantasy Pantheon</a> in the <em>Tales from Mythos</em> story collections, which is made up of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">deities of human origin</a>, are depicted in art and idols with injuries they sustained performing their godhood-worthy deed. For example, Adal carries his severed head, and Ervah has a gaping wound from stabbing herself in the heart.
</li><li> The three ghosts in Chris Bohjalian's <em>The Night Strangers,</em> who died when their plane crashed during a water landing. All three are dripping wet and have parts of the plane still protruding through their bodies.
</li><li> Averted with Sadie's ghost in <em>Twenties Girl</em> by Sophie Kinsella. Sadie is wearing a different twenties-style dress and different accessories every time she materializes. Some of them are dresses she wore during her lifetime, others are friends' dresses that she used to envy. Also, she was 105 when she died, but her ghost appears as a 23-year-old.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearStreet">Fear Street</a></em> book <em>Why I'm Not Afraid of Ghosts,</em> the POV switches between a boy living in a haunted house and the two ghost children who are haunting it. The ghost boy, Robbie, is wearing a sailor suit, which he hates, but unfortunately is stuck with it because of this trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShamanBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShamanBlues">Shaman Blues</a></em>, this is usually not the case, which is why when "gutsies" (ghosts whose bodies are ripped open and whose bones and innards stick out) appear, everyone in death magic business gets worried.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ghostgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ghostgirl">ghostgirl</a></em> and all sequels, this could be considered an important plot point. You reach the "afterlife classroom" with exactly the appearance you had when you died and you specifically get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">Alliterative</a> nickname from it, such as Metal Mike, who died in a car crash and has car parts protruding from all over his body. To add to it, as the main character finds out, the injuries that kill you will continue to bother you forever: she died by choking on a gummybear and has to get used to the permanent lump in her throat and constant need to cough. It also stands to note that her obvious nickname "Choking Charlotte" never comes up, as she is very careful to <em>never</em> mention the way she died and it's not apparent from looks alone.

At one point, the hero is in danger (and dressed in a ridiculous pirate getup), and the ghost tells him that whatever he's wearing when he dies, that's what he'll be wearing for eternity.
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em>, often for comedic effect. If the reaper doesn't remove the soon-to-be-killed person's soul before they die, the ghost ends up looking like their corpse. Considering the main cast dealt exclusively in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HowToKillACharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HowToKillACharacter">accidental deaths</a>, the results could be pretty extreme.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanHorrorStoryMurderHouse">American Horror Story: Murder House</a></em>, while some ghosts are stuck in their ghostly attire, such as the nurses or the twins, other ghosts are able to change clothes, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tate, Violet and the rest of the Harmon family</span>. This may also be affected by whether or not they remember dying. Also, some of the ghosts carry their wounds with them, such as Nora, who maintains a gaping wound on the back of her head, and Moira who has a ghostly eye where she was shot, but again, this does not apply to all the ghosts in the house.
</li><li> The series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLast">Dead Last</a></em> had the main characters able to see ghosts, and unwillingly help them leave the earthly plane. One ghost had killed himself while naked, and had to walk around like that.
</li><li> Ezekiel Stone, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Brimstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Brimstone">Brimstone</a></em>, always has exactly what he died with on him â€” including his handgun, whose bullets instantly replenish themselves as they're fired, and the $36.27 US he had in his pockets, which reappears in his pockets every single time he reaches in for it.
</li><li> An infirm Promicin-powered old woman on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred">The 4400</a></em> had the power to astrally project. Because the astral projection was powered by her thoughts and imagination, it was her when she was at the full flower of her youth, clad in a hot dress. When she was killed with an overdose, the astral projection simply changed into a ghost that resembled her at the full flower of her youth still wearing a hot dress, rather than becoming an infirm old woman.
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> had Buffy identify a vampire by his outdated clothing, suggesting that this applies in some ways to vampires. Vampires aren't required to dress like they did when they were alive, as evidenced by Angel's leather jacket, but it might be hard for them to adjust to changes in fashion. Or maybe they just don't bother to find new clothes. This seems largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">forgotten about</a> after the first episode.
<ul><li> Also, in another episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E19IOnlyHaveEyesForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E19IOnlyHaveEyesForYou">I Only Have Eyes For You</a>", James and Grace wear 1950s attire when they met their demises. James had a rotting face instead of a bullet wound he shot himself with to scare Buffy.

<ul><li> Wesley decapitates Lilah after her death to ensure she won't become a vampire. When Lilah turns up later, she's wearing a scarf to cover the wound (or possibly, as implied, because her head isn't on securely.)
</li><li> In the comic, Wesley is permanently-bound to one of his old <em>Buffy</em>-era suits. Wesley surmises the Senior Partners are just finding new ways to torment him some more, since the suit and glasses are a reminder of his past self that he left behind.

</li><li> Somewhat justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder">Six Feet Under</a></em>, where the "ghosts" are implied to be manifestations of the living characters' states of mind rather than actual spirits. Since they're mostly clients of the funeral home, it makes sense that the characters would visualise them dressed in whatever they died in.

Then she discovers that she can only wear clothes of other dead people. So she visits the morgue like ordinary girls visit the mall.
<ul><li> Though that doesn't explain how she can get bags of crisps from the vending machine. And eat them. In crowded rooms. While having a two-way conversation with her still-living best friend without said friend being carted off to a nice padded room.

However, they always stay in the same outfit they wore at the time of their death.
<ul><li> This is a important plot point at several times since some ghosts forget who they had been, forcing Melinda to research their identity based on what they have and how they look, such as with the Clown she finds in a basement <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who can't remember why he looks like one because he actually was a private detective</span>.

<ul><li> Look up any martyred saint of the Roman Catholic tradition, you'll find them either outfitted with the instrument of their execution (St. Andrew with his X-shaped cross, St. Catherine leaning on her wheel) or perhaps holding their own body parts: St. Lucy will be holding an extra set of eyes on a plate (as will St. Agatha with a set of breasts â€” look it up if you don't believe me), St. Bartholomew is sometimes shown holding his own skin, and St. Denis is always carrying around his own head. Guess Heaven doesn't come with health insurance...
<ul><li> This is because each saint is depicted with a symbol that would identify them to the illiterate during that period of history where literacy was the exception. Not all symbols relate to their martyrdom (though many do) â€” the gospel authors are depicted with one of the four familiar beasts, St Peter with the keys to heaven, St Jaques de Compostelle bears a scallop, etc.
</li><li> An interesting aversion of this also occurs in Revelation 6:11; the martyrs, those slain for God's sake, are specifically given new outfits (pure white robes).
</li></ul></li><li> In Chinese culture, paper offerings are burnt so that dead family members might have them in the afterlife. Usually they're hell notes, paper tender recognized in the afterlife, but they can also be paper gifts, like paper stereos, food, clothes, and even paper servants. The paper offerings get updated with time â€” at one point, people burnt regular old (paper) house phones. Later on they started burning those huge "brick" cellphones in paper form. They actually burn paper PSPs, NDSes, and PS3s along with the paper iPhones now. Not enough? Try an entire miniature paper mansion with tiny servants inside with a paper car in the garage.
</li><li> In a somewhat lesser-known piece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/PacificMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/PacificMythology">Pacific Mythology</a> made into a hula mu'u mu'u (Dance of the Wounded Spirit), there is a disembodied spirit named Manamanaiakaluea, who is missing both sets of limbs.

<ul><li> A common trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion">Wraith: The Oblivion</a></em> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf">White Wolf</a>, both in respect to clothes and cause-of-death - the explanation is that the wraith's psyche surrounds itself in a shell of corpus to anchor itself to the Shadowlands (if all corpus is destroyed, the psyche falls into the Tempest and is a ready target by the Shadow) and can look like anything, but often a familiar form. Interestingly, self-image can play a part; one woman who suffered frailty during a time of disease always felt as though her hands and arms were withered bones, so that's how she turned out on the other side. The appearance can change over time and often become more twisted as they amass Angst and lose Passions. Also subverted, as one of the specialties of the Masquers Guild is to alter the Corpus of customers via their knowledge of Moliate. They can provide a change of clothes, supermodel good looks, or skin as tough as armor, all if the price is fair.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> has a variant: ghosts often show the wounds that killed them and gain abilities based on the manner of their death, and appear wearing incorporeal copies of items they particularly valued in life. They don't strictly need to have had them on the body when they died, but if anyone else takes the item the ghostly version disappears - which is fully functional, even if it's a powerful magical item. This also explains why ghosts get so mad at graverobbers; they're not just desecrating bodies, they're taking the ghost's stuff.

For example, dying by fire would bring people back as red ghosts, who could set fire to objects. Death by drowning would bring people back as blue ghosts, who would leave far less dangerous, but still slightly annoying puddles around the house for others to find. Death by starvation created mooching ghosts who perpetually stole from the fridge.

Dad "always was a wrinkled old man in his heart." The spoilered character himself looks the same as at death because he only recently died, and his mind is still on the world of the living.

Goku corrects him: when he died, he not only kept the clothes he was in, he arrived on King Kai's planet wearing the weighted training clothes he'd specifically removed before his death. Once Vegeta finishes his speech, he goes off to get his clothes back.

Arguable that he can if he practiced enough. Danny's ghost outfit is an invert of a white jumpsuit he wore as a human; it switched color when he transformed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Vlad</a> got his ghost powers while he worn civilian clothes, yet he gains a white jumpsuit for his current ghostly appearance.
