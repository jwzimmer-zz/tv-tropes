For British sci-fi shows, it's "Quarry Doubling"  any desolate alien planet is usually a quarry (usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BBCQuarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BBCQuarry">BBC Quarry</a>) within a couple of hours' drive from London  or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoublingForLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoublingForLondon">Doubling for London</a>.
</p><p>One of the most famous examples of this is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> (and all subsequent series), in which every planet they land on looks exactly like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirksRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirksRock">deserts of southern California</a>, the redwood forests of Northern California, or the mountains of Central California (assuming it isn't a studio cyclorama instead). Oh, and from time to time the script might call for a beach. Any ideas?
</p><p>This is actually one of the main reasons why Hollywood and the Los Angeles area became the capital of American filmmaking.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0a2fp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0a2fp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0a2fp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The primary reason was Thomas Edison's <em>Motion Picture Patents Company</em> required filmmakers to pay exorbitant licensing fees to make films. Most did not want to pay, so they set up shop in the Los Angeles area, and if Edison's patent enforcement thugs found them, the Mexican Border was only a hundred miles away.</span> The varied locales within two or three hours drive (desert, beach, mountains, farm land), along with the consistent year-round good weather, made Southern California ideal for making movies.

The Canadian province of British Columbia, between the metropolis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vancouver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and its vast mountain forests and oceans nearby, has become the third-largest film production center in North America thanks partly to tax incentives, and its ability to stand in for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheOtherRainforest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheOtherRainforest">the Pacific Northwest</a> (usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portland">Portland</a>) or any small, rural town in the northern half of the US. You could describe the city as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojm74VGsZBU">"one giant backlot, a bunch of anonymous buildings that can stand in for anywhere else."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</p><p>Another Canadian city, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto">Toronto</a>, has doubled for cities such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a> more times than it has actually represented itself. Yet another Canadian city, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal">Montreal</a>, has usually played Francophone cities like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Paris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Paris">Paris</a> as well as American cities like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Boston">Boston</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StLouis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StLouis">St. Louis</a>, and (again) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Utah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Utah">Utah</a> has been Vulcan, Mars, and the Old West. Georgia and Louisiana have represented not just the Old South, but also modern Midwestern suburbia, northern industrial cities, and the jungles of Africa and South America. North Carolina also is known for this trope - the larger cities like Charlotte and Raleigh have portrayed Midwestern and East Coast cities while Wilmington and the Cape Fear region has stood in for almost everything under the sun. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia">Australia</a> is also a place that does this - Brisbane and Sydney have played various American cities, the more grassier rural areas of New South Wales and Queensland have doubled for the English countryside, and the Aussie outback is often used as a stunt double for locales such as the Middle East, various alien planets, and the desert parts of California. In addition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand">New Zealand</a> has been used as a stand-in for, among other places, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japan</a> and New York State. State and national governments know this, and frequently offer generous tax credits to lure film and television productions to their locales, to the point where even California itself has started <a class="urllink" href="http://deadline.com/2017/05/california-film-production-report-2016-tax-incentives-la-la-land-1202100575/">offering its own tax incentives<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to keep Hollywood filming near, well, Hollywood.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The main reason is that a production crew not only includes a cameraman, director and actors; there are usually at least two or three dozen people working on prepping a location, providing the appropriate light and transporting the equipment to film a scene. Moving everyone, especially on a weekly television budget, is sometimes implausible even if the location is willing to permit filming. Other times, the actual location is not an option for security and/or political reasons. Even in the most general sense, many cities are averse to blocking off the entire downtown for weeks on end, and so some sequences are filmed piecemeal, getting a couple vintage shots of actors near landmarks and then finding a more practical location to film the rest.
</p><p>Another time that this may be necessary is if the original location (and this is true especially for period pieces) no longer looks like what it did in story. While obviously it might be a bit difficult filming an ancient Rome in Rome itself, as the city resembles Caesar's city in name only, even the London of today is quite different from the London of Victorian times through the early part of the twentieth century (thanks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHomeFront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHomeFront">in no small part</a> to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons">Luftwaffe</a></em>). This makes some doubling in another city more valuable simply because that location actually looks more period-accurate <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ev5l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ev5l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ev5l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Görlitz, a city of less than 100,000 at the easternmost border of Saxony with Poland has stood in for numerous other cities, because it was left nearly unscathed by the war and has seen few urban planners trying to rebuild the whole thing according to their vision since</span>. Conversely, filming in a story set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesInTheFuture">Twenty Minutes In The Future</a> will have its own problems because to make a location seem futuristic would require a lot of construction and visual effects anyway.
</p><p>Of course, this can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelevisionGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelevisionGeography">Television Geography</a>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife">Misplaced Wildlife</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation">Misplaced Vegetation</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAlwaysSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAlwaysSpring">It's Always Spring</a>. In many cases, the average viewer may not be familiar with the location in question, but it can end up bugging those viewers who have been or actually <em>live</em> in those locations. Also take into account that any production wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMoney">Shoot the Money</a>, and may choose a more scenic place to film instead of the less impressive place it actually is.
</p><p>This can have a very odd effect the first time one <em>visits</em> southern California. Upon seeing for the first time those scrub-covered hills and twisty roads, one gets a truly unearthly sense of deja vu. "Have I been here before?" you ask yourself. Then you realize that you have... on TV! For those who live in southern California, it is amusing to point out places one recognizes from TV shows. The most used location is Griffith Park, whose scrabble mountains can be seen in nearly every 1950s "jungle" movie and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>.
</p><p>This can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois">The Mountains of Illinois</a> when the setting is full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Critical Research Failures</a>.
</p><p>The easiest way to subvert California Doubling is to simply have the setting actually be California (usually Los Angeles/Burbank, which is both near Hollywood and where a good chunk of the television industry is actually located). Indeed, many television shows, especially sitcoms, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokyoIsTheCenterOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokyoIsTheCenterOfTheUniverse">do exactly that</a>. And even a show that isn't <em>normally</em> set in California can have its characters go there for an episode or two; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmingLocationCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmingLocationCameo">Filming Location Cameo</a>.
</p><p>Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaDoesNotExist">Canada Does Not Exist</a>, where the shooting location actually affects the storyline.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cybergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cybergirl">Cybergirl</a></em> was set in a fictitious city named "River City", which was a very thinly-veiled version of Brisbane (the location of River City was never given).

Ironically the service was privatized some time ago, so anyone watching it on DVD now would likely not recognize it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> was filmed in Australia, but is set mostly on a fictional US island/theme park named "Spooky Island". The opening scenes not taking place on the island were also filmed here. Filming moved to Vancouver, Canada for the sequel.
</li><li> Parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SanAndreas">San Andreas</a></em> are set in California but were filmed in the Lockyer Valley just west of Brisbane, Australia.

<ul><li> The 1988 TV revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> was filmed in Brisbane, and later Melbourne. The Brisbane TV station screening the series ran a competition asking viewers to pick out the local landmarks used. (Averted in three episodes - "The Cattle King" and "The Golden Serpent" parts 1 and 2 - which <em>did</em> involve Australia!)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> filmed entirely in Australia, including Earth scenes that were supposed to be located on the Florida Space Coast. For all that the beaches are decidedly different, upper middle class tract housing can evidently be pretty similar in both places.
<ul><li> Specifically: IASA's HQ shown in "Won't Get Fooled Again" was shot in and around Sydney Olympic Park, in Homebush (a 5min drive from the studio where seasons 2-4 were shot) - ANZ stadium doubles as a launch pad (CGI rocket stuck in the middle of it) and the distinct spiral building seen several times in the background is actually part of the car park near the Acer Arena. The gardens in the "Look At The Princess" trilogy were actually the Japanese gardens in Auburn. The beach in "Scratch &amp; Sniff" was in Maroubra. The dock often seen in Crichton's dream sequences was actually right outside the industrial park in Homebush where seasons 2-4 were shot. The old gun emplacement at Middle Head doubled for several alien military encampments and ancient ruins.
</li></ul></li><li> The entirety of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePacific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePacific">The Pacific</a></em> was filmed in various locations Victoria. It doubles for everything from Guadalcanal and Pelieliu to Mobile, Alabama, and California. It's also averted when the Marines actually go to Melbourne on Liberty.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/K9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/K9">K9</a></em> was filmed in Brisbane, although the show is set in London in 2050.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> again. Filming for the movie was scheduled to finish during a break mid-Season 2, but difficulties left the Ranger cast down under longer than expected. To prevent delays for Season 2, their scenes in two three-parters ("The Wedding" and "Return of the Green Ranger") were filmed in Australia. Note, though, that "The Wedding" has a sub-plot with a school trip to Australia (which allowed for scenes making more extensive use of the area), whereas "Return of the Green Ranger" takes place in Angel Grove, California.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeTrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeTrax">Time Trax</a></em> had the hero "travelling through our world, searching for fugitives from his own," but all of this travelling was done in Australia ("Photo Finish" was a rare episode to be set there).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Films  Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> New Zealand doubled for Japan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastSamurai">The Last Samurai</a></em>; the reason being is that there wasn't any wide spaces for the battles in Japan, plus the availability of a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Taranaki">stunt double<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Mt Fuji.
<ul><li> Particularly jarring for anyone watching the first battle scene in the forest if they have lived in NZ for some time. There were just too many silver ferns around that have been taught since primary school were <em>native</em> to New Zealand.
</li></ul></li><li> New Zealand doubled for <em>Oregon</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WithoutAPaddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WithoutAPaddle">Without a Paddle</a></em> (they even had the same costumer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>!), which had forests that were simply not thick enough to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheOtherRainforest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheOtherRainforest">Pacific Northwest</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BridgeToTerabithia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BridgeToTerabithia">Bridge to Terabithia</a></em>: New Zealand as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeepSouth">The Deep South</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> trilogies were filmed almost entirely in New Zealand, a country which apparently is the closest they could find to limitless untouched landscape, save for the scenes that required a green screen. According to the DVD extras, about the only location they couldn't find was the rolling green prairies of Rohan — a slightly less-mountainous area was used instead.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson">Peter Jackson</a> also had New Zealand play California (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFrighteners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFrighteners">The Frighteners</a></em>) and New York (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005">King Kong (2005)</a></em>).
<ul><li> The Broadway hall where Carl Denham exhibits Kong to New York was played by Auckland's Civic Theatre. At the peak of the stage's proscenium arch is a winged globe with a silhouette of New Zealand clearly visible.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em>Boogeyman</em> had the US be played by New Zealand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a></em> was mostly shot in New Zealand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> was partly filmed in Wellington, New Zealand's capital city, which doubled as Hong Kong.

This is particularly odd for the former as it has a focus on baseball and you'd be hard-pressed to find anybody in New Zealand who's interested in baseball, while the latter is notable for being the only non-<em>Power Rangers</em> work for Ranger Productions Ltd.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PetesDragon2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PetesDragon2016">Pete's Dragon (2016)</a></em> was shot in New Zealand but takes place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverytownAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverytownAmerica">Everytown, America</a> setting.

New Zealand, particularly West Auckland, made a passable substitute.
<ul><li> New Zealand also doubled for China and Japan in <em>Xena</em>. Not to be mention present-day America in both series ("Yes, Virginia, There Is A Hercules" and "Deja Vu All Over Again").

<p></p><h2>Toronto Doubling</h2>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Films  Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Many Canadian genre films of the 1970s and early 1980s, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackChristmas1974" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackChristmas1974">Black Christmas</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PromNight1980" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PromNight1980">Prom Night</a></em>, would be produced with the lucrative American film market in mind, and as such would often be set in innocuous, Middle American locales while being shot in and near Toronto. Often times, this would be indicated through the presence of American paraphernalia while avoiding any direct on-screen reference to a specific location, in an effort to keep the film's setting ambiguous enough to avoid alienating any particular geographic demographic.
</li><li> <em>Equus</em> was filmed in Toronto, despite being set in England. It was made during the era of the UK/Canada tax shelter co-production, plus Richard Burton was a tax refugee from the Inland Revenue. The extras look quite Canadian, and the locations look not quite right, especially the farm and the streets. They're not completely unconvincing, but they're not quite perfect matches either. This odd feel actually adds to the film's discomforting feel. Plus extras have audible Canadian accents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em>: As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> put it, "She enrolls in Evanston Township High School  which, like all American high schools in the movies, is physically located in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Toronto">Toronto</a>."
</li><li> Another Lindsay Lohan movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConfessionsOfATeenageDramaQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConfessionsOfATeenageDramaQueen">Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen</a></em>, uses Toronto as a stand-in for many of the film's locations. In one particularly egregious scene, two characters walk by a restaurant that prominently displays the green "Pass" sign issued by the Toronto Board of Health to indicate a restaurant that passed its health standards test with flying colours.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> film (starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardNorton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardNorton">Edward Norton</a>) was shot in Toronto, doubling for Harlem, New York. The climactic rumble in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> was shot on a stretch of Yonge Street in Toronto, running from the intersection of Yonge &amp; Dundas to about a block north. The Zanzibar strip club is a dead giveaway, as are the spinning records on the side of Sam the Record Man.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShootEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShootEmUp">Shoot 'em Up</a></em> is also clearly shot in Toronto: They don't even try to hide the CN tower
</li><li> Some films shot in the Toronto area: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CinderellaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CinderellaMan">Cinderella Man</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePacifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePacifier">The Pacifier</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BulletproofMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BulletproofMonk">Bulletproof Monk</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead2004">Dawn of the Dead (2004)</a></em>. Ironically, a belated coda for <em>Dawn</em> was shot in California.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvilApocalypse">Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a></em> features several things to make Torontonians grin. Perhaps the most obvious of which is the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> nuke</span> that just so happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">explode</span> right on City Hall (the recognizable dual curved towers). Other fun features include the fact the film makers neglected to airbrush out the CN Tower, numerous logos on buildings on the Bay St. area and the Toronto Sun logo on the sides of several paperboxes.
</li><li> In the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray">Hairspray</a></em> the movie was set in Baltimore, but was filmed in Toronto. Vintage Toronto streetcars were prominent in the "Good Morning, Baltimore" opening sequence.
</li><li> You'd think a movie named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chicago">Chicago</a></em> would be shot in the eponymous city, wouldn't you? Nope, it's mostly Ontario. Naturally, this annoyed many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a> viewers. When asked what he thought of the movie <em>Chicago,</em> Mayor Daley replied, "I would have liked it better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">if it had been filmed in Chicago</a>!" To a Toronto viewer who didn't see it as a big deal, Chicago film critic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> retorted, "If a musical named '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">O Canada</a>' were currently being filmed in Chicago, how would that make you feel?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShortCircuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShortCircuit">Short Circuit</a> 2</em> was set in New York City, but obviously shot completely in Toronto and environs (including scenes at the Eaton Centre and World's Biggest Bookstore, two famous Toronto landmarks). You can even see the CN Tower in some shots if you look closely.
</li><li> An interesting side-effect of Toronto doubling is that there's a certain amount of spill-over to Hamilton, a city that has a certain level of industrial grunge that Toronto proper lacks. Various scenes in, for example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> movie mentioned above, were actually filmed there instead of Toronto. Basically, Hamilton is doubling (tripling?) for Toronto in these cases.
</li><li> Toronto stands in for Boston a few times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodWillHunting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodWillHunting">Good Will Hunting</a></em>, but it was shot primarily in Massachusetts, and most of the Toronto scenes were interiors (U of T dorm rooms, local bars, the novelty shop etc).
</li><li> Likewise, the Santiago Calatrava-designed galleria at BCE place appears in a number of science fiction films, notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gattaca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gattaca">Gattaca</a></em>.
</li><li> ...and the distinctive curved City Hall buildings that appear in Toronto's flag appear time and again as futuristic government, military, or corporate buildings in a host of different science fiction films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1">X-Men</a></em> was primarily filmed there. For instance, the mansion interior was filmed in Casa Loma, a Toronto landmark.
</li><li> The movie <em>Don't Say a Word</em> was filmed in an abandoned subway station in Toronto filling in for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> station. The station (Lower Bay) has filled in for NYC and Chicago stations so many times that the Toronto Transit Commission asked that the movie set be donated to them, giving them a selling point for future location shoots.
</li><li> In <em>Score! A Hockey Musical</em>, the establishing shot of the Brampton Blades' home arena is actually a shot of the Port Credit Arena in Mississauga, Ontario (which makes this a case of California Doubling between two Canadian municipalities!).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoondockSaints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoondockSaints">The Boondock Saints</a></em>: Both films were made in Toronto, with the exception of overhead establishing shots in Boston. The CN Tower can be seen, as well as a Toronto Dominion bank.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em> had both Hamilton and Toronto double for New York. Badly (as many instances of Canadian road signs, flags and trademarks still appear often).
<ul><li> When Kick-Ass and Red Mist first meet, as they drive along in the Mist Mobile it is clearly Yonge Street. They drive past HMV's Flagship store, the Eaton Centre, a <em>Toronto Sun</em> newspaper box and Sam the Record Man (unlike in the above mentioned Hulk, however, the records are not lit).
</li><li> This is again obvious in the sequel: when Kick-Ass and Dr. Gravity are ambushed the first time they go on patrol together, they are across the street from a Mr. Sub, a submarine sandwich shop found solely in Canada.
</li><li> In the scene where The Motherfucker robs the convenience store the street sign reads "Grosvenor St", the actual scene taking place at the intersection of Yonge and Grosvenor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Red" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Red">Red</a></em> had Toronto double for many major cities (such as New York, Chicago, Washington and Cleveland) while New Orleans doubled for several cities as well (such as Kansas City).
<ul><li> Stanton's speech and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ensuing raid</span> are all shot in various parts of the Royal York Hotel in Toronto; Victoria's limo even lets her out in front of Toronto's Union Station.
</li><li> In the 2003 Bollywood film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KalHoNaHo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KalHoNaHo">Kal Ho Na Ho</a></em> the majority of the film is set in New York, specifically in Brooklyn. But the majority of the sequences were filmed in Toronto, poorly albeit, since Canadian flags, signs, and Ontario license plates can be visible. It might annoy New Yorkers, eagle eyed film enthusiasts and those who expect doubling to be done correctly. However, the Indian audiences did not notice this as California Doubling is not a commonly used concept in Indian film and media.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nikita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nikita">Nikita</a></em> was mainly filmed in Toronto and the surrounding Ontario area, which doubled for a very wide variety of locales, including New York City, rural New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Quebec, Russia, Belarus, China, Mexico, the Netherlands, and many more.
</li><li> Cop procedural <em>Night Heat</em> filmed in Toronto and took place in a generic American city.
</li><li> The short-lived action show <em>FX: The Series</em> doubled for New York.
</li><li> The Canadian TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth">Due South</a></em>, although ostensibly set in Chicago, was mainly filmed in Toronto. While most of the first two seasons featured establishing shots of the Chicago area, the distinction of scenes shot at recognizable Toronto landmarks became more noticeable in the last two seasons (on the other hand, the episode where the characters go to Toronto was filmed in... Chicago). The streetcar tracks are a dead giveaway in just about every exterior scene, as Chicago doesn't have street-running trolleys anymore. Not to mention the periodic occurrence of street signs saying things like "Centre Street".
</li><li> <em>Tracker</em> was filmed in Toronto while being set in Chicago.

</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> used the California Doubling For Itself variant for the most part, season 1 was filmed in Canada. The pilot was filmed in Vancouver, but the rest of the season was filmed in Toronto. Starting in season 2, the filming all moved to Los Angeles. One difference that results is that the police station set and the set for Monk's apartment change significantly.

</li><li> The art deco facade of the R. C.

Then again, none of the movies were actually filmed in Detroit, either.
</li><li> The American version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em> was filmed in Toronto with the setting left ambiguous so American viewers could imagine it in their city. Unfortunately, they didn't bother to cover up some local signage on bus stops.
</li><li> The pilot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgainstTheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgainstTheWall">Against the Wall</a></em> opened with loads of footage of some of the most famous Chicago landmarks (with "Sweet Home Chicago" playing in the background). But once the music stopped, it quickly became clear that most of the show was filmed in Toronto (aside from occasional uses of stock footage). During the pilot, the crew took the trouble of replicating Chicago Tribune newspaper boxes but didn't bother to disguise the street signs. Streetcar tracks are visible in a few downtown scenes, and the 'L' train tracks are noticeably absent (save for aforementioned stock footage).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em> is filmed in Toronto and the surrounding area, and they barely attempt to hide it. In the third season finale, there is a Valu-Mart which is supposed to be in Elk Ridge, South Dakota. Valu-Mart is a grocery store that doesn't exist outside of Canada at all. Union Station in Toronto doubled for Geneva, Switzerland in the second season premiere as well.
<ul><li> Not to mention the first season episode set in Chicago, even though streetcar tracks and a street sign for York Avenue (neither of which exist in Chicago) are visible.
</li><li> There's a later episode with scenes set in Victorian London which is filmed in Toronto's historic <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillery_District">Distillery District<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This looks fairly authentic, since most buildings in the Distillery District are from the Victorian Era... except for the inclusion of a very (North) American-style street clock on a pole.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wonderfalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wonderfalls">Wonderfalls</a></em> Toronto and environs double for upstate New York. Scenes in which the falls are actually visible are shot on the Canadian side - in some scenes the American Falls are clearly visible on the <em>opposite</em> bank, while the Horseshoe (Canadian) Falls are on the right, not the left.
</li><li> Toronto doubles for Los Angeles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLAComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLAComplex">The L.A. Complex</a></em> with a mix of location-shot establishing shots and yellow filters to make the sun look brighter.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Shadowhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Shadowhunters">Shadowhunters</a></em> is set in New York but is filmed exclusively in Toronto.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheStrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheStrain">The Strain</a></em> is filmed in the Toronto area; one of the most blatantly obvious examples is a scene in Season 1 that clearly has the interior of Toronto's Union Station doubling (poorly) for New York City's Grand Central Station. In season 2, the exterior is used to double for the streets of Washington D.C. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2k43o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2k43o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2k43o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This time, however, the doubling is really only obvious if you are intimately familiar with the geography with one or both of the involved cities.</span>

Averted for several other cities like Seoul, South Korea and Johannesburg, South Africa, which were shot on-location.
</li><li> In the Poirot TV film, <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, scenes that were supposed to be in the French countryside were actually shot on the preserved Nene Valley Railway near Peterborough, England.
<ul><li> The location is also used in a surprising amount of British period shows/films that involve railways in some way, Wansford Station having doubled as many fictional ones due to it still having the (now unused) old station buildings and a number of steam and diesel engines on location.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavensGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavensGate">Heaven's Gate</a></em> showed the characters graduating from Harvard. Director Michael Cimino couldn't get permission to film at Harvard University itself. So he decided to film the scene at Oxford University in England despite that fact that Oxford looks nothing like Harvard.

The biggest evidence of this is a scene where Inspector Clouseau runs through a room, out the window and into the Seine — which was just a large tank filled with thousands of gallons of water.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PokemonDetectivePikachu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PokemonDetectivePikachu">Pokémon Detective Pikachu</a></em> primarily uses real locations in London for the fictional Ryme City, modified with props and CGI to make them look like a part of the Pokémon universe. (As a side effect, this means cars in Ryme City drive on the left.) A lot of outdoor scenes outside the city limits were filmed in the Scottish Highlands, including Glen Nevis.

In films Dublin has also doubled for Liverpool (<em>Educating Rita</em> and <em>An Awfully Big Adventure</em>), London (<em>Peaches</em>) and Boston (<em>Far and Away</em>).
</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>By Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Romantic comedy-drama <em>Cold Feet</em> was set in a smart suburb of London; external filming was actually done in Stockport, a town two hundred miles away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">Oop North</a>, whose smarter residential suburb of Heaton Moor was held to be a good double for the sort of London the characters lived in. The advantages for a London based TV company probably boiled down to it being much cheaper, with less traffic, on a main railway line out of London, and evolved enough (by the primitive standards of the north of England) to have a couple of very nice coffee shops and eateries - home from home, in fact.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DalzielAndPascoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DalzielAndPascoe">Dalziel and Pascoe</a>": Set in Yorkshire, but produced by the BBC's Pebble Mill Studio's in Birmingham (which did a lot of BBC dramas and Current Affairs in the 90's). As a result various places in the Midlands ended up standing in for Yorkshire, and the Cotswolds playing the part of the Yorkshire Dales, probably because it was only a hour's drive away as suppose to a three hour one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DocMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DocMartin">Doc Martin</a></em>: The fictional Portwenn is played by Cornish village Port Isaac.

<ul><li> The ever-dependable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BBCQuarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BBCQuarry">BBC Quarry</a> somewhere in England or Wales, doubling for an alien planet or rocky desert, was a filming staple in the classic era of the show.

</li><li> As the new series is being produced by BBC Wales, Cardiff has California doubled for London several times. Cardiff quayside is nearly always the setting for any urban filming.
</li><li> Ironically, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E3TheUnquietDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E3TheUnquietDead">"The Unquiet Dead"</a>, Victorian Cardiff was California Doubled by Swansea, a smaller city nearby  this was due to Cardiff being heavily bombed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, so not many Victorian buildings survived.

</li><li> 2012 Christmas special "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2012CSTheSnowmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2012CSTheSnowmen">The Snowmen</a>" had various parts of the 19th century old town in Bristol stand in for parts of 1890s London. This was both due to the more convenient distance and due to the fact that most of contemporary London lacks the late-Victorian street look and even continuity of Victorian buildings that Bristol still has in a few places.
</li><li> Bafflingly enough, Series 6's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E1TheImpossibleAstronaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E1TheImpossibleAstronaut">The Impossible Astronaut</a>" had its Utah diner scenes filmed at Eddie's American Diner in Cardiff. Since then, it has (understandably) become a tourist hotspot for Whovians, and has had its bathroom doors painted to resemble a TARDIS. To the surprise of everyone, that same diner interior makes a comeback in Series 9, though its true nature (and why its exterior shots are now set in Nevada instead) is not what anyone was expecting.
</li><li> Some of Series 8's coastal or beach scenes (which occur in a few episodes) were filmed at different parts of the Welsh coastline. Funnily enough, one of these beaches is supposed to be located on an alien planet colonised by humans in the future. One Bristol-centric episode set in the present day was mostly filmed there, but has railway-related scenes that were shot elsewhere in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWestCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWestCountry">The West Country</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFastShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFastShow">The Fast Show</a></em> in the Shore Leave sketch. The sailors start singing that they are in New York in what is clearly Newcastle.
</li><li> A quarry in Cornwall played the planet Magrathea in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHitchHikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHitchHikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUK">House of Cards (UK)</a></em> indulged in doubling, using Manchester Town Hall for The Houses of Parliament internal shots. This was half because the town hall was designed to be a perfect replica of parliament in some areas, and partially because getting permits and time to film in the actual parliament buildings is problematic at best.
</li><li> Double subverted on one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">James May's</a> Toy Stories</em>, where James tries to fly a balsawood toy glider across the English channel. Due to international flight regulations, he has to settle for flying the equivalent distance across the sea from England to Wales instead, and briefly discusses having some Welshmen dress up in mustaches and accordions. When <em>that</em> flight fails due to weather conditions, he instead - successfully - flies it from the English coast to the island of Lundy, which he renames Llundy to make it sound more Welsh.
</li><li> Fun with <em>Morse</em> - see if you can spot the real Oxford locations (usually the famous bits) and which are Stevenage in North Herts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinOfSherwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinOfSherwood">Robin of Sherwood</a></em> England doubled for England, just not the same bits of it. Sherwood Forest was mostly represented by a wood outside Bristol, Nottingham Castle by various northern castles and Wells Cathedral, and other locations were scattered across the country, mostly in the north and west.
</li><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> is also produced by BBC Wales, Cardiff has doubled for parts of London in that show as well. However, location shoots requiring distinct London or Devonshire scenery were shot in the corresponding places, averting this trope. (The Devonshire village seen in one episode is still actually Welsh, though.)
</li><li> One of the "Discoverers" sketches in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMitchellAndWebbLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMitchellAndWebbLook">That Mitchell and Webb Look</a></em> has the captain and his first mate land on the shores of Australia... given the nature of the show, the sheer flagrancy of the doubling makes it all the funnier when you have one of the most iconically British landmarks in the background, viz, <em>the cliffs of Dover</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTomorrowPeople1973" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTomorrowPeople1973">The Tomorrow People (1973)</a></em>: "Worlds Away", on arriving for the first time on an alien planet, one character warns the others, "This isn't just some wood in Surrey," which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> by the writers — the scene was indeed filmed in a wood in the British county of Surrey.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlindSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlindSide">The Blind Side</a></em> is set in Memphis, Tennessee but was filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, Georgia.
</li><li> Most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> movies, starting with the 2014 production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1">Ant-Man</a></em>, have been filmed at Pinewood Studios in Fayette County, GA (about 20 miles south of Atlanta). Anything that isn't filmed in the studio itself is done in various locations in the Atlanta area. The downtown area stands in for NYC, Piedmont Park for Central Park, and the Avengers' headquarters (at least the exterior) is part of Porsche's (as in the automobile) North American headquarters just south of the city. They film some on actual locations, but the bulk of it is done in Atlanta.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>, the scenes set in Lagos, Nigeria, were shot in Atlanta, Georgia.

One of the college tour scenes was filmed in Sanford Stadium with UGA's "G" logo visible on the field.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NowAndThen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NowAndThen">Now and Then</a></em> was set in Indiana, but shot entirely in Georgia in Savannah and Statesboro.

<ul><li> The series was filmed in Atlanta, and the show partially averts the trope by having three episodes set in Atlanta proper. "A Feast of Friends" in particular prominently features two Atlanta landmarks, the Fernbank Museum of Natural History and the Fox Theatre.
</li><li> However, Constantine, Chas, and Zed go all around the United States, and one point, Mexico, to quell paranormal activity, and for every location outside Atlanta, the show plays the trope straight.
</li><li> The Ford Buildings on the campus of Berry College in northwest Georgia doubled for Ravenscar Asylum in Northern England. The exterior shots of Constantine's millhouse hideout were also filmed on the campus of Berry College.

Notably, the choice of setting was motivated by this trope. It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">originally titled</a> <em>Montauk</em> and set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkState">the real-life Long Island town of that name</a>, with the setting meant to have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Amity Island</a> feel to it. However, their budget didn't allow them to film in a location that could double for that sort of Northeastern coastal town, while suburban Georgia, with that state's generous tax breaks, could easily double for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmblinEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmblinEntertainment">Amblin-esque</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverytownAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverytownAmerica">Everytown, America</a> setting.
</li><li> The largely vacant Gwinnett Place Mall in Duluth, Georgia doubles as the Starcourt Mall in Season 3 with several period-accurate storefronts. Incidentally, Gwinnett Place actually opened in 1984, lending further credence to the show's 80s setting.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleSweetheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleSweetheart">Little Sweetheart</a></em> is based off of a book set in France, is a UK film with mostly American actors, was filmed in Florida and is set in Texas. Why they didn't just set it in Florida, seeing as they used an entire real Florida town, is beyond us.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams">Field of Dreams</a></em> has Dubuque, Iowa filling in for most of non-Fenway Park Boston, and Galena, Illinois filling in for Chisholm, Minnesota, both being within a 50-mile radius of the farm that served as the Kinsella home.
</li><li> The film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HelloDolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HelloDolly">Hello, Dolly!</a></em> used Garrison, New York as 1890s-era Yonkers. Many of the buildings they redecorated for the film are still there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyGame">Spy Game</a></em> had segments set in Beirut and Vietnam which were both filmed in Morocco. Likewise, Budapest stood in for Berlin, and Oxford, England became Suzhou, China.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigGame">Big Game</a></em>, despite being made by Finns, has Bavaria doubling for Finland, as it has plot-important mountains and woodlands real-life Finland notoriously lacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ColdMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ColdMountain">Cold Mountain</a></em> was filmed in Romania but set in Western North Carolina. The director stated that the reason for shooting there was a lack of old growth forests and period buildings in WNC. It could also have been the prevalence of cell towers in the area.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TermsOfEndearment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TermsOfEndearment">Terms of Endearment</a>:</em> Some scenes set in Texas were actually filmed in Lincoln, Nebraska where the bulk of the film is set.
<ul><li> In addition, the scene where the station wagon crosses the "Texas State Line" was actually filmed just outside Cortland, NE.

(While there are L trains in the Big Apple, they're all located in the less-photogenic outer boroughs rather than in Manhattan.) Really, only the overhead shots were filmed in Chicago — most of the rest was CGI.
</li><li> The Sandman Chase in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3">Spider-Man 3</a></em> was done in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland">Cleveland</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></em>, Cuba is actually Puerto Rico, the Russian dam from the opening is in Switzerland, and many St. Petersburg externals are in London. The train scenes were filmed on the Nene Valley Railway in Cambridgeshire, also the scene of filming for the circus train scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Octopussy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Octopussy">Octopussy</a></em>.
</li><li> The 2020 Netflix original film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Extraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Extraction">Extraction</a></em> starring Chris Hemsworth has Mumbai, India; Ahmedabad, India; and Bangkok, Thailand doubling for the movies setting of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a></em> features Piz Gloria. A mountain that is implied to be set in St. Moritz, Switzerland if the novel is taken into account. However, the mountain and surrounding areas were actually shot in Murren (which is in the same country). Additionally, the bobsled run (now a ski run) that Bond chases Blofeld down near the end is a few miles away from the real Piz Gloria, so jumping out of the building and rolling down the hill to end up at it is impossible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies">Tomorrow Never Dies</a></em> is partially set in Vietnam, but given the Vietnamese authorities vetoed shortly before filming, the crew actually filmed in Thailand (some scenes even denounce the backgrounds are the same as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun">The Man with the Golden Gun</a></em>).

</li><li> Most subaquatic scenes since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball">Thunderball</a></em> were shot in the Bahamas (doubling for the Adriatic, Mediterranean and Caspian Seas).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay">Die Another Day</a></em>: North Korea and Cuba are communist nations who understandably wouldn't want to be involved with the Cold Warrior, so they used Hawaii and Cornwall for the former and Spain for the latter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever">Diamonds Are Forever</a></em> mostly averts this as a good chunk of it was actually filmed in Las Vegas. However the scene where Bond is riding the elevator to Whyte's penthouse was filmed in Pinewood Studios. And the first scene with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys">Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd</a> which took place in the South African desert was shot within the Vegas city limits.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Defiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Defiance">Defiance</a></em> (the Daniel Craig Holocaust movie) is mostly shot in Eastern Europe relatively close to the area of Belarus where its set. However parts of the movie are also set in rural Manitoba, Canada and local plant life like red willow and Manitoba hardy roses are visible in many shots. Interestingly one of the reason the region was initially settled by a lot of Eastern European immigrants is that it apparently looked a lot like home to them as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RulesOfEngagement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RulesOfEngagement">Rules of Engagement</a></em> has a few scenes set in the fern-filled jungles of Vietnam. The film was shot in Morocco, Virginia, and South Carolina.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serena">Serena</a></em> is set in the Smoky Mountains, but was filmed in the Czech Republic.

<ul><li> <em>Indiana Jones</em> does this a lot. Egypt from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> was really Tunisia, the primary shooting location for Tatooine in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> original trilogy (the canyon where Indy threatens Belloq is the same location where R2-D2 was taken by Jawas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></em> is set in India, but shot in Sri Lanka, due to both the locations being very apart in India (but close to each other in the island) and the Indian government getting offended by their portrayal. The first act of <em>Temple of Doom</em>, set in 1935 Shanghai, was filmed in Macau.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>A Perfect Getaway</em>, Hawaii is played by Puerto Rico. The nutty part is that the area of Hawaii being replicated <em>is the above area that doubles for everywhere else</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon3">Lethal Weapon 3</a></em> averts it with the first scene, the car bomb scene, by filming the outdoor shots for the scene in Orlando, Florida. The building that was destroyed, the ICSI Building, was actually Orlando's old City Hall. They put a Coca-Cola sign on the new City Hall. They also cast the city's mayor at the time, Bill Frederick, as "Policeman who says 'Bravo' after explosion".
<ul><li> And the building that was destroyed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> was located in St. Petersburg, Florida.
</li></ul></li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DogSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DogSoldiers">Dog Soldiers</a></em> featured Luxembourg doubling for the Highlands of Scotland.
</li><li> Inverted in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Crash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Crash">Crash</a></em>, which was set in LA, but filmed many of its exterior shots in <em>Germany</em> because it was German-financed. There's also a short-lived <em>Crash</em> series, which continued the tradition by using Albuquerque for LA.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMachinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMachinist">The Machinist</a></em> was set in LA, but filmed in Barcelona, because it was made with Spanish money. This, by the way, is why the film's title is in Spanish on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDB">IMDB</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneUltimatum">The Bourne Ultimatum</a></em> had a scene set in Moscow during the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSupremacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSupremacy">The Bourne Supremacy</a></em> (which was filmed in Moscow during that film). To avoid having to get an entire crew to Moscow again, they created a snowy Moscow in East Berlin, which was mostly rebuilt by Stalin and so looked much like the architecture of Moscow.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maverick">Maverick</a></em>, the climactic poker game is set on a riverboat steaming the Mississippi River south of St. Louis. Anyone familiar with the area knows that the exterior scenes of the riverboat were shot somewhere very, very different from the Mississippi River south of St. Louis (probably on a river in the Pacific Northwest).
<ul><li> Not to mention the bizarre detour through <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park">Yosemite National Park<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Seriously, the scene takes place right under Half Dome.
</li><li> Yosemite National Park also stood in for the Himalayas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Philippines doubled for Vietnam in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow">Apocalypse Now</a></em> and a biker film called <em>The Losers</em>.
<ul><li> This is a particular favorite country for a lot of low-budget Hong Kong movies to double for the US and other countries due to the different kinds of urban cities, beaches and deep jungles.
</li></ul></li><li> The Philippines also doubled for Thailand in <em>Brokedown Palace</em>.
</li><li> Conversely, while most of the film was shot in the Philippines, the Australian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTV">Made-for-TV</a> drama film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ADangerousLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ADangerousLife">A Dangerous Life</a></em> has some of its scenes shot in Sri Lanka and Australia largely due to legal and political pressure from Juan Ponce Enrile who took umbrage to the way he was portrayed in the film.
</li><li> In a reversal of the trope's namesake, <em>Revenge of the Ninja</em> takes place in Los Angeles, but is filmed in Salt Lake City, Utah and looks nothing like Los Angeles.
</li><li> For rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand">obvious reasons</a>, Moscow has often been California Doubled, for example by Vienna in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Firefox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Firefox">Firefox</a></em>.
<ul><li> Vienna also doubled for Bratislava in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLivingDaylights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLivingDaylights">The Living Daylights</a></em> for much the same reason.
</li><li> Helsinki, Finland also has a reputation as standing in for Moscow in many American films, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082979/">Reds<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GorkyPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GorkyPark">Gorky Park</a></em>.
<ul><li> Sort of averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedHeat">Red Heat</a></em> - Budapest (another one!) played Moscow for most of the movie, but the footage behind the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf_3QeDwDS0">opening (contains nudity and violence; credits start at 4:39)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oYAuJlS-vM">closing credits (from the 4:21 mark)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> really was shot there.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorZhivago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorZhivago">Doctor Zhivago</a></em> was shot with different Spanish locations (especially in the province of Soria) standing for Siberia. Soria, as well as among others <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Pedriza">La Pedriza<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Encantada">La Ciudad Encantada<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, have also doubled as Cimmeria in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheBarbarian1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheBarbarian1982">Conan the Barbarian (1982)</a></em> movie.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the makers of <em>Doctor Zhivago</em> actually tried to get permission to film in the Soviet Union. You wouldn't think they'd have bothered, seeing how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorZhivago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorZhivago">the original novel</a> was already banned in the Soviet Union, but maybe they wanted to be sure.
</li></ul></li><li> The producers of <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em> scouted locations across Eastern Europe but finally settled on Yugoslavia (largely because they couldn't get permission to film in other countries).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em> was filmed in Italy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUnbearableLightnessOfBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUnbearableLightnessOfBeing">The Unbearable Lightness of Being</a></em>, set in the Prague Spring, was filmed in France and Switzerland as communist Czechoslovakia still existed at the time. Ironically, the Czech Republic would later become a frequent target of this trope.
</li><li> A rare, pre-<em>glasnost</em> exception is a 1976 adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBlueBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBlueBird">The Blue Bird</a></em>, which was the first ever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternationalCoproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternationalCoproduction">International Coproduction</a> between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. The movie was filmed in English, on location in Moscow and Leningrad (present-day St. Petersburg). It was quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> due to the language and culture barriers. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneFonda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneFonda">Jane Fonda</a> annoyed the Russian crew by following them around and constantly talking about communism. To add insult to the injury, the film bombed disastrously at the box office.
</li><li> This was inverted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amadeus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amadeus">Amadeus</a></em>, which is set in Vienna, but was filmed in Prague. This is because the film is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece">Period Piece</a> and Prague was somewhat behind the times due to the wonders of communism.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKiteRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKiteRunner">The Kite Runner</a></em> filmed in Kashgar, China for Afghanistan; <em>The Power of One</em> filmed in Zimbabwe for South Africa (this was before the fall of apartheid); Thailand has been used for Burma, Cambodia and Vietnam; Malaysia was used for Thailand in <em>Anna and the King</em>. And movies set in Tibet have been filmed in the mountains of Argentina and Morocco.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a Russian reversal of the trope. In the USSR, films set in Western European cities were filmed in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Western Ukraine (which have a lot of Gothic and Baroque architecture). Films about the Middle East used Central Asia or Azerbaijan as stand-ins. However, the most glorious example is the Crimean peninsula, with its uniquely diverse natural and cultural landscape. It was, and still is, a perennial favourite of Soviet/Russian film crews and stood for almost <em>everything under the sun</em>; in fact, in Russia the trope would have been named "Crimea Doubling".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder">Tropic Thunder</a></em> was shot almost entirely in Hawaii, despite being set in Vietnam (or at least around the South-East Asian area).
<ul><li> It's just a location playing a location disguised as another location.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> movie filmed scenes set in the Middle East in the White Sands military bombing range, in New Mexico, once again for fairly obvious reasons.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></em>'s climactic battle in Egypt was also filmed at White Sands. The opening scene set in an industrial area of Shanghai was filmed at the former Bethlehem Steel plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The forest battle, which according to <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Pine_Barrens">TFWiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was fought in the Pine Barrens in New Jersey (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Barrens_(New_Jersey)">a rather flat area<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), was filmed in Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersDarkOfTheMoon">Transformers: Dark of the Moon</a></em> had Chicago, aside from portraying itself, double for Sam's apartment in Washington D.C. The Chernobyl scenes were filmed around northwest Indiana (again, for obvious reasons), while Detroit stood in for some scenes in Chicago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersAgeOfExtinction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersAgeOfExtinction">Transformers: Age of Extinction</a></em> has Michigan and Chicago doubling for China (though production actually filmed there later).
</li></ul></li><li> The outdoors scenes of Los Angeles in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990">Total Recall</a></em> were actually Mexico City; ostensibly because the design, cleanliness and architecture of Mexico City's subway stations have a futuristic look to them. Many other exterior shots were filmed in public roadways and plazas. The rest of the movie was filmed in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estudios_Churubusco">Estudios Churubusco<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> soundstages.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall2012">The 2012 film</a> on the other hand was obviously filmed in Toronto. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the subway at one point is supposed to be the London Underground, but is blatantly the Toronto subway system.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForRicherOrPoorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForRicherOrPoorer">For Richer or Poorer</a></em> was the first in a growing number of Baltimore Doubling instances. Notably outrageous though, as the much of the movie takes place in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which is not that far from where the film was actually shot.
</li><li> Parts of the Czech Republic and Poland often double for parts of Austria or Germany. They stick up German language street and shop signs.
<ul><li> Prague and some other parts of the Czech Republic apparently also stood in for Paris and France in general in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesMiserables1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesMiserables1998">Les Misérables (1998)</a></em>.
</li><li> The first two live-action <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChroniclesOfNarnia">Chronicles Of Narnia</a></em> films were filmed in predominately Czech Republic and Poland, with some work being done in Slovenia and New Zealand as well.
</li><li> Nearly all scenes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Eurotrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Eurotrip">EuroTrip</a></em> were filmed in or near Prague. No scene was set in the Czech Republic itself, though Slovakia, which was unified with it as Czechoslovakia until 1993, is featured.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern">Spaghetti Westerns</a> were filmed with a variety of European locations doubling for the American West. The semidesertic province of Almería in Spain, with its wide-open spaces that evoked an untamed frontier (and extras who could more or less pass for Mexican), was probably the most common.
<ul><li> Some movies of the same genre as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy">Dollars Trilogy</a></em> were <a class="urllink" href="https://elpais.com/ccaa/2012/01/06/madrid/1325886951_372231.html">filmed (link in Spanish)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in other places of Spain as the provinces of Madrid and Burgos as much if not more than in Almería.
</li><li> Seeing typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation">Mediterranean vegetation</a> on typical <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst">karst<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> rocks in what is supposed to be wild west or Mexico is quite amusing (<em>"Wait a minute! This could actually be that hill where we use to go to weekend trips."</em>).
</li><li> The same location was used as well in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungIndianaJonesChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungIndianaJonesChronicles">prequel TV series</a>, standing for Greece, the Hatay republic (now in Turkey), Egypt and Mexico. The Mexican episode was later recut and released as a TV movie with additional scenes in the American SW that were <em>really</em> filmed in the American SW, and it is quite amusing to see how the vegetation and terrain suddenly change as soon as the main character crosses the frontier. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrassIsGreener" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrassIsGreener">Grass Is Greener</a> here indeed...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em> was also partially filmed in Spain, in addition to Morocco and Jordan. Only Jordan lies in the region the film is depicting.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the most egregious examples was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleOfTheBulge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleOfTheBulge">Battle of the Bulge</a></em> being filmed in Spain - in particular, the flat, arid, sunny, relatively tree-free part. Note that the actual Battle occurred in the Ardennes - which is hilly and heavily forested - during winter.
</li><li> Many historical films in the 60s and 70s were filmed in Spain - including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChimesAtMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChimesAtMidnight">Chimes at Midnight</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeMusketeers1973" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeMusketeers1973">The Three Musketeers (1973)</a></em> - because the labor was cheap, the terrain was varied, and, frankly, Franco's government was incredibly receptive to bribery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeparted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeparted">The Departed</a></em> is an odd example. It's set in Boston, and some scenes (two weeks' worth) were filmed there, but the majority was filmed in New York. Due to the success of the film, one of the first bills signed into law by Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick was the creation of a massive (25%) tax credit for filmmaking in the Commonwealth. Subsequent films set in Boston, including Ben Affleck's first two movies as a director, have thus been filmed in Boston.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBridgeOnTheRiverKwai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBridgeOnTheRiverKwai">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a></em> is set in Thailand, but was filmed in Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), a distinction the publicity of the time didn't see fit to make clear. Instead, it raved about the movie being shot in Ceylon in a way which implied the real-life River Kwai was located there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSearchers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSearchers">The Searchers</a></em> made spectacular use of Utah's Monument Valley. These scenes were supposed to be set in Texas.
<ul><li> Most of John Ford's Westerns were shot in Monument Valley, including the Cavalry Trilogy, which was set mostly in Arizona, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CheyenneAutumn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CheyenneAutumn">Cheyenne Autumn</a></em>, which took place in Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Utah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Utah">Utah</a> has doubled for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">Old West</a> in too many movies to count, for the state of Nevada in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em>, the state of Oklahoma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Footloose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Footloose">Footloose</a></em>, Vulcan in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em> and as Mars in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnCarter">John Carter</a></em>. Salt Lake City has been cast as a generic American city many times, most notably in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TouchedByAnAngel">Touched by an Angel</a></em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Albuquerque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Albuquerque">Albuquerque</a>, NM in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical">High School Musical</a></em> series.
<ul><li> Goblin Valley State Park doubled as the alien planet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest">Galaxy Quest</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeMyselfAndIrene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeMyselfAndIrene">Me, Myself &amp; Irene</a></em>, set in Rhode Island, was at least partially filmed in Vermont.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Doomsday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Doomsday">Doomsday</a></em> uses mostly South Africa to stand in for post-apocalyptic Scotland.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RoboCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RoboCop">RoboCop</a></em> takes place in Detroit, but none of the movies were actually made there. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop1987">The first</a> was made in Dallas, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2">the second</a> in Houston, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop3">the third</a> in Atlanta. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2014">The 2014 remake</a> only has establishing plates shot in Detroit, with primary locations in Toronto.
</li><li> <em>Did You Hear About The Morgans?</em> is about a couple who are put into the Witness Protection Program and sent to Wyoming, which is actually New Mexico subbing for Wyoming. I guess they didn't want to be accused of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InPlainSight">copying</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www1.skicanadianrockies.com/alberta-winter-stories/hollywood-comes-to-alberta/explore-hollywood-in-alberta.html">Rural Alberta<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has doubled for a number of outdoor locations, depending on the particular area, with the Badlands of southern Alberta being used for numerous Westerns over the years. Famous examples include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain">Brokeback Mountain</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShanghaiNoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShanghaiNoon">Shanghai Noon</a></em>.
</li><li> Similar to Alberta above, Winnipeg has found itself to be an excellent substitute locale for a number of other places, frequently Chicago.
<ul><li> The 2004 remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShallWeDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShallWeDance">Shall We Dance?</a></em> was filmed here, going so far as using the legislative building's <em>bathrooms</em> for a scene. (Hey, they look nice!)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAssassinationOfJesseJamesByTheCowardRobertFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAssassinationOfJesseJamesByTheCowardRobertFord">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a></em>, despite being from The Old West, was filmed in Winnipeg's Exchange district (which looks sufficiently old, for that matter).
</li><li> One of the funniest examples is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBigFatGreekWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBigFatGreekWedding">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a></em>, which was born of a one-woman play written by and starring Nia Vardalos, a Winnipeg native, set in Winnipeg, about her wedding (in Winnipeg) and her crazy (Winnipeg-based) family, was filmed in Winnipeg, with many Winnipeg landmarks frequently visible, and all the extras (save her real-life husband Ian Gomez) being Winnipeg natives... and the movie was set in Chicago, because apparently an American audience needed an American city to enjoy the movie.
</li><li> On the other hand, Hamilton and Brantford doubled for Winnipeg in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTraceyFragments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTraceyFragments">The Tracey Fragments</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Munich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Munich">Munich</a></em>, scenes set in Tel Aviv, Beirut, Cyprus, Athens and Rome where filmed at Malta, and scenes set in London, Rome, Paris, New York City and a German airport were filmed in Budapest.
</li><li> Speaking of Malta, it was used for Rome (well, the Colosseum) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gladiator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gladiator">Gladiator</a></em>. Additionally, a forest in England was used for the opening battle in Germania and Maximus' first gladiator battles were fought in Morocco.
</li><li> Practically any movie set in the Middle East is filmed in Morocco for political and security reasons. In addition to ancient or medieval history films, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackHawkDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackHawkDown">Black Hawk Down</a></em> has used Morocco to double for war-torn Somalia.
</li><li> Virginia has done its of doubling as well, both for itself and for other parts of the Eastern US:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepImpact">Deep Impact</a></em>, the traffic jam of people leaving Virginia Beach was actually shot on a newly-built freeway <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3gyeg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3gyeg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3gyeg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">specifically VA 234/Prince William Parkway between VA 28 and I-66</span> in Manassas, 150 miles away. The terrain is the giveaway; Virginia Beach is on the Atlantic Plain and almost perfectly flat, while Manassas (like most of the DC area north and west of town) is on the not-so-flat Appalachian Piedmont.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvanAlmighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvanAlmighty">Evan Almighty</a></em>, the village of Crozet (about 10 miles from Charlottesville) doubled for the much more urban Northern Virginia suburbs.
</li><li> A good chunk of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing">Dirty Dancing</a></em> was shot at the Mountain Lake Hotel near Roanoke. The movie was set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorschtBelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorschtBelt">the Catskills</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, but since most of the actual Catskills resorts had shut down (or were in no shape to shoot a movie) by then (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">1987</a>), another location had to be found.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em> took place in the fictional Gotham City, of course, but clearly were filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>. To the extent that some fans take it for granted that Gotham City <em>is</em> the Nolanverse's equivalent of Chicago. Much of the first film was also filmed in England (the fields surrounding Wayne Manor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and what's left of it after it's burned down</span> are clearly not in the US).
<ul><li> Chicago also doubles for Hong Kong in <em>The Dark Knight</em>: when Fox is talking with Lau on the roof of Lau's Hong Kong office, you can clearly see Chicago's McCormick Place in the background.
</li><li> Elements of Gotham City from both films (and presumably the third) were also built in the massive disused airship hangars at <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Cardington#Film_and_Television">RAF Cardington, Bedfordshire, England,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in a weird case of this trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>, Chicago stopped doubling for Gotham. Instead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a> were used.
<ul><li> Notably from Pittsburgh is the usage of Heinz Field, the home stadium of the Steelers, as the home stadium of the Gotham Rogues. Other parts are represented by Los Angeles.
</li><li> In the same film, the Highlands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Scotland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Scotland">Scotland</a> doubled for <em>Uzbekistan</em>, of all places (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a> during Bane's plane heist). This was incredibly obvious to anyone who lived nearby or who visits regularly. Not that anyone is complaining.
</li><li> Even more, whatever wasn't filmed in Pittsburgh or Los Angeles was filmed in New York City due to Mayor Michael Bloomberg being a fan of the series (not to mention a subtle tribute to the fact that Gotham, is, in fact, one of the DC Universe's homages to New York along with Metropolis; the Nolanverse even has such things as the police cars using a livery inspired by the one used by the NYPD in the 1990s). Notably, Bane's attack on the Gotham Stock Exchange had exterior filming on the same street as the New York Stock Exchange; and the final battle that takes up most of the film's final act has locations such as Saks Fifth Avenue clearly visible during car chases <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> revolving around a jury-rigged nuclear bomb</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWindAndTheLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWindAndTheLion">The Wind and the Lion</a></em> was filmed in Spain, with Spanish locations being used to portray the Moroccan desert, Tangier, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">Washington, D.C.</a>, Oyster Bay, Long island, and Yellowstone National Park. Railroad buffs will notice some obviously European railroad cars in the background when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> is giving a whistle-stop speech; otherwise, it's a pretty convincing job.
</li><li> All <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WrongTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WrongTurn">Wrong Turn</a></em> films are set in West Virginia, but first two movies were shot in Canada and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WrongTurn3LeftForDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WrongTurn3LeftForDead">third</a> one was shot in Bulgaria.
</li><li> Vienna and the countryside around it doubles for Paris and the French countryside in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeMusketeers1993" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeMusketeers1993">The Three Musketeers (1993)</a></em>. It is somewhat jarring for a native to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleurDeLis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleurDeLis">Fleur de Lis</a> in imperial Austrian buildings, or neo-gothic profane buildings being used as gothic cathedral stand-ins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SexAndTheCity2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SexAndTheCity2">Sex and the City 2</a></em> was filmed in Morocco, doubling for Abu Dhabi. The filmmakers had asked permission to film in Abu Dhabi (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Dubai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Dubai">Dubai</a> before that), but were denied both times.
</li><li> Quite bizarrely, <em>Youth In Revolt</em> is set in various California locations (Oakland, Ukiah, Berkeley, Santa Cruz) but filmed entirely in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan">Michigan</a>! Of course, it doesn't look remotely like California. With California so easy to film in already, one wonders why Michigan was chosen...tax credit, perhaps?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airport">Airport</a></em>, Lincoln International Airport is supposed to be located in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwinCities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwinCities">Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport</a> was redressed to be used (due to the producers not wanting to risk a lack of snow in Chicago). The first sequel <em>Airport 1975</em> uses entirely real airports, making use of both Washington Dulles International Airport and Salt Lake City International Airport.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film <em>Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna</em> is supposed to be set in New York City. However, the trains are prominently labeled as SEPTA trains; the regional rail system of Philadelphia.
</li><li> The Indian film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanaa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanaa">Fanaa</a></em> is a really peculiar example of this, as it uses the <em>Polish Tatras</em> to stand in for the Indian bits of the Himalayas (!). As weird as it sounds, according to the producers, this was a cost and logistics saving measure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prophecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prophecy">Prophecy</a></em> is based on Maine, when it was actually shot in New Columbia of Canada. It also popularized the Canada Doubling.
</li><li> St. Louis doubled for several cities in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UpInTheAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UpInTheAir">Up in the Air</a></em> (including Milwaukee, where most of the third act takes place). Oddly enough, Missouri does not have a tax-incentive program (an exception was made for the production though).
</li><li> St. Louis (mostly East St. Louis, but some on the other side of the river) also doubled for New York on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromNewYork">Escape from New York</a></em> as parts of the area had suffered enough damage to make for a convincing post-apocalyptic setting. A number of the shooting locations have since been restored or rebuilt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMechanic1972" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMechanic1972">The Mechanic (1972)</a></em>: Some scenes were actually filmed on location in New Orleans. However, New Orleans also happened to double for Chicago, Houston and Colombia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleLosAngeles">Battle: Los Angeles</a></em> was set in... well, look at the title, but was filmed in Shreveport and Baton Rouge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RacingStripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RacingStripes">Racing Stripes</a></em> has South Africa playing Kentucky. (In the 1980s quite a few movies shot in South Africa omitted to mention this on the credits, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheApartheidEra">for obvious reasons</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Adrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Adrift">Adrift</a></em>, the in-name-only sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OpenWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OpenWater">Open Water</a></em>, is a real hodge-podge - a German production filmed in English with an almost completely American cast, set off the coast of Mexico... and filmed in <em>Malta.</em>

This includes the characters walking to and from Hogsmeade as well as the Hogwarts Express traveling across the snowy countryside. This is the only time the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movies have filmed outside of the U.K. and Ireland.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMaxFuryRoad">Mad Max: Fury Road</a></em> is set in the Australian Outback but was filmed in the southwestern African country of Namibia. Filming was supposed to take place in Australia but the winter before production was extremely rainy and made the landscape too lush for the dystopian setting so production was moved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Midsommar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Midsommar">Midsommar</a></em> is set in Sweden but was filmed outside of Budapest, Hungary.
</li><li> Whereas <em>Boogeyman</em> was set in the US but filmed in New Zealand, the sequels were set in the US and filmed in Bulgaria.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream4">Scream4</a></em> was filmed in Michigan, despite still taking place in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California. The first three films were all filmed in Los Angeles.

</li><li> The two German-produced <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeInvestigators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeInvestigators">The Three Investigators</a></em> movies, <em>The Three Investigators and the Secret of Skeleton Island</em> and <em>The Three Investigators and the Secret of Terror Castle</em>, had California be played by South Africa. This trope was partially averted in the first movie, however, most of which is indeed set in or off the coast of South Africa.
</li><li> <em>Away We Go</em> depicts a sort of road trip across the United States, but was almost wholly filmed in Connecticut — which doubled for Colorado; Madison, Wisconsin; and Montreal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AKnightsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AKnightsTale">A Knight's Tale</a></em> had the Czech Republic double for France and London.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissingInAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissingInAction">Missing in Action</a></em> movies, Vietnam is played by the Philippines in the first (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst">which was actually the second</a>) and third movies, while Mexico and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts took the "role" in the second (which was the first).
</li><li> The 1974 version of <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> had scenes filmed in Istanbul, but the train scenes were filmed in France. The 2017 remake replaced Istanbul with Malta but filmed everything else on backlot.
</li><li> The countryside of the Czech Republic doubles for Southern England in <em>Dark Blue World</em>, which would have been all right if it weren't for the conspicuous forested hills and snowy mountains in the background.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JumpingTheBroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JumpingTheBroom">Jumping the Broom</a></em> has Nova Scotia, Canada doubling as Martha's Vineyard.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAltman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAltman">Robert Altman</a>'s film of the play <em>Beyond Therapy</em>, though set in New York, was shot in Paris because he was living there at the time.

Also, the Sentinels' only road game in the film was shot at FedEx Field, home of the Washington Redskins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Haywire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Haywire">Haywire</a></em>, which otherwise averts this trope (the movie's Ireland and Spain settings were indeed filmed there), has New Mexico playing New York State.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorLeague">Major League</a></em>, the popular 1989 comedy about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cleveland">Cleveland</a> Indians baseball team, was not actually filmed in Cleveland but rather in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Milwaukee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>. Milwaukee's County Stadium acted as a stand-in for the Indians' then-home, Cleveland Municipal Stadium. However, since the two ballparks were relatively close in age and architectural style, it was a plausible alternate. Such was not the case, however, for the movie's sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorLeagueII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorLeagueII">Major League II</a></em>, which also was not filmed in Cleveland but instead in Baltimore. That movie was shot in the fall of 1993, which just so happened to be in between the seasons that—in real life—the Indians moved from their old home at Cleveland Stadium to their new home, Jacobs Field (now known as Progressive Field). Producers used the Baltimore Orioles' home ballpark, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, as the Indians' home stadium. Oriole Park was built just two years before Jacobs Field and featured the same architects and neo-classical style as Jacobs Field, so one would think that producers would have used the stadium as a stand-in for Jacobs Field. However, producers instead inexplicably dressed up Oriole Park as the Indians' old stadium, Cleveland Stadium, despite the fact that the former was 56 years newer than the latter and bore no physical resemblance to it. Producers were so sloppy with the stand-in that one can notice numerous advertisements for local Baltimore businesses left conspicuous despite the film supposedly taking place in Cleveland.

Having been filmed almost entirely in Europe with (to name a few) Glasgow doubling for Philadelphia (The square with the red pavement is George Square), La Valletta doubling for Jerusalem and various towns and cities in England doubling as Canada, South Korea and Wales (despite Wales also being a filming location for other scenes).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereTheHeartIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereTheHeartIs">Where the Heart Is</a></em> mostly takes place in Oklahoma, with one scene in Maine, but was filmed entirely in Texas. Baylor University stood in for Maine's Bowdoin College.
</li><li> A bizarre inversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouthInRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouthInRevolt">Youth in Revolt</a></em>. The film is set in various California locations-Oakland, Clearlake, Berkeley, Ukiah, etc. Yet it was filmed entirely in <em>Michigan</em>, with some reshoots in Louisiana. Obviously, Michigan looks nothing like California, though it could be said that the exact setting of the story is unimportant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2015">Fantastic Four (2015)</a></em> was shot mostly on a sound stage in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with exterior shots of the city used to stand-in for New York.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar">Interstellar</a></em>, the unspecified countryside of the US Midwest was shot mostly in southern Alberta and other neighbouring Canadian prairie provinces. Iceland's glaciers, highlands and coastal shallows were used for filming the different environments of the three extrasolar planets visited during the course of the storyline.
</li><li> Pittsburgh portrayed Indianapolis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFaultInOurStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFaultInOurStars">The Fault in Our Stars</a></em>, due to Pennsylvania offering more generous film-production tax credits than Indiana.

</li><li> The film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Oklahoma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Oklahoma">Oklahoma!</a></em> had exterior scenes shot in Arizona.

It contains a pretty unique assembly of almost all architectural styles up to the war era and was left untouched by the war itself. Both German and big budget Hollywood productions (e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Valkyrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></em>) have shot there with Görlitz standing in for Berlin quite a lot.

One scene has McClane in the airport talking on the phone to his wife who is in an approaching plane, and "Pacific Bell" can clearly be read on the payphone he's using.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Silence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Silence">Silence</a></em> is set in Japan but filmed in Taiwan because Japan's landscape has changed <em>drastically</em> from the the 17th century to the 21st.
</li><li> Metropolis and Gotham City are basically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">good</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigRottenApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigRottenApple">bad</a> sides of New York split into two cities. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em> was mostly filmed in Michigan.

The action at Holtzwihr, for which Murphy received the Medal of Honor, took place in the bitterly cold winter of 1944-1945 (Murphy said of fighting from the back of a burning armored vehicle "it was the only time that winter that my feet were warm") but in the film, it's a warm summer day without a single snowflake in sight.

It more or less works, especially as there is supposed to be a dreamlike quality to the landscape, but they failed to secure any right-hand drive vehicles.
</li><li> The jungle scenes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jungle">Jungle</a></em> were shot in Colombia, rather than Bolivia where the events actually happened. Most viewers would be hard-pressed to tell the difference.

There are parts of Evansville that do match with parts of the greater Lansing area, but it can still be difficult to make one a convincing double of the other.

Given Jack Sawyer's experiences in Hollywood, as well as his mother's reputation as Lily "Queen of the B's" Cavanaugh, Jack spots similarities between New England and the ominous Point Venuti in Northern California, remembering that if any scenes on the beach needed to be filmed in the Northeast climate called for in the former, places like the latter would be employed.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Sometimes Getting the Accent Right can distract the viewer from the wrong setting. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CagneyAndLacey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CagneyAndLacey">Cagney &amp; Lacey</a></em> was set in NYC, but filmed in California, yet still felt right, because everyone in the cast sounded like they lived in NYC. Contrast with <em>CSI: NY</em> where almost no one sounds like an East coaster at all, let alone a New Yorker. Of course, because the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> shows were filmed there, even the extras with one line sounded like New Yorkers. It's also one of the few shows where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> regulars pop up in cameos, because <em>Sesame Street</em> is also filmed in New York.
<ul><li> Not to mention that Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless, in real life, don't sound anything like they do on the show.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to the major German television broadcasters producing most of their stuff in Cologne, there is certainly much Cologne Doubling to be found in German TV. One show got caught red handed: While the dialogue established the scene to be in a different city, the cars had Cologne license plates.
</li><li> Gemenc forest (Hungary) doubles frequently for other forests (such as in the <em>Robin Hood</em> series or in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KrodMandoonAndTheFlamingSwordOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KrodMandoonAndTheFlamingSwordOfFire">Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire</a></em>).
</li><li> The Volusia County Courthouse and environs, during the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAdventureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAdventureShow">90s</a>, was frequently used as a courthouse or other corporate/municipal building in futuristic shows.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmericans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmericans">The Americans</a></em>, largely set in the Washington, D.C., area, is shot in New York City, which also doubles for Philadelphia and the Soviet Union in various episodes.
</li><li> The Canadian miniseries <em>Bad Blood</em>, about the Rizzuto crime family, is set in Montreal, a city known for standing in for other cities in film projects. So naturally it's filmed in Sudbury, a mining city in northern Ontario with about a tenth of Montreal's population.
</li><li> <em>Beaver Falls</em> is about three British teenagers who get to work at the title summer camp in California. There are at least three real places in the US called Beaver Falls, exactly none of which are in California - and in the case of the camp, California was played by South Africa (and few if any of the "Americans", this being a British-Canadian-South African co-production, were played by actual Americans).
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blindspot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blindspot">Blindspot</a></em> the New-York-based FBI agents make a quick visit to the CDC headquarters. where they learn of a potential outbreak in "nearby" New York Harbor. The CDC headquarters is actually in Atlanta. (For once, this isn't fake scenery but a faked-out detail in the script).
</li><li> Hungary is also the location for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cadfael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cadfael">Cadfael</a></em>, presumably since most of England doesn't have that undeveloped medieval look any more.
</li><li> The 1989 TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorDoctor">Doctor Doctor</a></em> was supposedly set in Providence, Rhode Island, but was filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Denver">Denver</a>, Colorado. This explains why you could occasionally see the Rocky Mountains in the background; the highest point in the actual state of Rhode Island is only 812 feet above sea level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Croatian city of Trogir has stood in for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfCanals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfCanals">City of Canals</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E6TheVampiresOfVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E6TheVampiresOfVenice">"The Vampires of Venice"</a> and for Arles and the surrounding French countryside in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E10VincentAndTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E10VincentAndTheDoctor">"Vincent and the Doctor"</a>.
</li><li> In Series 8, CGI-augmented shots of volcanic mountain plains on the island of Lanzarote double for the surface of the Moon. Since Lanzarote was used for filming the planet of Sarn for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E5PlanetOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS21E5PlanetOfFire">an 1980s serial</a>, many pre-broadcast rumours posited that what turned out to be the Moon-based episode would be a revisiting of Sarn. (Naturally, the showrunner and crew were eager to exploit and troll the curiousity of fans over this...) In Series 9, filming on the Canary Islands was revisited in order to shoot exterior scenes standing in for Nevada in the US, as well as for composite landscape shots of both Skaro (seen in the opening two-parter) and a post-Time War Gallifrey (seen in the finale episode). Some scenes were also filmed at a local town square, to represent an unspecified southern European location for the brief Earth-bound intro of the opening two-parter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica">South Africa</a> has played the planet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E2TheGhostMonument" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E2TheGhostMonument">Desolation</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E3Rosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E3Rosa">Alabama</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS38E1E2Spyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS38E1E2Spyfall">the Ivory Coast, the Australian Outback and the San Francisco Bay Area</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ed">Ed</a></em> was set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio">Ohio</a>. All outdoor scenes were filmed in Westfield, New Jersey.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmeraldCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmeraldCity">Emerald City</a></em> much of the architecture of the eponymous city is lifted directly from Barcelona. Anyone casually familiar with the city will notice Gaudi's work, most notably scenes taking place inside Park Güell.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEvent">The Event</a></em>, Sean and Leila's "Caribbean" cruise actually took place off the coast of Hawaii.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fargo">Fargo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Seasons 1 through 3 are set in Minnesota, as the opening title cards make abundantly clear. These seasons were filmed in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Calgary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Calgary">Calgary</a> and surrounding Alberta towns, despite Minnesota having its own film industry.
</li><li> Season 4 is set in 1950 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KansasCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KansasCity">Kansas City</a>, Missouri, but was filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em>. The show is set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a>, but anytime they do on location filming it's apparent they filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a>, where the show was filmed. This is averted in the season eight premiere where they actually filmed on location in San Francisco.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Girls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Girls">Girls</a></em> episode "The Return" has Hannah go back to her family in what purports to be East Lansing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan">Michigan</a>. This bit was actually shot in Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York, a suburban area just a bit north of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a>; it certainly looks like nothing like East Lansing (for one thing, it's too hilly).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife">The Good Wife</a></em> is set in Chicago and filmed in New York. It's hid pretty well by the fact that much of the filming is in done the outer boroughs. The writers clearly didn't do much research regarding Chicago geography, but that's a whole other trope.
<ul><li> They did find out the executions of Death Row prisoners are often carried out in Indiana, though, because Terre Haute has a Federal execution chamber, and so Death Penalty appeals lawyers pleading cases in Illinois are often from Indiana.
</li></ul></li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> normally averts this trope, there are a few exceptions: New York State played Connecticut in "New Haven Can Wait" and "The Townie", and Europe in "The Return Of The Ring" (for the ending in Monte Carlo) and "Gone Maybe Gone" (for the pre-credit scenes in Monte Carlo and Italy).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Graceland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Graceland">Graceland</a></em> takes place in California, but is actually filmed in Florida, creating a strange inversion of this trope. You can see this in many shots, when there are no mountains where there should be some.
</li><li> <em>The Highwayman</em> (a Glen A. Larson series) was set around America but filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Arizona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Arizona">Arizona</a>; Lee Goldberg (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder">Diagnosis: Murder</a></em>) wrote of the episode "Send in the Clones", "Phoenix badly, and obviously, stood in for New York locations (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedVegetation">palm trees in Central Park!</a>) in this sloppily shot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot">pilot</a>."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS">House of Cards (US)</a></em> is set in Washington DC, with parts in exotic locales like China, St. Louis, New York, Kansas City and California. But due to high costs of filming in Washington, nearly all location shots (and some interiors like restaurants and hearing rooms) were done in the Baltimore area, which is cheaper to shoot in and much closer to the show's sets in Joppa, northeast of Baltimore City. Averted in the second season when one plotline does take place in Joppa.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InTheHeatOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InTheHeatOfTheNight">In the Heat of the Night</a></em> was set in Sparta, Mississippi, but was filmed in Louisiana for the first season, and then in Covington, Georgia for seasons 2-6.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie">iZombie</a></em>: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> <em>Zombie High</em> takes place in Oregon, but is shot in Seattle for tax break purposes (lampshading how <em>iZombie</em> itself takes part in Vancouver Doubling).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JohnAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JohnAdams">John Adams</a></em> takes place in various parts of colonial United States, including Philadelphia and Boston. However, the entire mini-series (save the European scenes) was shot in the state of Virginia. This troper was even an extra, and in one day filmed scenes that took place in BOTH Philadelphia and Boston, while the filming itself was done in Williamsburg, VA. However, the scenes taking place in Europe <em>were</em> shot on-location.
<ul><li> Was also an extra in the TV movie "Killing Kennedy", which was also shot in the Richmond VA area, despite the scenes taking place mostly in Dallas, TX circa 1963. Richmond also doubled for New Orleans, Washington DC, Russia, and Mexico City while stock footage was used for key aerial shots.
</li><li> Also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Turn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Turn">Turn</a></em> is filmed in Central Virginia, despite taking place in the Revolutionary-era Northeast (centering on the Long Island town of Setauket, but frequently venturing to New York City, rural Connecticut and New Jersey, and even to Philadelphia for a few episodes). Virginia is basically known for being the filming site of a whole bunch of historical period pieces, regardless of where they actually occurred, mostly because Virginia has good tax breaks and because Virginia has an embarrassment of colonial sites to film at, while the Northeastern sites are frequently covered over by development (try to shoot scenes of Washington's New Jersey camps close to their locations in Morris County and it'll be hard not to accidentally get a McMansion, a modern paved road, or an office park in the background).
</li></ul></li><li> The pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified">Justified</a></em> was shot in Western Pennsylvania, doubling for Kentucky. Subsequent episodes have the more common Southern California doubling, though this was averted for one episode that actually took place in Southern California.
</li><li> <em>Less Than Kind</em> is an aversion (since it was both filmed and set in Winnipeg) but there's an odd in-city example - in the episode where Sheldon, Miriam, and Danny are taking an art course at "the university", the outdoor shot shows the Winnipeg Mint.
</li><li> Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> is set in Boston and filmed in Portland, Oregon. (Season 1 averts the trope for the most part, being set and filmed in Los Angeles.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> features Hawaii Doubling, with the help of CGI backgrounds (primarily from Sydney, Korea, and London).
<ul><li> Alan Dale's scenes in the season 4 finale were actually filmed in London. He was appearing in <em>Spamalot</em> at the time, so he couldn't make it to Hawaii. This was the first time the show filmed outside the US.
</li><li> And a real relief they actually had to film Alan Dale's scenes in London, as a previous episode with Desmond in 'London' had to have had some of the shoddiest backgrounds and doubling ever. Even more bemusing considering the 'Sydney' and 'Korea'' scenes have always looked fine.
</li></ul></li><li> The TV miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLostRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLostRoom">The Lost Room</a></em> has a scene set in Las Vegas. In one take, an Albuquerque bus drives past; in another, the Sandia Mountains - what Albuquerque has to the west instead of a skyline - are clearly visible.
</li><li> The pilot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLyingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLyingGame">The Lying Game</a></em> was filmed on location in New Mexico; production for the series shifted to Texas. The series is set mainly in Phoenix and Las Vegas (with stops in Los Angeles).
</li><li> Outside of a few exterior shots, the bulk of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MemphisBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MemphisBeat">Memphis Beat</a></em> was shot in New Orleans.
</li><li> The short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX">FOX</a> series <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_(TV_series)">Mental<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> was set in L.A. but shot in Colombia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMusketeers">The Musketeers</a></em>, being a version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers">The Three Musketeers</a></em>, takes place in France but was filmed in the Czech Republic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville">Nashville</a></em> also averts this trope except when it leaves the title city - in "I'm Sorry For You, My Friend" Nashville plays San Diego (thus taking California Doubling to its logical conclusion), Atlanta, Austin and itself. the most extreme case came in the final season where Tennessee stood in for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bolivia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. (Even here there's an exception, as noted in the Aversions folder.)
</li><li> Scenic Lithuania doubles for Merrie Olde England in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewAdventuresOfRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewAdventuresOfRobinHood">The New Adventures of Robin Hood</a></em>.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em> is set and shot in New York, both the city and upstate locations double for areas as diverse as Texas, Iraq, Rome, Sankt-Petersburg, and Ordos Kangbashi. They did however shoot parts of a fifth season episode in Washington D.C., where the story was set.
</li><li> The pilot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Quantico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Quantico">Quantico</a></em>, set in Virginia (flashbacks) and New York City (present), was shot in Atlanta; the series was shot in Québec. For season two production transferred to NYC.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRedGreenShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRedGreenShow">The Red Green Show</a></em>, set in the Muskoka area of Ontario, was shot in the Greater Toronto Area (the rural areas near Hamilton certainly don't look like northern Ontario).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SharpeS1E1SharpesRifles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SharpeS1E1SharpesRifles">Sharpe's Rifles</a></em> had Ukraine doubling as Spain. In fact pretty much all the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sharpe">Sharpe</a></em> series were filmed in either Ukraine or Turkey. Presumably labour is cheaper there.
<ul><li> That's actually pretty much true. In a mostly unknown 'making of' documentary for the series, they talk about the awesome Ukrainian stunt men who are cheap, plentiful and absolutely insane. Given that the core cast is actually pretty small (6 riflemen, 2 wives, Wellington, Hogan plus a handful of speaking villains du jour) and that any part of the European countryside (where all the battles are fought) looks so similar it makes no odds, it makes a LOT more sense to move the production to the stuntmen, rather than transporting and accommodating 200+ psychopathic men and horses to wherever they were needed.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1990s version of <em>Sheena</em>, set in Africa, was filmed in Florida.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpinCity">Spin City</a></em> was both set <em>and</em> filmed in New York until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelJFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelJFox">Michael J. Fox</a> left and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieSheen">Charlie Sheen</a> arrived, sending the production to Hollywood.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrikeBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrikeBack">Strike Back</a></em> has South Africa standing in for a wide variety of (sub)tropical locations, and Hungary for temperate ones. The trope is inverted in the opening episode of <em>Shadow Warfare</em> when Scott and Winchester are shown driving motorcycles along a road in "Northern California," but lane markings, roadside reflectors, etc. are ones not found in the US.
</li><li> "St. Louis, Missouri" in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> episode "Skin" looks very Canadian, with pine trees along the highway that is supposedly outside St. Louis (which does have some pine trees, but the deciduous trees dominate them, since their numbers are far more vast). Also, with "Home", Kansas isn't nearly that leafy, and Cape Girardeau is not the racist small town that "Route 666" would have you believe—it's actually a college town, since Southeast Missouri State University (SEMO) is in Cape Girardeau.
</li><li> The miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TexasRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TexasRising">Texas Rising</a></em> was shot, ironically, in Mexico. Which led to several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois">The Mountains of Illinois</a> moments, among other inaccuracies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThunderInParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThunderInParadise">Thunder in Paradise</a></em> had episodes set in many exotic locations, but the entire series was filmed in Florida. Some scenes were convincing, making good use of EPCOT Center's World Showcase. Trying to pass off Cinderella Castle as London, on the other hand...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TropicalHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TropicalHeat">Tropical Heat</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">Sweating Bullets</a></em> was a primarily Canadian production; the three seasons were shot in Mexico (for tax reasons), Israel, and South Africa. It was set in the fictional Florida Keys town of Key Mariah.
</li><li> The hidden camera show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatWouldYouDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatWouldYouDo">What Would You Do?</a></em> frequently uses a location called the Colonial Diner, located in the state of New Jersey, during social experiments that involve restaurants.

The remake of the second game fixes the issue by making Raccoon City an actual city instead of a large town and the streets accommodate several lanes of traffic.

It also doesn't help that the Japanese version of the games are written to take place directly in Japan, which makes many of the settings and characters fit better. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the first game was made with localization in mind while the sequels didn't have any immediate plans to be localized, which is why they have a lot of Japanese cultural references and why the localized versions fall into the trope. One of the localizers explained that the reason the the localized games have so much Japanese references and cultures is due the settings taking place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">an alternate timeline where anti-Japanese laws in the United States never existed</a>, allowing Japanese citizens to live and flourish in California.

Strangely enough, several other scenes shot in Tallinn were set there in the script, so this doubles as both an aversion and being played straight.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnOfficerAndAGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnOfficerAndAGentleman">An Officer and a Gentleman</a></em> plays a bit with the trope. The Navy Aviation School is situated in Pensacola, Florida, but the film was made at an abandoned Air Force base in Washington State. There are, however, no attempts made to make Washington look like Florida, and a lot of things, including local slang, are slightly altered to make us believe and feel you can become a Navy Pilot on an island west of Seattle.

</li><li> The Norwegian city of <em>Røros</em> (on the World Heritage list) is so well preserved from the seventeenth century and onwards that several productions are shot there. Most blatantly the 1969 movie <em>Ann-Magritt</em> which is based on a book with all the action from the place. Hence - the crew went there and shot the entire film.

The baby being carried away in a river was filmed at Burney Creek.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock">The Rock</a></em> actually was filmed in San Francisco and Alcatraz Prison on Alcatraz Island itself.

<ul><li> Probably one of the most notable aversions for live televisions was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger">Walker, Texas Ranger</a></em>, which was actually shot in Texas, particularly in Dallas where the majority of the show is set. However, when the rangers went to other locations, like Houston, they shot there as well. The show paid special attention to make sure you knew they were actually using Texas by having many shots of the Dallas skyline. Many scenes even used locals as extra's or one-liners.
</li><li> Sort of averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> franchise, all of which are set in and filmed in New York City (and recently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderLA">Los Angeles</a>). Many of the outdoor scenes are actually shot at or near the supposed location shown in the card. Exceptions (supposed criminal hangouts like whorehouses and drug dens) are given fake addresses. At one point the actors for the main <em>Law &amp; Order</em> actually took a pay cut in order to keep the show filming in New York City.
<ul><li> In some cases, things were filmed in New Jersey like some scenes at a train station that were actually filmed in Hoboken. After 9-11 some exteriors were filmed in Downtown Brooklyn filling in for the court and government buildings in Lower Manhattan which were inaccessible.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> was actually filmed in Baltimore, but used different sections of East Baltimore exclusively (obvious non-inclusions would be when they needed to film the ports or other locales not found in the inner city).
<ul><li> Most of the high-rise housing projects in which the Barksdale crew operates in the early seasons were actually torn down before the start of the series (this is eventually shown in Season 3). During the first season digital fakery is used to put some high rises up in the background of scenes set in The Pit.
</li><li> Their next project <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Treme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Treme">Treme</a></em> is set and filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans">New Orleans</a>.

<ul><li> However, see under the California heading - a lot of the interiors and some exteriors are filmed in California.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace">Without a Trace</a></em> set and filmed parts of one episode in Tokyo. Anthony LaPaglia was heading to Japan to watch an Australian soccer team he co-owns participate in a tournament, so he suggested filming an episode there at the same time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> is set in Miami and filmed in Miami. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">They do everything they can to remind us of that</a>. They often use the Miami area to double for various other locales, including West Africa in the pilot using careful camera shots and an orange "heat" filter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains">Royal Pains</a></em> is set in The Hamptons and shot mostly in The Hamptons (the producers try to keep all the location filming on Long Island, at least).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheStreetsOfSanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheStreetsOfSanFrancisco">The Streets of San Francisco</a></em> was set and filmed in that city, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">the opening AND closing credits did everything they could to remind us of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">that</a></em> (the end credits for each episode are displayed in front of a helicopter shot going away from the Golden Gate Bridge). That said, occasionally an episode has the odd scene set elsewhere ("Flags Of Terror" has its first scene in Japan, and "Till Death Do Us Part" begins in New Jersey and the Midwest before arriving in San Francisco).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdWatch">Third Watch</a></em> is set and filmed in New York.
<ul><li> The fictional 55th precinct on the show was supposedly "uptown" Manhattan, but they filmed extensively in the outer boroughs with the exteriors for the firehouse and precinct house being in Long Island City, Queens.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight">Forever Knight</a></em> was both shot and set in Toronto.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em> was set and filmed mostly in New Jersey. According to the creator, when he was trying to pitch the show to networks, various executives would often lose interest when he said that he wanted it filmed in New Jersey. He was later contacted by a producer from HBO, who was interested in the show specifically because the creator wanted it set in Jersey. (When Tony went to Italy on business, the show went there for real as well.)
<ul><li> Played straight in one scene in season 6's "Soprano Home Movies", which involved one of the Soprano crew carrying out a hit in Montreal; instead of going all the way to Montreal to film a scene that lasted less than a minute, they just filmed at an apartment complex in Brooklyn.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em> which is set, for once, in a generic <em>Canadian</em> city, though it bleeds from "filmed in Toronto" to "set in Toronto" as the seasons wear on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> averts this in that it is both set and filmed in New York City. However, anytime a scene is set somewhere else, it is, of course, doubled by a New York location. For instance, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot">pilot</a>, there is a flashback of Tracy running down a California freeway on which all the cars have New Jersey plates. The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a> rather pathetically tries to pass off an obviously suburban neighborhood as a hillbilly town.
<ul><li> Internal scenes set at NBC Studios on the titular 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan are actually filmed at Silvercup Studios in Queens.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a></em> is filmed in central California, and actually takes place there. While the town of Charming is up closer to Stockton and San Francisco, however, the show has occasionally doubled in LA County neighborhoods, with Charming's "main street" looking a lot like parts of Tujunga.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> is set in Newport Beach and Balboa Island, but is filmed primarily in Culver City and Marina del Rey. The use of Culver Ciy locations that are less frequently used in other shows and their similar geography (both in Southern California, in neighbouring counties) make for some fairly effective doubling, only appearing especially jarring to some Newport Beach natives.
</li><li> Averted on the 60s spy show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ISpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ISpy">I Spy</a></em> which actually filmed the real locations an episode was set in: Hong Kong, Rome, Greece, Mexico, etc (although studio work was also done in Hollywood).
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> and <em>The Cosby Mysteries</em> were set and filmed in New York (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a> hated working in Hollywood).
</li><li> Lampshaded fictional aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Studio60OnTheSunsetStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Studio60OnTheSunsetStrip">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a></em>. In the pilot episode Danny fails a drug test and cannot make a movie in California, and Matt suggests filming in Vancouver. Danny refuses, saying that "Vancouver doesn't look like anything, it doesn't even look like Vancouver. It looks like Boston, California."
</li><li> The Fox cop series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodGuys">The Good Guys</a></em> is both set and filmed in Dallas, also using local talent in small roles.
</li><li> The UK/Canada co-production <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1105836/">Burn Up<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Filmed on-location in Calgary and London - and actually set in both cities. "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/reallife/greenguide/story.html?id=d213ebcd-6192-49a3-a6c6-1b25dc82e36b">While filming in the city is hardly unique, it's rare for a high-profile project to feature Calgary as Calgary<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>."
</li><li> Almost all of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em> is set in Toronto; however, when characters travel away from home, most of <em>those</em> scenes are shot in Toronto as well.
</li><li> Averted by both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFiveO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFiveO">original</a> <em>and</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFive0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFive0">remake</a> of <em>Hawaii Five-O</em>, which meant in the case of the latter that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Danial Dae Kim</a> didn't have to move.
<ul><li> The original averted it so much so that those episodes which weren't "Filmed entirely on location in Hawaii" (like the two-parter "Once Upon a Time") don't carry that credit.
</li><li> Double subverted in the opening scene of the remake's first episode, which is set in South Korea, but filmed in Hawaii.
</li><li> And then again in "Ua Hopu", where the scenes with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Steve and Wo Fat set in Japan</span> (with the exception of the aerial shots) were filmed in, you guessed it, Hawaii.
</li></ul></li><li> Exteriors for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em> were shot in Ireland. (However, the studio interiors - and audience - were in London).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> is the master... er, mistress of averting this trope; the series is set and filmed in New York, the episode/backdoor pilot "Valley Girls," mostly set in LA, was actually filmed in LA, and when Serena van der Woodsen and Co. went to Paris those episodes were also filmed in the City of Lights. Serena spends the end of season four and beginning of season five in La-La Land, and her storyline's filmed there as well. (That said, there are a few exceptions - see above.)
</li><li> <em>The Beast</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChicagoCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChicagoCode">The Chicago Code</a></em> were both set and filmed in Chicago. The former used some of the lesser-known Chicago landmarks to interesting effect, and both took full advantage of the 'L' train tracks that run through downtown.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifetimeOriginalMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifetimeOriginalMovie">Lifetime Original Movie</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmandaKnoxMurderOnTrialInItaly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmandaKnoxMurderOnTrialInItaly">Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy</a></em> subverts this trope; the movie was filmed in Italy, but had Rome doubling as Perugia (where the murder of Meredith Kercher took place - the producers were denied permission to shoot in the actual town for obvious reasons). Italy also stands in for Germany and the US.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LemonadeMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LemonadeMouth">Lemonade Mouth</a></em> was filmed in Albuquerque, and the setting was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">changed to that</a> from the book's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNewEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNewEngland">Rhode Island</a>, complete with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool">High School</a>'s name being changed from "Opaquansett" to "Mesa".
</li><li> The Paris half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a> the Series</em> was filmed in and set in Paris.
</li><li> The scenes in the pilot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a></em> that were set in New Mexico were actually filmed in New Mexico. The rest of the series was set and filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> producers are on the record as being relieved that the spinoff series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em> could (for its first two series) be set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff">Cardiff</a>, so they don't have to pretend that recognizable landmarks are actually somewhere else.
</li><li> Doubling has been aggressively averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>, which is filmed almost entirely in the Albuquerque metro area. However, they turn around and approach the trope from the other end, because scenes set in Mexico are usually filmed in New Mexico <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorWash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorWash">with a yellow filter slapped over the camera lens</a>.
<ul><li> The show was originally set in Riverside, east of Los Angeles, and was scheduled to shoot there before the company received a generous tax break from the city of Albuquerque. The production team eventually decided to change the setting to Albuquerque because the scenery was so distinctive.
</li><li> That said, it's still played straight in both <em>Breaking Bad</em> and its prequel spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul">Better Call Saul</a></em>, where Albuquerque also doubles for Houston, Philadelphia, Hanover Germany, and suburban Chicago.
</li></ul></li><li> The sitcom <em>The Ugliest Girl In Town</em> (an American production) was both filmed and set in London (although ironically it never aired in London - the series was bought for British TV by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV">ITV</a>, but not every region showed it).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smash">Smash</a></em> is both set and filmed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> - but like <em>30 Rock</em> above, scenes set outside NYC are doubled (when Karen flies to her home state of Iowa in "Enter Mr. DiMaggio," the Hawkeye State is played by a New York suburb).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> usually plays this trope straight by filming an Ohio-set show in LA and it shows. You could play a drinking game the number of times a palm tree is in the frame, the characters are wearing too little clothing for the time of year, or when travel times from Lima to other Ohio cities are ridiculously short. The scenes in The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">Big Applesauce</a>, however, are filmed on location.
</li><li> Averted by two elements of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNBCMysteryMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNBCMysteryMovie">The NBC Mystery Movie</a></em>:
<ul><li> Not only did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/McCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/McCloud">McCloud</a></em>, set in New York, do a lot of location filming in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">the Big Apple</a> (and New Mexico, where our hero was from), but the episode "Night of the Shark," where McCloud went to Australia in pursuit of a criminal, was indeed filmed there.
</li><li> This was a condition of Richard Widmark agreeing to do <em>Madigan</em>, one of his few ventures into television (and his only series) - half the episodes were shot in Europe with the other half being in New York, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticEpisodeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticEpisodeNaming">we always knew where he was going thanks to the title of the episode</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em> episode "Dagger Of The Mind," set in London, also partly-averted it; some of the episode was filmed in Hollywood, but some of it was indeed filmed in London (providing a rare chance to see Bernard Fox actually in the UK!). In fact, one of the British actors had to remain in the US, as he was wanted for tax evasion in the UK.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DontTrustTheBInApartment23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DontTrustTheBInApartment23">Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23</a></em>, set in New York, was filmed there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldAndTheBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldAndTheBeautiful">The Bold and the Beautiful</a></em> likes to avert this when characters go overseas, with shooting in locations like Barbados and Italy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">both places where the show's very popular</a>).
</li><li> Unlike other series set in Tennessee (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MemphisBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MemphisBeat">Memphis Beat</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hellcats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hellcats">Hellcats</a></em>), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville">Nashville</a></em> is indeed filmed there; while scenes set outside the city usually play this trope straight, in "All Or Nothing With Me" scenes set in Fort Campbell - located on the Tennessee/Kentucky border - were shot on location.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em> is another show both set and filmed in New York City, though it's not a complete aversion— for reasons that even Lucy Liu herself finds confusing, Harlem is used to represent Brooklyn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneTreeHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneTreeHill">One Tree Hill</a></em> is set in a fictional town called Tree Hill, North Carolina and the show was filmed in the real North Carolina city of Willmington.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em> averted this (mostly) for the first six seasons, setting the show in California as well as filming there. Now that the show has moved to Austin, it's no longer averting the trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch">Baywatch</a></em> was mostly set on LA County beaches, where most of if was actually filmed.
</li><li> Oddly enough, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> tended to play this straight by having Los Angeles, Vancouver or Toronto double for San Francisco, there were some notable aversions in the episodes comprising the second half of season 4. Two different foot chases were filmed on location in San Francisco - the first is the one in "Mr. Monk and the Big Reward" where Monk and Natalie are chased to the police station by three bounty hunters seeking to know what Monk knows about a stolen diamond; the second one is the opening to "Mr. Monk Gets Jury Duty" where Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher chase wanted fugitive Miguel Escobar on foot through Chinatown. The MacMillan Museum in "Mr. Monk and the Big Reward" is in Pacific Heights, while a scene in "Mr. Monk and the Captain's Marriage" where Monk and Natalie tail Karen Stottlemeyer was filmed in Union Square.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> is set and filmed within Georgia and scenes set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta">Atlanta</a> were filmed in the city proper; however, there are cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelevisionGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TelevisionGeography">Television Geography</a> for locations in other parts of the state.

It has since begun meeting the trope, as it continues to be filmed in Georgia despite now being set in Virginia.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>:

This was so notable (especially for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>), that the city actually held a huge press conference to announce its partnership with Marvel. However, these shows are set in Hell's Kitchen on the west side of Midtown Manhattan. These scenes are thus filmed in neighborhoods around northern Brooklyn because real life Hell's Kitchen is gentrified and Hell's Kitchen from the comics and shows was a crime-ridden cesspool (the in-universe explanation in the Netflix shows being that the Chitauri invasion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers (2012)</a></em> caused a lot of damage in Hell's Kitchen and undid a lot of this gentrification).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em> season 3, the flashback episode to Karen Page's life in Fagan Corners, Vermont was filmed in Windham, New York.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016">Luke Cage (2016)</a></em> not only takes place in Harlem, it's also primarily filmed there (with some exceptions, such as Harlem's Paradise, which is actually in Brooklyn).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YGwyll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YGwyll">Y Gwyll</a></em> is set in in and around Aberystwyth and filmed entirely in Mid-Wales in and around Aberystwyth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JackTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JackTaylor">Jack Taylor</a></em> is set in Galway and all the outdoor locations are filmed in Galway. On the other hand, all interior shots are filmed in Ardmore Studios in Bray (just south of Dublin, on the east coast) and in Bremen in Germany.
</li><li> Dick Wolf's <em>Chicago</em> tetralogy of shows (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoFire">Chicago Fire</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoPD">Chicago P.D.</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoMed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoMed">Chicago Med</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoJustice">Chicago Justice</a></em>) are all set and filmed in Chicago. That said, there are still some liberties: e.g., the police station used for <em>P.D.</em> is actually used for the University of Illinois at Chicago Police, not the Chicago Police Department; although it was used by the CPD as the 7th District Police Station prior to 1998.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents">The Wonderful World Of Disney</a></em>'s three-part production "The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh" averts this, particularly notable as it was made in '63, and instead filmed it in England.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueBloods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueBloods">Blue Bloods</a></em> is set and filmed in New York City.
</li><li> The adventures of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungIndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungIndianaJones">Young Indiana Jones</a></em> took Indy all over the world. The show was really shot in many exotic locales in Europe, Asia and Africa.
</li><li> Averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>'s spinoffs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans">NCIS: New Orleans</a></em>, both filmed in their respective locations — except when <em>NCIS LA</em> has to go to another country. Fortunately most of those countries have so little vegetation they only need a cold blue/hot orange lighting filter.
</li><li> Every single scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sense8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sense8">Sense8</a></em> was shot in the location being depicted, and with a cast of characters scattered across the globe this meant a lot of location-hopping. The crew even went as far as filming a scene set during a flight from England to Iceland during the actual flight they took between the two locations. Unfortunately this lead to a truly enormous budget, often quoted as $9 million <em>per episode</em>, which played a large part in it being cancelled after two seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hung">Hung</a></em> was shot and set in the northern suburbs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit">Detroit</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Balamory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Balamory">Balamory</a></em>, set in a fictional Scottish island town, was shot on location in Scotland (in Tobermory, West Lothian, and Glasgow to be precise).
