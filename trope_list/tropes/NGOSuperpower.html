But there is a strong case to be made for a less conventional answer: the modern world began on a freezing New Year's Eve, in 1600, when Elizabeth I granted a company of 218 merchants a monopoly of trade to the east of the Cape of Good Hope."</em>

Even though it effectively breaks up following this, enough of its members go underground as part of the Terminal organization (consisting of the original group's titular three ships, most of the original members and a bunch of new recruits) to allow the TSA to resurface two years later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Destiny</a></em> and pull a repeat performance.

<ul><li> There is also the PMC Trust, a very powerful organization that essentially owns some smaller nations with their corporate power and military threat.

They are also powerful to influence people to turn against cybernetic implants for humanity, so that said implants can never be used against them.

While more technologically advanced than the U.S. and the USSR, their entire 'Pacific Fleet' consists of a single (very advanced) submarine and they depend on small-scale surgical strikes to get the job done.

</li><li> The Hunter's Association from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>. Understandable considering it's a gathering of the most powerful people on the planet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The Revolutionaries are strongly implied to the this. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Back</a> meeting between the world's kings reviewed that their leader, Dragon was a potentially major threat to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">World Government</a>, and accurately predicted a massive increase in his power base in six years. During that time, they've spread rebellions across the globe, slowly but surely gaining speed, as their ideals are spread. As it stands, Dragon "The Revolutionary" is titled by the World Government "The World's Worst Criminal", and the organization has become so powerful that they installed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">a mole</a> into the Government's official privateers, and are believed to have the potential to unbalance the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfPower">Balance of Power</a> the between the Marines, The Seven Warlords of the Sea, and four powerful and very influential pirate lords, the Four Emperors.
</li><li> Said pirate lords themselves can also count. Despite being put together under a single title, the Four Emperors, they are not a cohesive whole. Each Emperor operates independently of the other three and they effectively rule the second half of the Grand Line. When the Marines decided to pick a fight with the most powerful of them they brought out every single soldier and weapon they had and the Seven Warlords besides and <em>still</em> barely achieve victory.
<ul><li> When the World Government learned that two of the Emperors were going to have a face-to-face meeting, they were <em>terrified</em> by the prospect that this would result in an alliance which would be too powerful for the Marines to defeat. And a war between two Emperors is seen by the World Government as being almost as bad; while their enemies would be destroying each other, the collateral damage of a war between the pirate superpowers would still be devastating.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by the End of Act 2 of Wano Arc. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kaido and Big Mom officially form an alliance to initially take down that brat called Straw Hat Luffy, who is a major thorn in both of their plans, but they are also former crewmates as well. Soon, they decide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, starting with Wano, by Kaido pulling a quick coup on the resident decadent Shogun, and declaring to their followers and rest of the world they aim to take One Piece and crush everyone else who opposes them. It gets so bad <em>the Marines</em> freak out, and decide to wash their hands off Wano, because there's no force on the planet that can take out <em>2 Emperors</em> at once. To give a scale, the last time they fought an Emperor, their island got destroyed with <em>many</em> casualties on both sides, with the Emperor himself being taken down only due to his raging illness and treachery from one of their own. 2 Admirals resigned, causing a major shift in power. That was the Marines' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">victory</a></em>, by the way.</span>

Darth Maul formed this organization in Season 5 as a means of building a power base and rising to the top of the criminal underworld, starting by forming an alliance with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Mandalorian</a> terrorist group, Death Watch. However, the crime syndicates he recruits (themselves already being N.G.O.

With Maul briefly imprisoned by Darth Sidious following his takeover of Mandalore, the Hutt Clans abandoned the Collective as soon as possible, and every engagement his Collective has with both the Republic and Separatists (the actual superpowers in the Clone Wars) shows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">his organization is ultimately outclassed militarily</a> (and his one victory against the Separatists nearly ends with his forces getting executed).

Capable of fielding one of the most powerful militaries at extremely short notice, automatically given officer status in the Republic's forces, granted full law enforcement rights and immune from prosecution themselves, they none the less do not feel they answer to the Government and are keen to stress their independence in their internal affairs. Fortunately they are normally savvy enough to keep their shit in order, though Palpatine's ultimate plan hinged on the Jedi order's naïveté in taking this status for granted. The Jedi feel that they <strong>do</strong> serve the Republic - but not necessarily the Republic's current <em>government.</em> This is indeed exactly what happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> - the Jedi Council are growing more and more concerned that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">Chancellor Palpatine</a> is not only amassing too much power to himself and turning the Republic into a <em>de facto</em> dictatorship, but that he may be under the influence of the mysterious Sith Lord, Darth Sidious (they fail to realize he <em>is</em> the Sith Lord in question until it's too late), and debate whether it would be justified to remove him in a coup and rule by decree until democracy can be restored. Anakin is against the idea and calls it treasonous, and even the other Council members have serious misgivings.

After S.H.I.E.L.D. disbands in <em>The Winter Soldier</em>, the Avengers are left without any sort of government ties, so in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em>, they've become a fully autonomous organization funded by Tony Stark.

Natasha coordinates their various allies to react to emergencies both on- and off-world, and no mention is made of any legal issues such as with the Accords. Possibly justified given that any government body that could have any authority over the Avengers might have been significantly reduced in number and power from Thanos' Snap, so the Avengers, with Natasha reluctantly in charge, are literally the only thing keeping the post-Snap world together. That and other issues would probably render the Accords moot.

Justified in that the traitor forces do possess their own hidden arsenals, manufacturing facilities, and raid the Imperium pretty frequently for equipment, resources, and slaves. They did also start as a huge number of troops mutinying against the God-Emperor so it would make sense to have at least some equipment lying around.

</li><li> Rogue traders have the legal framework from the Imperium to operate pretty much with impunity. Warrants of trade permit them to trade with xenos, travel outside Imperial space at will, and amass as much material wealth and temporal power as they can get, and the only limits the Adeptus Terra can enforce on them are those written into the warrant. Well-established rogue trader dynasties have private security whose quality rivals the best the Imperial Guard can offer (well connected ones get actual Guard regiments seconded to them), fleets of Warp-capable transport and combat ships, and <em>are</em> the government of many planets beyond Imperial space.
</li><li> The entire Imperium is a very fractured organization with separate branches having very limited influence on each other. Pretty half of Imperium-wide organizations are separated from the rest of the government, being relatively independent and being in held in check more by military power than legal obligations.

They're explictly forbidden from owning land or titles of nobility, but each house has a near-monopoly on some aspect of the magitech the world runs on (the dwarven House Kundarak controls banking, the gnomish House Sivis controls communication, the human House Cannith controls manufacturing, etc.). The result is a kind of McDonaldization of the world: people prefer predictable House-approved merchants and services over taking a chance on an independent that <em>might</em> be better, but could equally likely be worse.

<ul><li> The Global Defense Initiative became this trope at some point over its evolution. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn">Tiberian Dawn</a></em> it was still the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedNationsIsASuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitedNationsIsASuperpower">UNGDI</a> and was explicitly reliant on the Security Council for funding and leadership, but when the world's governments collapsed from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienKudzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienKudzu">Tiberium</a> crisis, GDI was able to stand on its own, so by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars">Tiberium Wars</a></em> it had replaced the UN as a global superpower, with control over the remaining safe "Blue Zones."
</li><li> Its rival, the Brotherhood of Nod, was once considered just another terrorist organization until Interpol uncovered how extensive its secret dealings with major US defense contractors were. Nod was also remarkably quick to capitalize upon Tiberium's arrival, so that they enjoyed a monopoly on the market for a few years after the alien substance came to Earth. As a result, in the first game's backstory the Brotherhood of Nod's net worth was estimated at over 250 billion dollars, giving them the financial backing, infrastructure and advanced technology to battle GDI for control of the world. Despite its defeats, by <em>Tiberium Wars</em>, the Brotherhood has grown into an actual state by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">offering humanitarian aid, governance and protection</a> to the inhabitants of the Tiberium-ravaged "Yellow Zones."

They have no air or naval power at all, while their ground forces are either converted civilian vehicles or obsolete Soviet surplus. But the trope is played straight in <em>Zero Hour</em> when they kick out the Americans from Europe by capturing and using their own weapons against them, from attack helicopters, spy satellites, heavy tanks to their Particle Cannon.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Private Military Contractors</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HAWX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HAWX">H.A.W.X.</a></em>, who <em>invade the USA.</em> As Yahtzee of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">Zero Punctuation</a></em> puts it, "Where were they hiding all this material?

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> universe has a plethora of organizations like this.

<ul><li> The independent planet of <a class="urllink" href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Garvug#See_Also">Garvug<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had its government overthrown when it was invaded by a military alliance of Binary Helix, Guanghui Solutions, and Sonax Industries, who attacked with their large modern army and space fleet. The kicker? <em>None of these are military organizations</em>. Guanghui and Binary Helix are biotech companies, and Sonax is a mining company. They aren't Terminus organizations either, they're based in Citadel Space (Garvug is a Terminus world). They're just rich enough to have fleets and armies on hand for just such an occasion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> has Cerberus, a human supremacist terrorist organization which, due to generous covert funding from major human organizations, owns multiple deep-space habitats (some, like Cronos Station, being around 10 km long and should easily mass over a hundred million tons), funds multibillion-dollar resurrection projects, builds bleeding-edge spacecraft, and decks its people out in spiffy uniforms. Notably, they managed to rebuild the Normandy, which Admiral Mikhailovich said costed as much as a heavy cruiser (read: multi-million ton capital ship that spits out kilotons per second in its main gun alone) or 12,000 fighter craft. The multi-billion credit initiative to revive Shepard was pocket change by comparison, and even that was enough to build and outfit an army, per Shepard himself.

Per the codex, a smaller 888-meter Citadel dreadnought's main gun can fire a 20 kg slug at 4,025 km/s every two seconds, for the equivalent of 38 kilotons of TNT. Scaling this up volumetrically to a similarly-proportioned 1,000-meter long dreadnought gets you 54 kilotons outputted every two seconds (or 27 per second) from its main gun. With 86,400 seconds in a day, that would equate to 2.33 gigatons. For reference, the entirety of the world's current nuclear stockpile comes out to less than 2 gigatons. This is only the main gun, and not accounting for the dreadnought's missile pods or its dozens of broadside guns which could potentially increase its firepower by multiple folds. A typical dreadnought is said to have 156 broadsides with 78 per side, each gun running 40% of the ship's length or ~150 meters.</span>
</li><li> They pretty much abandon all subtlety in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> and deploy a few mechanized and airborne infantry divisions to locations they are interested in. You also encounter at least a few cruisers (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattlestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattlestar">an appropriate number of fighters</a>) and a fleet of shuttles and gunships supporting these troops. At first this seems like a strange jump in resources from one game to the next but its revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they are forcibly converting people into Husks and using advanced jamming technology to wrestle control of them from the Reapers. So in essence they can kidnap people and forcibly convert them into loyal mooks. Where they got the fleets and other materiel at short notice is never explained, though.</span>
</li><li> When you get to their main bases, you see easily <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/KYHjxO7.jpg">thirty<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> heavy cruisers, and at Omega, there's <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/FflHk84.jpg">at least three dozen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> visible in one particular shot.

Cerberus got 66+ heavy cruisers and a dreadnought just by skimming off the top of shell companies.
</li></ul></li><li> The soft drink company Tupari claims to sell over 12 trillion bottles of their signature product per day. That means, assuming the drink costs a mere 1 credit, Tupari's revenue for one product alone is <em>4.38 quadrillion credits annually</em>. So it's not exactly surprising that a few dozen heavy cruisers (as noted, stated to cost around 120 billion credits each) can just be skimmed off the budget of similarly-sized companies with no one really noticing.
</li><li> Also in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, the various mercenary organizations like the Blue Suns and Eclipse have their own private armies and navies; there's even one system in the game where you can read the history of a major revolution that involved Eclipse's private navy engaging in open war with the system's fleets. The Eclipse and Suns, while stateless, have vast holdings across the Terminus systems and fingers in criminal ventures throughout both Terminus and Citadel space. In particular, the Eclipse alone hold a major presence on the Asari world of Illium (they appear to virtually own the docks in the city where most of the action takes place); the Blood Pack have political clout in the krogan homeworld; and the Blue Suns control <em>at least</em> three whole planets. All three run a lot of the crime on Omega, including slave trading, element zero smuggling, and red sand trade. In <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, you can recruit these three organizations' fleets to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">the cause</a>. They give 200 war asset points collectively, while a standard Alliance fleet (consisting of over a hundred to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">several thousand</a> modern warships each including at least one dreadnought and multiple carriers) gives 90.
</li><li> While nowhere near the raw economic power of any of the above, Shadow Broker has his own small army of well equipped and highly experienced troops who rival special forces units of the most powerful military powers and he has is base on a custom built ship that permanently hides within a storm too violent for most ships to get close to. However, his trade is the gathering and selling of information and anything ever recorded by his dozens if not hundreds of opperatives and their uncountable masses of agents and informants goes over his desk and ends in his databases, giving him the power to decide essentially any war, election, investigation, or contract competition, if the customer can pay. And it also serves his own goals. His power is such that the fact that he manages to keep the information he gives out from causing serious and/or catastrophic imbalances in power from occurring is in of itself impressive to his agents. Or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>her</em></span>.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, the Nos Astra Stock Exchange, judging from the horrified reaction of the Asari investor talking with the Volus moving his assets callously to profit on a humanitarian disaster.
<ul><li> Speaking of Nos Astra, if you investigate Illium in Mass Effect 3 you will discover that the tycoons and merchant-princes who rule it have decided to fight back against the Reapers... by using their unimaginably immense wealth to finance a mercenary fleet of incredible proportions, plus lots of nukes. They don't really succeed in doing any damage to even the minor Reaper force that arrived on their worlds (the battle was referred to as quick, and the Reaper capital ships as "near-impervious" to their weapons), but did destroy a decent number of support ships and husks, and still have enough resources left over to make a notable impact on the Crucible's construction.

</li><li> The 4th game gives us the Andromeda Initiative - a multi-billion credit colonization Initiative dispatched to a different galaxy to establish a foothold for further expansion. While they dont have fleets of warships, they do have the cash to (despite explicitly being a vanity project by a single billionaire) build four ships each massing over 17 million tons and an FTL-capable space station massing <a class="urllink" href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Codex_(Mass_Effect:_Andromeda)/The_Andromeda_Initiative#The_Nexus_2">several billion tons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, all in less than a decade. The space station is meant to act as a capital city with its own military production facilities, capable of sustainably and comfortably housing nearly three million people. Besides that, they have the 'employees' and industrial capacity to establish a self-sufficient proto-state after arriving in the Heleus Cluster, complete with their own security forces consisting of several thousand soldiers and militia equipped with military-grade small arms, fighter craft, artillery, and armored vehicles, and the capability to manufacture more.

The contributions from his followers - think Occupy Wall Street with roughly <em>two billion people</em> - must help as well.

Backed up by the Common Defence Pact (aka, Russia), they're able to expand into what the game itself describes as a "heavily-militarized criminal combine" that can field hundreds of well-armed soldiers equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and vehicles, which can easily overwhelm the legitimate armed forces of Singapore and pose a significant challenge to Winslow Accord black ops soldiers.

In a specific example, the first levels of the DLC of <em>F.E.A.R 2</em>, <em>Reborn</em> consists of a massive battle between Armacham and Replica forces. This includes dozens of elite operatives on both sides, fifth-generation fighter jets (think things on par with the F-22 Raptor), helicopter gunships and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> dropped from orbit.

One of your allies who goes digging for info on them actually refers to them as a "free-standing private army", noting that there's next to nothing about them but they know everything about the FEAR organization. Even after you personally kill two- to three-hundred of them, up to and including the guy commanding the whole operation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">they considered those losses "acceptable".</a>

<ul><li> Justifiable as the GMG received financial backing from Kusari who was waging a proxy war against Rheinland at the time. It is also mentioned Rheinland lost more ships to the Crow Nebula rather than combat. Effectively, the GMG was using the space equivalent of guerilla warfare to fight against Rheinland.
</li><li> The Outcasts and Corsairs are a subversion.

</li></ul></li><li> <em>Treasures of the Deep</em>'s Simon Black. At first, he seems like a pretty run-of-the-mill arms dealer/black marketeer. But as the game progresses, he manages to reveal that he has resources that are outside the bounds of all reason. Along the way, you discover he has built nuclear reactors in the Great Barrier Reef, shot down a space shuttle in orbit and sent a heavily armed recovery team to destroy it before the U.S Navy could recover it. What takes the cake are the final two missions. Simon's military capabilities are such that he can take on a U.S Navy Carrier Battlegroup and has a <em>Seawolf-class</em> attack sub, which in all likelihood his organization built itself.

Since there are regions without Pokémon Leagues (Orre, the Orange Islands in the anime, Alola), there's strong evidence to suggest that it may not be their equivalent to a world government, but it definitely has some sort of high influence over the Pokémon world. In some cases, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Unova</a>, the Pokémon League directly exhibits a clear level of control over the region, with Gym Leaders being some of the most powerful members of their communities, and the Elite Four and Champion seemingly serving as watchmen over the region as a whole.
</li><li> The Consortium from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ActOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ActOfWar">Act of War</a></em> is basically this. Lots of money and lots of fancy weapons to wage war against America and give players an excuse to blow stuff up.

Their armies include tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, and a number of fixed-wing aircraft able to drop airstrikes for you, and they're both more than willing to sell you all of the above. UP has massive oil revenues (they own all the oil rigs in Venezuela) used to support their troops, who are all part of an American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">PMC called Tactical Solutions</a>, while the PLAV's troops are supplied by both a massive swing of counter-revolutionary reaction to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ramon Solano's</a> takeover of the country, and many of their weapons and supplies are given to them covertly by China.

</li><li> The Grey Wardens of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> setting are this in spades. An elite military organization with thousands of members in every country across the continent, they are the only ones willing and indeed able to protect the world from the darkspawn, near-mindless creatures whose only purpose is to destroy all life. Consequently, they command a great deal of respect from the people, and are given a lot of leeway when it comes to things like the law. The Wardens do what they must.
<ul><li> As a note, however, the Wardens are typically not capable of going toe to toe with large national governments. While it would be reasonable to expect them to be capable of slowly conquering the Free Marches city state by city state, their major strength when projecting military force is that the majority of Wardens end up collecting a large amount of favours within a few years, to say nothing of various treaties signed by nations and other NGOs. Wardens are powerful, but they cannot spread their power over a large area.
</li><li> The Inquisition in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> eventually becomes this over the course of the game. The Inquisitor can have mixed feelings about their newfound power and responsibility. The <em>Trespasser</em> DLC then shows that both Ferelden and Orlais were unhappy with the Inquisition hoarding that much power without supervision and thus demanded it to be disbanded or significantly downsized.

They were for all intents and purposes the government; they brought in workers and tried to "tame" the planet. But when they gave up, they just abandoned all their people. During the game itself, there is no government whatsoever until the Atlas Corporation shows up as an invading force. The DLC shows that they are trying to create some sort of government, but it's hampered both by their own cartoonish villainy and Pandora just being <em>so terrible</em>. By later games, Atlas has largely collapsed because they stretched too far.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>: The Hyperion Corporation has taken the role. It is the biggest and wealthiest business in the galaxy, and gained even more power due to taking advantage of the events of the first game. Hyperion's CEO Handsome Jack bought the entire planet, and he is hell-bent on turning it into his perfect paradise, no matter how many people he has to kill along the way with his corporate army of robots and human soldiers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He also wants to revive an ancient alien warrior so he can use it to take over <em>everything</em></span>. Part of the reason he was able to do this is because for the most part there is no centralized government on the planet to oppose him, just a scattered collection of small settlements. The Crimson Raiders, an organization made up of the remnants of Atlas and Pandoran citizens and led by the Vault Hunters who defeated Atlas last time, are the closest thing to a legitimate government left.

Playable character Moze was a member of the Vladof Corporation's elite Ursa Corp, though Vladof itself doesn't show up besides their guns. Jakobs shows up as well, in complete control of the planet Eden-6, but it's mentioned that they stayed out of the Corporate War, and they mostly make do with mercenaries instead of a standing army. Maliwan takes the role of the evil corporation, invading multiple planets with <em>ridiculously</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier">Sociopathic Soldiers</a> and trying to "merge" with (read: conquer) Atlas. Apparently Maliwan was pretty tame for a corporation for a long time, but shortly before the events of the game one of the heirs, Katagawa Jr., decided that they weren't expanding enough, so he killed all his siblings and started his conquests.

<ul><li> The Lebanese political party and terrorist group Hezbollah holds the top spot today, after the below-mentioned Islamic State's brief run was ended. To quote the Wikipedia page: "Hezbollah has the armed strength of a medium-sized army. Hezbollah is generally considered the most powerful non-state actor in the world, and to be stronger than the Lebanese Army." They have an internal economy worth over a billion dollars, a global network that has enabled them to launch terrorist attacks everywhere from Israel to Argentina, and an estimated 60,000 fighters who are considered superbly trained and armed by Middle Eastern standards. They have de facto control over large portions of Lebanon and a frightening amount of military power that, partly due to competence compared to the competitions, exceeds that of several actual Arab states. They get considerable funding from Iran, but also make money off of the drug trade, extortion rackets, and donations from sympathetic Lebanese businesses and persons.
<ul><li> To wit, Hezbollah was able to effectively defeat <em>Israel</em> in the South Lebanon War, and again in the 2006 Lebanon War. Most recently Hezbollah has become a major player in the Syrian Civil War, where they've occupied swathes of Syrian territory and acted as shock troops for Assad's government and their Iranian allies.
</li></ul></li><li> The British East India Company once effectively ruled the entirety of the Indian sub-continent, Maharajas and princes surrendered their realms before its board of directors, it had armies and fleets in its name to "Protect the outposts of the Empire".
<ul><li> Its role in the Opium Wars (making the British Empire beat down on China so it could peddle opium there at their leisure) also lend it major supervillain cred.
</li><li> Ultimately, the East India Company is a good deconstruction of the trope. While they managed to set up shop and continue for a long time, the corporation depended on alliances with local powers and client states. When they started annexing and neutralizing these client states, they had to draw soldiers from the ranks of their armies. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a> for acquiring territory via the plainly robber baron law of the "Doctrine of Lapse" pissed off its own supporters and ultimately sparked the 1857 Mutiny. Their incompetence was made clear to the Parliament in the wake of this crisis and the British Government stepped in and sent them back to England, administering India fully until its Independence.
</li><li> The British Empire had several other similar "trading companies" who fit the bill, too. Take, for example, the British South Africa Company, which basically went to war with the neighboring Transvaal, with admittedly disastrous (for them) results. A major executive in the company was Cecil Rhodes, also noted for owning the De Beers company, whose monopoly on diamond mining made them an example in themselves (even today they're estimated to control about 35% of the diamond trade).
</li><li> Several other countries had these too, with roughly the same freedoms to exercise power. During the 17th century, the British company regularly got its ass kicked by the Dutch, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">actions of that company</a> were such that the idea of locating the International Criminal Court in The Hague would have seemed ludicrous.
</li></ul></li><li> Let's discuss "that company" which kicked the Right Honourable East India Company in the derrière on a regular basis when it was a <em>relatively</em> tiny, idea-pinching start-up some more. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company">De Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (aka "the VOC" aka "the Dutch East India Company") not only invented modern corporate branding and serial rebranding as we currently know it (see that snazzy "VOC" logo they plastered on just about everything, the variants of which are handy for trade route mapping and dating purposes) out of suitably secularised and Dutchified Jesuit principles (so, deffo not nasty Iberian Catholic ideas, man — just business ideas for efficient business people). They, uh... also industrialised slavery in ways that previous slave traders and owners had never dreamed of in their push for early, cheap mass-market appeal — which incidentally also paved the way for many, many of the bad ideas when it came to the unethical practice of colonisation and the deliberate social building of inequality around the globe as it rolled out. Also, you might have heard of the C15th-C17th Spice Wars that kind of got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSPACE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSPACE">spaced-up</a> and turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">a series of books</a> you may have heard of, yes? <em>This</em> is these guys: stomping all over the English, Portuguese, Khoekhoe, Indian, Indonesian, Malagasy, Chinese and Japanese concerns like it ain't no thang. Until they both overextended themselves and ignored their homebase's internal and international mistakes until everything imploded on them. Spectacularly. On the plus-side: they funded gorgeous architecture and art millions still enjoy today. As well as broke ground in modern accountancy practices and organising financial principles our global economy still depends on (despite *cough*early teething difficulties*cough*). Yay.
</li><li> The modern Russian East Siberia and Far East Development Corporation, was said to be the modern East India Company. Then the project was scrapped and replaced with a government ministry.
<ul><li> Another Russian corporation, Gazprom (a natural gas mining company), was way more successful. Right now, it has its own units of armed guards, owns many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown">Company Towns</a> in the Russian Arctic and even has its own railroad, independent from the state-owned RZD corp. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazprom">Played with, given that 50.23% of Gazprom's shares are owned by the Russian government.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Gazprom, RZD and their nuclear energy counterpart, Rosatom, are in essence just the old Soviet natural gas, railways and nuclear energy ministries spun off and commercialized as single unified entities, not broken up and sold for pennies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">various political adventurers</a> like most other Soviet government departments and industries were in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNewRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNewRussia">The Nineties</a>. This generally allowed them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWereBummedCommunismFell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWereBummedCommunismFell">fare much better than their peers</a>, but they largely remain government ministries in practice, just run as commercial companies.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HanseaticLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HanseaticLeague">Hanseatic League</a> is perhaps one of the earliest examples. An alliance of merchant guilds that joined together for greater profit dominated the Baltic Sea and the North Sea for a few centuries. Although they were a loose and ill-defined group, they managed to force a lot of local rulers to grant them tax and toll exemptions for their trading posts and home cities. Major achievements include forcing the King of England to allow them to build an outpost in London and declaring war on Denmark.
<ul><li> Within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, which was a confederation of several electors, dukes, and dozens of lesser princes that were united by their allegiance to the emperor, many wealthy cities were autonomous territories that did not have any lord and bowed only to the emperor himself. The cities of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hamburg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, Bremen, Lübeck, and Cologne were governed by a council of merchants, which in reality meant by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HanseaticLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HanseaticLeague">Hanseatic League</a>. For a time, Lübeck and Cologne were the largest cities of the entire empire and even today the modern federal states of Hamburg and Bremen are officially named "Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg" and "Free Hanseatic City of Bremen", even though the organization has ceased to exist over 300 years ago.
</li></ul></li><li> Several modern companies are larger than small nation states <a class="urllink" href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/25-corporations-bigger-tan-countries-2011-6#not-all-are-created-equal-26">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

The Taliban has less money than Pepsico, and yet it has fought a coalition of half a dozen major countries to a standstill. How much of that is genuinely due to their resources and fighting ability and how much is the conventional militaries that oppose them being tied down by rules of engagement and lack of political will to go all out remains widely debated even today and is beyond the scope of this article.
</li><li> The International Red Cross and Red Crescent is a peaceful example. Members displaying their symbols are protected under international law and the Geneva Conventions, and it has resources and personnel rivaling just about any nation.

</li><li> The Roman Catholic Church influences the religious - and sometimes even political - beliefs of people all over the world and its leader also runs <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_city">a tiny country<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> For centuries it was more powerful than any government in Europe. Starting at around 1050, kings and emperors needed their permission to take the throne, and excommunication would have all your neighbors attacking you along with a good chunk of your nobles rebelling. Serfs often paid as much in tithe to the church as to their lord and sometimes the lord was the church.
</li><li> A huge part of the early history of the Church was the power struggle (sometimes an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>) between the Holy Roman Emperor (later the King of France too) and the Pope. The conflict basically boiled down to: the Pope can offer me prestige, but the Emperor can offer me land, allegiance, and money. Of course, given that France and the HRE were essentially the superpowers of the time, whilst the Papal States were anarchic, shockingly-run, and economically backwards, the temporal power of the Pope was severely curtailed, especially by the time the House of Hohenstaufen were done with him.
</li><li> Complicating matters further was the fact that various monarchies would attempt to install a Pope that would be friendly to their nation, eventually leading to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Schism">the Papal Schism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a 40-year period in which there were two Popes at once, with a third coming into power near the end.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar">The Knights Templar</a> were one of the most powerful organizations in Crusades-era Europe and the Middle East. They were the best Christian military force during the Crusades and established a financial empire that stretched across the Christian world. They were, in theroy, exempt from any law in Christian land, which was everywhere they operated and answered only to the Pope himself. They invented one of the earliest forms of modern banking. They had entire fleets of ships, built numerous fortresses in the Middle East and Europe and, for a year, owned the whole of the island of Cyprus (they sold it because it was too much of a pain to run). However, after the Crusades, their influence waned and this came back to bite them in the ass. King Philip IV of France decided to take advantage of this by having their leaders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">tortured into confessing to heresy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">burnt at the stake</a>. Despite the heresy accusations, it was really so Philip could avoid having to pay a gigantic debt owed to the Templars. They were then arrested and had their assets seized. The sheer power and size of the organization has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">led a few</a> to suggest they still survive as a secret society to this day. These theories are supposedly supported by the fact that Philip apparently found the Templars' treasure vaults empty, leading to speculation that the the Templars took it elsewhere beforehand. One popular - if unlikely - theory is that the surviving Templars helped Switzerland (conveniently located just outside of France) achieve independence, and went on to found the famously secretive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissBankAccount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissBankAccount">Swiss banking system</a>.
<ul><li> The Templars, despite being the most famous of the Military Orders, were arguably still in the nursery compared to the other two of the biggest Orders (there were a <em>lot</em> of them): the Knights Hospitaller a.k.a. the Order of St. John a.k.a. St John's Ambulance (yes, they're still around, but long demilitarised), and the Knights Teutonic - particularly after they grudgingly incorporated the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. Both Orders dabbled in the same kind of international banking as the Templars, but were more heavily focused on gaining and holding land. All the Orders had lands in the Middle East and in Spain, on the frontiers of Christendom (monarchs, particularly in the Middle East, tended to have a shortage of professional troops, so subcontracted the problematic bits of border defence to the various Orders), but both the Hospitallers and Teutons sought a state of their own.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsHospitallers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsHospitallers">Hospitallers</a> eventually conquered the island of Rhodes in 1310, and after they received many of the Templars' holdings, developed an Empire divided into 8 'Langues' (tongues) spread across Western and Central Europe, and held Rhodes through multiple sieges in which they were ridiculously outnumbered, spending most of their spare time as a major naval power in the Mediterranean, harassing the Ottoman navy and Barbary Corsairs, until the Ottomans finally forced them to leave after a six month siege in 1522 - and even then, they were allowed to withdraw to Sicily. Then, Charles V gave them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malta">Malta</a>, Gozo, and Tripoli for a very nominal fee of a single Maltese falcon a year, and they resumed their pirate hunting, and hunting of Muslim shipping, which made them a tidy profit - they also tended to subcontract themselves to the French navy, and their vows rather slipped. They stayed on Malta until Napoleon turfed them off in 1798, and the residents of Malta firmly refused an offer to return to the Knights' rule after the Napoleonic Wars, instead opting to become part of the British Empire (considering how the Knights treated them, and how they were prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou">treating the young women of the island</a>, this is hardly surprising). Today, they are considered an micro-state with permanent observant status in the UN, have their own monarch and are recognized as an nation by several countries (most of them Catholic majority), but their physical possessions are only two buildings in Rome and a fort borrowed from Malta.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTeutonicKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTeutonicKnights">Knights Teutonic</a> started out as a specifically German Order, which migrated to Hungary in the 13th century to administer the 'Saxon March', full of Germans who the Hungarian King had encouraged to settle there, before being turfed out by said King a few years later. It is unclear whether they were trying to secede and the King was responding, or whether the King had only intended to use them to pacify difficult lands and then boot them out afterwards, or both, but that was the way it turned out. They went to Prussia in Northern Germany, seeking to expand Christendom, German Christendom, eastwards, no matter what the pagan Prusai and Lithuanians and, indeed, Russians, had to say about it - and if you're getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">familiar feeling</a>, then don't be surprised. The Nazis and the Soviets both used the Knights extensively in their propaganda, the former championing them as early advocates of <em>lebensraum</em>, the latter as savage fascist German aggressors, immortalised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlexanderNevsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlexanderNevsky">Alexander Nevsky</a> in <em>The Battle on the Ice</em>. In any case, when founding the <em>Ordenstaat</em> ('State of the Holy Order') they took much greater care to establish their independence, and steadily expanded eastwards, taking control of the Baltic amber trade (among many other things), absorbing other Orders such as the Brothers of the Sword (whose treatment of pagans made even the Knights, no strangers to brutality, blanch), and becoming a major power in Northern Europe. When the Crusades started dying down, they responded by turning Crusading into a package tour, allowing young noblemen to come, enjoy the atmosphere, slaughter a few possible pagans, and go home able to claim they'd gone on Crusade. And when the Reformation came round, the Grandmaster of the time decided to become a Protestant and secularised the <em>Ordenstaat</em> (or the Prussian bits of it, at least), and became Duke of Prussia. The rest of the Order continued, the Grandmaster being accorded the rank of a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, taking Protestant and Lutheran adherents, sticking around as a military force until 1805 (and unofficially until 1810, when, again, Napoleon dissolved their territories).

There was a time when entire nations were armed by the black market weapons deals that Russian criminals made with Russian military suppliers. One U.S Federal operation exposed a Miami-based Mafia boss named Animal and his attempts to purchase a <em>nuclear submarine</em> for drug-running purposes. Animal reported that the man selling it to him asked "do you want that with, or without missiles?" Animal thought he was joking, but he was evidently dead serious.
</li><li> The power of the Mafia was even <em>larger</em> during the Prohibition era. With the outlawing of alcohol came one of the most lucrative and profitable illegal trades in history, as mafia bosses like Al Capone and Lucky Luciano imported premium alcohols on the cheap and sold for immense profits or sold local-brewed liquors in addition to their already-extensive drug rings. Couple this with the fact that the United States was undergoing an economic boom following the end of World War I, and you've got a perfect storm wherein the private armies of the country's biggest mafia bosses were numerous and well-equipped enough to be able to take on the might of the <em>United States Army</em> (granted, this US army was heavily cutback following WWI).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://dstevenwhite.com/2011/08/14/the-top-175-global-economic-entities-2010/">This list<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> attempts to track and rank the 175 biggest "economic entities" in the world as measured by GDP and total revenue. According to that, in 2010, the biggest NGO was Wal-Mart. It's 24th in the list, behind all the most powerful countries in the world, but ahead of Norway, Venezuela, and many more countries you've probably heard of. More entities on that list are corporations than are countries, and not every country in the world made the list. In fact, there are colleges out there (Harvard is among them) whose annual budget is greater than the GDP of some small countries.
<ul><li> The list was updated <a class="urllink" href="http://dstevenwhite.com/2012/08/11/the-top-175-global-economic-entities-2011/">in 2011.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Not much changed.

Although they were formally assigned military command by the government, their real power came from personally raised armies of loyal troops built out of vast personal fortunes. It's not surprising that the situation that allowed this eventually degenerated into civil wars. The ultimate example is Augustus: the entire Roman Empire was a formalization of his own personal authority massively outstripping that of the state to the point that it overtook and <em>became</em> the state.
</li><li> Al Qaeda, and powerful terrorist groups in general, are essentially these. They generally receive their funding and equipment via organized crime or foreign governments, and wield significant political power in certain areas of the world (in some cases, more than the actual local government). A growing school of thought amongst some political scientists and sociologists is that, due to globalization and the imbalance of power and technology between the first and third worlds, these kind of powerful, non-state entities can be expected to become increasingly more prevalent as the 21st century goes on.

</li><li> It's commonly claimed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Apple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Apple">Apple</a> is the world's most valuable company. This is entirely false. It is the most valuable company whose shares you can actually buy. It is assumed to be worth around seven hundred billion US dollars. The world's most valuable company, period, laughs at that: Owned by the Saudi royal family, Saudi Aramco is estimated to be worth <em>ten trillion dollars</em>. It has the world's largest oil reserves. It owns the world's largest oilfields. It produces almost four trillion barrels of oil every year, and has a revenue of three hundred and eleven billion dollars. It has diversified its assets into manufacturing, services, defense, and mining. In some ways, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia">Saudi Arabia</a> is not so much a country with an oil company, but an oil company with a country.
</li><li> The Islamic State was at one time the most powerful NGO on Earth, being less non-governmental and more an unrecognized State (hence the name). Controlling territory around the world, but primarily centered on the "main" branch in eastern Syria and western Iraq, the organization was an unrecognized proto-state which at its peak had over a hundred thousand soldiers (complete with hundreds of tanks), 8 million citizens, and an area of land the size of Romania under their control. They had their own currency, police forces, internal multi-billion dollar economy (primarily sustained through its tax base and its captured oil fields, plus of course the drug trade), civil services, all the hallmarks of a primitive nation-state, and the military power to not only <em>openly</em> contest the governments of Iraq and Syria during their respective civil wars, but inflict embarrassing defeats repeatedly on both the Iraqi Security Forces and Syrian Arab Army even when the latter two were supported heavily by foreign actors. It took large foreign intervention (primarily by the United States, but dozens of other countries got involved, most notably Iran, Russia, Turkey, France, and Britain) to stamp them out and keep them from conquering even more territory and possibly causing the collapse of at least Syria's government. By the end of 2017 their status as an NGO capable of going toe-to-toe with its neighbors is largely a thing of the past, although it continues to exist as a global Islamist insurgency organization and as of late 2020, IS-affiliated groups <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">have become a major problem for the governments of Central Africa</a>, including the takeover of the major port town of Mocimboa da Praia in Mozambique.
<ul><li> Note that the Islamic State's propaganda campaigns and identity as a <em>franchise</em> also gave it global influence. The large and notorious Nigerian insurgent group Boko Haram declared themselves an ally of ISIL, and ISIL affiliates controlling territory popped up in Libya, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Yemen. Attacks by Islamic State operatives, either radicalized 'lone wolves' or trained agents straight from the Levant, also occurred all across Europe (most notably in Turkish Thrace and France), killing several hundred people, and tens of thousands of Sunni Muslims from around the world (but predominantly the Middle East/North Africa region) made the trek to Iraq/Syria to join them, including former high-ranking military officers such as Tajik Colonel Gulmurod Khalimov. It got to the point that Iraq's Prime Minister declared the "War on ISIL" to be <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reuters.com/video/2015/02/01/fight-against-islamic-state-is-world-war?videoId=363066236">equivalent to a third world war<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> due <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_activity_of_ISIL#cite_ref-ISIL_has_200,000_fighters_16-0">to<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_military_intervention_against_ISIL#/media/File:Military_Intervention_against_ISIL.svg">its<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_activity_of_ISIL#List_of_nationalities_of_foreign_fighters_in_ISIL">reach<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, though just about everyone else called him out for exaggerating there.
</li></ul></li><li> The Eliot Management Corporation, run by Paul Singer, has managed to successfully sue several nations over payment of sovereign debt. A dispute with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Argentina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Argentina">Argentina</a> led them to nearly requisition an entire warship. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-fund-elliott-capital-management-seizes-ara-libertad-ship-owned-by-argentina-2012-10">No, seriously<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCartel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCartel">Drug Cartels</a> are still around despite governmental efforts. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> has articles on them, but this quote <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1370-5-insane-things-i-learned-about-drugs-as-undercover-agent.html">[2]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> gives a succinct summary of their power.
<div class="indent"><em>The next time you see a movie about a renegade cop going off on his own to take down the cartels single-handedly, Punisher style, keep that in mind. These organizations are formidable enough that entire countries have failed to take them down. </em>
</div><ul><li> The Medellin Cartel led by Pablo Escobar may be the most infamous. During its heyday in the 80-90s, they put a bounty on every police officer in Colombia, assassinated multiple government officials including a presidential candidate, and more. A specialized task force was formed to bring Escobar down, only to have Escobar murder 30 of them in just 15 days. In the end, it was the Los Pepes (a backronym of '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">persecuted by Pablo Escobar</a>'), hinted to be receiving support from various groups including the government, who fought fire with fire, launching a campaign of terror against Pablo's supporters and slowly dismantling his cocaine empire. Los Pepes were themselves formed by an NGO, an anti-communist militia formed to fight leftist guerrillas.
</li><li> Mexican drug cartels are today what the Medellin Cartel used to be, in particular the Sinaloa cartel and the Los Zetas. They make an estimated $60 <em>billion</em> dollars a year and they can stand toe-to-toe with the Mexican military, in several cases matching them for firepower.
</li></ul></li><li> The Bank of the Welser family of Ausburg was very widespread throughout the 16th century. They financed entire countries, including the Holy Roman Empire under Charles V (who, just to be clear, was king of more territory than any European monarch who preceded him). At one time they owned <em>and governed</em> Venezuela.
</li><li> The cult <a class="urllink" href="https://fas.org/irp/congress/1995_rpt/aum/index.html">Aum Shinrikyo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> used to have a political wing running as candidates and a huge fortune ($1 billion) accrued from donations and their business units such as hospitals, electronic businesses, selling the drugs they fabricated and restaurants, which they used to fund a bioweapons program (members went to Zaire to get Ebola strains and anthrax was actually manufactured and used), chemical weapons developement, even renting a sheep station in Australia to test the sarin gas they manufactured, with rumors about how they planned to use the uranium deposits on their property to create nuclear weapons; they also attempted to manufacture more mundane weapons. Their targets were some of the most educated persons in Japan, and they managed to infiltrate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce">Kaiju Defense Force</a> and the police, creating their own private militias and intelligence service, ready to strike against the enemies of the cult and to put in power the parallel government Aum created.
</li><li> In one of those strange turns of history, Pepsi Co was once, for a brief moment, the sixth largest navy in the world: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/soviet-union-pepsi-ships">The Soviet Union and Pepsi had a longstanding agreement for the distribution of Pepsi in the USSR<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which originally gave Pepsi exclusivity on selling genuine Russian vodka outside the USSR. When production of Pepsi needed to be stepped up in 1989 due to demand, the USSR, having no other drink deals to offer, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/10/opinion/foreign-affairs-soviets-buy-american.html">gave Pepsi seventeen decomissioned submarines, three decomissioned warships and a few oil tankers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> instead. Perhaps wisely, Pepsi promptly (and as intended by the USSR) sold the warships for scrap and leased out the civilian ships to the shipping industries instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorporateWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorporateWarfare">of using this new navy to stage a hostile takeover of Coca Cola</a>.
