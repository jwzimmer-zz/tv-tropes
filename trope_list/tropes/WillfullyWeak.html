Maybe they want to try this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> thing so they learn to fight tactically rather than steamroll others with brute force.

To be clear, this is NOT <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverBlowingSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverBlowingSuperpower">faking it</a>, or merely going easy on their opponents. The character actually <em>is</em> as weak as they appear... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfTheirOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfTheirOwnStrength">but only because they choose to be</a>. They could stop suppressing their powers at any moment and suddenly be an unstoppable powerhouse. Of course, given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">possible consequences</a> of them using what they normally keep under wraps, it's not always a "choice" made lightly.
</p><p>Obviously, what is considered weak varies greatly from story to story. In some stories, they'll be almost the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a>. In others, they'll actually be quite powerful, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">far behind the other supers</a>. In still others, they'll actually not be weak or normal at all, and be one of the more competent fighters, but nowhere near what they'd be capable of without this self-imposed limitation.

She can't hit anything no matter how close it is. Then it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's descended from a line of noble assassins and is able to hit all the most lethal points on an enemy without even really aiming. Since this skill is so instinctual at this point she has to fight to avoid targeting those points, an effort that results in her not only missing those points but missing the target entirely.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>: Sebastian the demonic butler does this; although he's extremely skilled, fast and strong anyway, it's only when Ciel gives him a direct order to do something that he starts showing all of his inhuman capability. If Ciel's orders aren't worded carefully, however, Sebastian can get very creative in carrying them out or living up to the broad contents of their contract.
</li><li> Kumagawa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em> as he allowed himself to be beaten up by Medaka's Successors then proceeded to pin them down in one move. Also happens against Kugurugi Mogura. He could have finished her in one move, which he did, but wanted to give time for Emukae to confess to Zenkichi.
</li><li> Washu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a>.</em> She's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually one of the Choushin (a goddess, basically) in human form.</span>
<ul><li> And as she demonstrates in the second OAV, "weak" is a <em>very relative term</em>. Even with her powers restricted, she's <em>much</em> stronger than Ryoko, who, prior to Washu's appearance, was arguably the single most powerful cast member other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue">Tenchi himself.</a>
</li><li> Then again, Ryoko only had one out of three jewels; Tenchi didn't let her have the others, even when giving them to her would have been a good idea, making her a partial example.
</li><li> Later on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP">GXP</a> shows that Tenchi starts doing this himself since he, like his grandfather, prefers living simply without the responsibility of running the galaxy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Goku's fighting in a tournament and reveals suddenly that he's wearing extremely heavy clothes, as part of his training. And is suddenly a <em>lot</em> faster once he gets rid of the extra weight. The same thing happens again several times, all the way up to Goku's fight with Freeza, at which point everybody is so strong that weighted clothes are no longer enough of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> to bother mentioning.
<ul><li> Weighted clothes show up in one of the games, (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/NoProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/NoProblemWithLicensedGames">Buu's Fury</a>), taken to hilarious levels. By the end, you can wear one kiloton armbands and boots!
</li></ul></li><li> In the 22nd Tournament, Goku purposely held back so he wouldn't kill the people he was fighting, it <em>was</em> a tournament after all. Since he figured that Tien wouldn't die if he went all out, he cut loose, proving to be stronger than Tien although only by small amount. This was hinted at earlier when he was fighting Krillin, warning him that he was going to hit a little hard, so don't die.
</li><li> During the fight against Nappa and Vegeta in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Goku limits his use of the Kaio-ken technique because the strain of using it at high levels can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">damage his body</a>. He could have used the Kaio-ken x4<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken">Kamehameha</a> that finally defeats Vegeta right from the start, but it wasn't worth the risk until it proved absolutely necessary.
</li><li> Frieza limits his power because his body can't take it. Unfortunately, when he does go all-out against Goku, it's too late, since his stamina didn't last throughout their fight.
</li><li> When Goku fights Vegeta the second time in the Buu Saga, in order to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> avoid burning out his remaining time</span>, he decides not to use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan 3</a>, instead restricting himself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan 2</a>.</span> Vegeta finds out about Goku's self-imposed limit later on. Needless to say, he is less than happy about it.
</li><li> Gohan is depicted as having the potential to become, quite literally, the most powerful warrior in the entire <em>universe</em> if he wished (and he actually does so a couple of times), but is a pacifist by nature, only fighting when someone needs his protection. Typically, his true strength only reveals itself through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>.
</li><li> In the U7 vs U6 Tournament in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, it's revealed that Hit, U6's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Ace</a>, is holding back his best techniques. This is because Hit is an assassin by trade, so his best moves are killing techniques, but killing your opponent in a tournament is forbidden. Goku goes out of his way after the tournament to arrange to fight Hit with no restrictions, accepting the possibility that he could die in doing so.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title character could kill himself - and many others - if he ever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkMode">uses his full power</a>.
</li><li> Rock Lee wears weights on his legs to reduce his speed. He takes them off during the fight with Gaara. Unlike Naruto, Lee is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">host to an apocalyptic demon</a>, but he has learned techniques that, if abused, could kill him. His sensei forbids him from using even the most basic of these techniques (which they share) except in a dire emergency. When Lee takes off the weights for the first time, several characters scoff at the idea that it'll make a difference against Gaara. Until the weights hit the ground and produce substantial craters, implying that Lee must have been wearing a few <em>tons</em> of weights. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Which really ought to have resulted in massively powerful kicks while he was wearing them</a>. To be fair, the problem wasn't that he wasn't kicking hard enough. He simply wasn't fast enough to get around Gaara's sand barrier with the weights on.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca">Flame of Recca</a></em> as well as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">older brother Kurei</a> and any other Flame Master must wear seals on their arms to protect their already fire resistant selves from the power of their flames going out of control and burning them to death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome">Ikkaku</a> is hiding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">bankai</a>, so he tries not to use it when he fights even when his opponents require bankai to be defeated. He actually throws a fight and is defeated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">Poww</a> precisely because he refused to activate bankai. Poww could tell Ikkaku was hiding power even though Ikkaku refused to admit it. In the end, Ikkaku had to be rescued by Captain Komamura and received a stern lecture from Iba about his behaviour.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Yumichika</a> goes one step further than Ikkaku: he's hiding his entire power. He <em>fakes</em> his shikai release to hide the fact he possesses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">kidou-type</a> zanpakutou from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">kidou-hating</a> division. As a result, he fights physically, on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">willpower</a> alone, even when his opponents have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">released their full power</a> and are thrashing him due to the imbalance of power.

</li><li> Ichigo gets a moment of this fighting a Privaron. He's reluctant to release his now-controllable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> as he knows that it will leave him weaker for later fights, and also knows that he's going to hit problems if he's releasing it this early on.

Normally though, Ichigo fights at full strength.
</li><li> Hitsugaya's zanpakutou's most powerful and most basic ability can be used in either shikai or bankai. However, he traditionally avoids using it in bankai even when he needs to because his inexpert control over it and wide area of effect would drag in too many bystanders/allies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Against Harribel, he only decides to use it when his bankai is half-gone, allowing him better control than he would have had when his bankai was at full power.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Kenpachi's</a> childhood left him so afraid of boring fights that he subconsciously limits himself to ensure victory is a struggle. As a child, he was so powerful that fighting was meaningless until he almost defeated Yachiru. The fear of almost losing his first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> caused him to limit himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Yachiru</a> is eventually revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Captain Unohana</a> when she subjects him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to break him out of this willfully weak attitude she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">takes responsibility</a> for causing.</span>

The first is the fact that unlike most Arrancar, who traded their their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">high speed regeneration</a> for a raw power boost after evolving, Ulquiorra kept his and forgoed the power boost, meaning he's still "only" as strong as his original Hollow self (though considering he was a Vasto Lorde level Hollow, it didn't badly limit him). The second is that his rank is only based on the power of his <em>first</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">release</a>, and he possesses a unique second form (Segunda Etapa) that no other Arrancar in Aizen's army has and that not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Aizen himself</a> knows exists.
</li><li> Coyote Starrk is the First Espada and one of the powerful members of Aizen's army, but it doesn't really show because Starrk is both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantWarrior">Reluctant Warrior</a> whose heart is rarely into fighting. Which is a good thing, because he can stomp Captain-level foes into the ground easily when he finally gets motivated.

She never uses it, however, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using it long enough would revert Medusa into the monstrous Gorgon.</span>
<ul><li> Likewise, she always had herself blindfolded, which prevents her ability <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye">Mystic Eyes</a> to run amok (if not blindfold, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko">a pair of glasses</a>).

</li><li> She has another case of holding back and make herself look like a weak Servant: she just dislikes using full power when her master is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Shinji</a>. On the other hand, when her Master is the real one (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sakura</span>), it's a different story: Still no Monstrous Strength, but removing blindfold becomes a viable option.

<ul><li> Easy enough to not notice, but in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> Yugi's duel with Rebecca Hawkins was one of the few duels where he didn't transform into Yami Yugi. The idea was that Rebecca wasn't a villain trying some sort of underhanded tactic, but merely an opponent who accused Yugi's grandpa of stealing from her Grandpa.
</li><li> This was also part of the backstory behind the monster card Gearfried the Iron Knight, as told by Joey. He was once a mighty swordsman whose power was so great that he could level entire cities simply by swinging his sword. In order to protect those around him, he donned a suit of iron armor that would limit his power.

Played with near the end of the duel, where it reveals that he not only <em>does</em> now the deck well, but he changed the deck up and improved it. He was just pretending to be weak to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">troll</a> Asuka, and calls her an idiot for believing him.

</li><li> In the anime, the Inner Senshi tend to hold back to avoid collateral damage, and only cut loose twice: at the end of the first season, where there's nothing to damage and even after being mortally wounded make short work of Beryl's five strongest youma, and in the battle on the asteroid during the first movie, at which point they waste an <em>army</em> of enemies.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gold Saint Virgo Shaka deliberately keeps his eyes closed when he battles his foes — his constant meditation means that he devotes only a fraction of his attention to the outside world. People who know him, even fellow Gold Saints, are <em>very</em> afraid of him opening his eyes, because that means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">he has stopped meditating</a> and is now <em>fully focused</em> on the enemy... And has the power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">easily take on any three Gold Saints</a>.
</li><li> Another <em>Saint Seiya</em> example would be Bronze Saint Andromeda Shun; he literally refuses to wound others or take a life, even when the circumstances call for it, and gets called out on it several times by his foes. There is a theory that he actually mastered the seventh sense (though the fact is never openly stated, it is still highly believable) way before anyone else but always refused to use this tremendous power because of the havoc it could wreak. The first to actually see this is his master to whom Shun said he wanted to show his true power, and his Silver Cloth (remember, Shun is supposed to be a mere Bronze Saint) gets blown to ashes by an imperfect blow ; the second one to see it is Pisces Aphrodite once he destroyed Shun's Cloth and chains, forcing him to unleashing the Nebula Stream and Storm. Cue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> look on his face when he realizes he sort of just removed Shun's wards. His advanced mastery of Cosmo is further supported by the fact that (especially in the manga), at the drop of a hat, he could muster the willpower to land a hit on the Gemini Gold Saint even dimensions, once it was established breaking Gemini's spell would help save Hyoga who was sent in Another Dimension. He then repeats the feat when giving Hyoga, currently a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">Human Popsicle</a> freshly released from an ice coffin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimateHealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimateHealing">Intimate Healing</a>, with a Cosmo burning probably strong enough to rival with Aquarius Camus in the first place to revert the freezing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">Willfully Weak</a> most of the time, and mostly when it comes to fighting, all right.
<ul><li> A smaller example happened during the Black Saints mini-arc, where he held back even his chains due the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> being his brother <em>and</em> being caught by his counterpart while he was trying to save a poisoned Seiya from falling down a cliff. Then Seiya throws himself down and Black Andromeda mocks both of them... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Before dying in a very messy way</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the Gold Saints when faced at the Twelve Temples are an example for reasons different for all Saints: Aries Mu either didn't fight them (manga) or gave them a couple slaps merely to prove they needed to have their cloths repaired; Taurus Aldebaran had doubts on the Pope, and never pressed his advantage when fighting Seiya before conceding the battle; Gemini Saga limited himself to illusions and dimensional tricks <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to hide the fact he was actually the Pope</span> before being forced to stand down by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his other personality</span>; Cancer Death Mask didn't take Shiryuu seriously for a single moment until the latter actually accessed to the strength granted by his Seventh Sense, thus failing to block or dodge the decisive blow; Leo Aiolia had got brainwashed, and decided to torture Seiya to death instead of killing him fast; Virgo Shaka, as explained above, ALWAYS meditates, and it takes Ikki's continuously surviving his attacks to get him to open his eyes and get serious; Scorpio Milo didn't want to kill the Bronze Saints, and held back to try and force them to surrender; Capricorn Shura actually did NOT hold back, failing to stop Seiya, Hyouga and Shun only because Shiryuu thwarted his strategy to line them where he needed them to kill all four with a single strike, and then curbstomped Shiryuu, who had to resort to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to kill him; Aquarius Camus was interested only in testing Hyouga's power, and, after letting Seiya and Shun pass, never pressed his initial advantage (and was quite happy to find that Hyouga had managed to become even more powerful than himself); Pisces Aphrodite, in the end, was just too confident in his roses, resulting in him letting Seiya go in a path filled with poisonous roses (to be fair, only Marin's arrival saved Seiya from death), and trying to simply disarm Shun so he'd stop attacking and die due being poisoned at the start of the battle instead of killing him outright, with the results illustrated above.

She has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman">study martial arts</a> with Sensei Greg so she can fight non-lethally. (Although there's another side to this: the chief difficulty in persuading her to study this wasn't convincing her she might never choose to fight, but that she might fight without the goal of efficiently killing her opponent... which she's already equipped for.)

When he ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">swapping bodies with Luthor</a>, Luthor uses this ability without restraint in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">blow up huge areas of the Tower</a>.
</li><li> The Flash can also accelerate up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousSpeed">light speed</a> if the situation is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">dire enough</a> and he literally transforms into the thunderbolt that is his superhero symbol. It's clear why he normally doesn't: Just running down streets basically causes them to explode from the shockwave, causing untold amounts of damage. It also turns out to be very dangerous to him, so he vows that he can never do it again after the first time.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Naming</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">"World of Cardboard" Speech</a>, Superman explains that he has to be this nearly all the time, because he is <em>so immensely powerful</em> that he has to take extra care not to break the world around him. But since Darkseid can <em>take</em> his strength, he doesn't need to screw around anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> Princess Celestia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> is always portrayed as being extremely powerful; one of her royal duties is raising the sun, which according to <em>The Journal of the Two Sisters</em> used to take whole teams of unicorn wizards working together, and would often have disastrous side effects. Even so, the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E10ARoyalProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E10ARoyalProblem">"A Royal Problem"</a> implies that Celestia holds back considerably because she's actually <em>afraid</em> of just how dangerous she could be if she let herself go.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany">Germany</a> is this considering its population could support a much larger army, and it could have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicHate">nukes</a> in a week if it wanted to. This is because the United States included Germany in its security umbrella and gave the German economy access to the massive U.S. market in order to remove any reason it could have for attempting to change the European status quo again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japan</a> has become this due to the aftermath of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, a combination of limitations on their military enforced by other nations and the aversion their populace has to a more martial lean after the devastation the war wrought on them.
</li><li> Myke Tyson, of all people, could have been this as a child. The book "Momentos Trágicos del deporte" (tragic moments in sports) describes him letting people push him around and going home crying for being bullied. That kept going on until the day somebody thought it was a good idea to mess with his pigeons and made him burst into a fighting machine.
</li><li> Some hunters prefer to use bows because it's the "old-fashioned way", varying from super-modern bows with crazy sights and razor arrows, to old fashion wood and string with feather-fletched arrows.
</li><li> Chinese renminbi. The government enforces that the exchange rate of renminbi is lower than its real value. The purpose is to make Chinese goods very cheap when exported. So far it has been super effective. It's also so they can make sure the money in the hands of their populace (from what little wage they make) is practically worthless and has no buying power.
</li><li> Some martial arts, like Tai Chi, has this. Tai Chi practitioners generally limit themselves to slow, graceful movements that look more like dance than art. This has the advantage of helping to improve form, enhance mastery and even help condition the body as very slow movements are harder to to do than fast or regular movements (for reference, try taking 2 minutes to sit down and stand up instead of 2 seconds). When it's time to get serious, though, Tai Chi masters are a wonder to behold.
<ul><li> Many martial arts have been created directly for the battlefield and had to be "softened" so to be taught and have tournaments without risking to maim and kill the opponent-something that could easily happen even with the <em>normal</em> techniques if they weren't greatly controlled. Just look at the classic Judo <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHQrj09O-g">Ippon Seoi Nage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and imagine it being used against an unsuspecting opponent on hard concrete and not on a softened mat...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MiyamotoMusashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MiyamotoMusashi">Miyamoto Musashi</a> routinely fought duels with a wooden sword against opponents with live steel.
</li><li> When a team in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">National Football League</a></em> wins enough games to clinch the top playoff seed in their conference before their last game of the season, it is a common tactic to bench their starters and play the remainder of their regular season games with second or third string players. This is done to avoid unnecessary injury to their starting lineup in games that are technically irrelevant.
