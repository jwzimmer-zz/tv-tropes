<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> Oriana Thompson is dangerous for, among other things, <em>never</em> using the same magic spell twice due to the nature of her 'Shorthand' flash cards. This makes her very difficult to predict. This ultimately works against her when Touma notices that the way she designed her attacks to be unpredictable means that her attacks never come from the same direction twice in a row — and it's not a conscious choice on her part, but something literally built in. This allows him to dodge her attacks perfectly by running through the space her previous attack covered (though this is only actually explained in the light novels).
</li><li> Acqua of the Back often uses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">water powers</a> to slide around chaotically and make it hard for his opponents to keep track of him.
</li><li> Rensa's facial expression doesn't change, she barely has any body language, and her involuntary muscle movements like blinking and breathing are completely regular. This makes it very difficult to predict her in battle. Ultimately, she can't keep it up forever, especially if she gets upset.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Aiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Aiki">AIKI</a></em>: One of the bizarre training regimens involved doing a crazy dance so that your strikes couldn't be seen.
</li></ul><ul><li> The main character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu">Angel Densetsu</a></em>, Kitano Seiichiro is feared by other delinquents, not because of his terrifying appearance (though that does play a role) so much as his utterly incomprehensible behaviour. The truth of the matter is that Kitano is a genuinely good person who only wants to help others, with an unfortunate tendency to run towards people shrieking incoherently when upset.
</li><li> This is the main danger of the Aberrant Titans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. Most Titans move relatively slowly for their size, grab the closest humans, and attempt to kill them, usually by eating them. Aberrants crawl, jump, run, and have no reasonable pattern to predict who they attack or where they go.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Happens during the fight between Starrk and Kyouraku. After it becomes clear there are a lot of similarities between these two reluctant fighters, Starrk is convinced he's fighting a kindred spirit. Then it's revealed that was a red herring and the only thing they truly have in common is that they're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a>.

Basically everyone's style revolves around this concept, one way or another, although their offensive finishing moves tend to fit the styles' actual description. Fighters who have this as their core fighting style are known as Hajike/Wiggin' Specialists. Their only known natural enemy are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis">Idiot/Joke Killers</a>.

Spike will do anything to distract his opponent — flipping coins, twirling pens, fencing with brooms, kneeling down and looking at nothing to make his opponent try to see what it is, pretending to be asleep or listening to music, even popping open party favors to get a slight edge in a fight. His footwork is fluid and almost prescient, and sometimes even his simple everyday movements like picking up objects seem impossible or like magic. His arms and legs can't be tracked by the eyes, or as he puts it,
<div class="indent"><strong>Spike:</strong> You're not a Chameleon, you know. Can't see everywhere at once.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DiamondNoAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DiamondNoAce">Diamond no Ace</a></em> has this in the form of the main character, Sawamura Eijun. Because he has a flexible body, his pitching form hides his left arm (he is a southpaw) until just before he releases the ball, making the ball seem to start out later and giving the batter less reaction time. Because he didn't have anyone to teach him the nuances of pitching when he was younger, he never learned how grips can change a pitch trajectory, and combined with his naturally flexible body, he grows up throwing a fastball that <em>breaks at random.</em> He supplements this natural pitch with proper inside and outside pitches that even utilize the depth of the strike zone, as well as the changeup, none of which visibly change his pitching form. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later, he learns how to bat from the bunting stance, meaning he's even confusing <em>at bat.</em></span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first Tournament arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Goku and his sensei Master Roshi (in disguise) end up face-to-face in the finals. Both eventually resort to the trope. Since Goku's shown himself to be a <em>very</em> fast learner (copying Roshi's trademark Kamehameha just by watching him do it <em>once</em>), Roshi decides to catch Goku off-guard with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenMaster">Drunken Master</a> technique (something Goku <em>can't</em> imitate because he's never been drunk). But Goku counters with a technique specially suited to him: the Crazy Monkey style (basically, fighting more like a monkey). Now Roshi can't figure Goku out since he's not familiar with living with beasts in the wilderness. Not only that, but in the preliminaries Goku completely stumps an old-fashioned kung-fu master because of his wide open stance and lack of traditional technique. Fortunately, what Goku lacks in formal skill he makes up for with raw talent.
</li><li> Majin Buu, especially in his basic (or Kid Buu) form. The dialogue implies that this isn't the strongest form of Buu, but ends up being the most dangerous by far because there is no reason to his behavior. Of course, the fact that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">violently insane</a> also helps.
</li><li> Before anyone knows who he is, Cell pulls a couple of these on Piccolo, Trunks and the others. Since he has the cells of all of the strongest fighters, he knows almost all of their attacks, many of which are unique to them. He abuses this to get the upper hand on Piccolo whilst in his Imperfect Form. Piccolo at this point is considerably stronger than Cell, but Cell then performs a Kamehameha, which shocks Piccolo enough to allow Cell to grab him. When Trunks and Krillin show up, he then uses Solar Flare to escape.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>. First, there's the Dragonfly formation, which uses two quarterbacks that have to be in synch with one another to allow split-second, unpredictable plays.
</li><li> Natsu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> tries the same trick against a similar opponent — only Natsu can apparently fight quite efficiently when his thought processes shut off. Even better, it doesn't seem like he was actively trying to not think — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">his thoughts stop rather easily.</a> He's also miscalled attacks, misleads his opponents by seeming less skilled/strong than he actually is, and he isn't above dance battling if charging straight at his enemy doesn't work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GateKeepers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GateKeepers">Gate Keepers</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> beats the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Awesomeness by Analysis</a> enemy general because its lack of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> makes it impossible to completely control. The general can't predict its random motions and thus can't hit it or defend against its attacks. The downside to not being able to control the prototype exactly is the risk that the attack you want to make isn't always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">the attack you get</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is the Ooarai tankery team's core strategy, most notably demonstrated in their battle against Kuromorimine. Made necessary by the fact that almost all of their opponents are far better equipped <em>and</em> possess a numerical advantage as well.
</li><li> Like Ooarai, Jatkosota High School's sensha-do team doesn't follow a set strategy in combat, and pretty much makes up things as the battle progresses. Notably, they have fewe numbers and resources even compared to Ooarai, as evidenced by the fact that we only ever see one crewed tank when they fight (their BT-42) and that they keep themselves supplied by plundering their opponents' stockpiles. In <em>Phase Erika</em>, Maho states that despite Jatkosota's lack of unit uniformity and numbers, they shouldn't be underestimated because their commanders have been known to be unorthodox strategists.

</li><li> In the manga match-up of Itagaki vs Saeki, Itagaki has a rough start of it largely because he's an instinctive fighter but the quality of his opponent is making him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma">overthink his moves</a>. Once his trainer gets him past that, however, Itagaki is able to grab the advantage, becoming able to repeatedly hit Saeki because there's no trackable rhythm to his movements. In fact, the only thing going through Itagaki's mind is a one-player game of Shiratori.

He did this by ricocheting his attacks off a wall. Luffy himself didn't know which way they'd ricochet, and therefore had no control over his own attack, which means that Eneru couldn't read his mind to evade them. His first attempt to defeat the mind-reading was to think about nothing, but since this consisted of him turning off his mind dodging only on instinct, he could only move out of the way of the attack and not counter in any way.
</li><li> Due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">rubber body</a> and childish demeanor Luffy often uses unpredictable and just plain weird tactics — like using one of the mooks as a human puppet, or attempting to eat his opponent, who is invulnerable to regular attacks. Several times he gains an advantage in battle simply because the enemy doesn't take his new technique seriously until the first hit.
</li><li> Usopp, not being one of the (as he calls them) super-powered freaks of the crew, utilizes a mixture of various gadgets and just plain trickery, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">calling out the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">wrong</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">attack name,</a> playing dead and randomly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">flicking rubber bands at his opponents.</a>

<ul><li> Often seen in the chess world. Many's the amateur who succeeds through offbeat play, and even at the grandmaster level, some players favour bizarre openings like 1. b4. A 19th-century example, William Potter, is described in <em>Lasker's Manual of Chess</em>:
<div class="indent"><em>Potter probably saw through the emptiness and the presumption of the style then dominating and with his style of play he seemed to call out to his contemporaries: "You want to beat me right from the start by force of your greater genius? Look! I make ridiculous moves, and yet you cannot beat me. Become, I pray you, more modest and more reasonable."</em>
</div></li><li> Though not nearly as often as popular culture would think it happens. While you can certainly irritate grandmasters with offbeat variants in the opening, leading them astray from their vast knowledge (and often crazy preparedness) about mainstream openings, trying confusion fu later in the game will way more often than not lose you the game in a single move without you even realizing it. The problem is that the general knowledge (as opposed to the specific knowledge of Lasker's time) got way more advanced during the last century.
</li><li> Chess-playing computers play like this — not bound to any strategy or school, but simply by picking the moves that will, in the long run, have the greatest chance of success. Or should have... Kasparov did win his 3rd and 4th games in a 4-game match against a computer by ensuring that there was no positive history for the computer to rely on in the games they'd played — and going into purer Shrodinger Fu than the computer was designed for netted him a win while playing black. Future iterations do not have this vulnerability; it is currently pretty much impossible for an unassisted human to beat a dedicated chess computer, and <em>phone apps</em> have won Grand Master tournaments by a landslide.
</li><li> Google's <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo">Go-playing program<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had a similar effect. It completely ignores normal board control strategies and the current point balance while it made the moves it calculated were most likely to lead to final victory, and as a result nobody had any idea what the hell it was doing until it won. Several moves that were, in retrospect, core to its victory were thought to be mistakes at the time because they gave up points.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">Poker</a>, the most dangerous players at the table are the ones who always call and raise at random. It's impossible to tell whether they have a good hand, so calling their raise is a very risky business — but at the same time, folding means you'll lose your earlier investment when they could easily just be sitting on a high card. Aside from that, online players who sit down at physical tables tend to completely ignore their opponents' physical expressions and focus on their betting patterns, simply because you can't read people online. This tends to throw off live players, though it can also create an exploitable weakness because the online players don't train themselves to get rid of their own tells.

This is even more true for fighters who rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">reading</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance">predicting</a> their opponents moves as the Joker was able to catch Cassandra Cain, who was even better than her mother Lady Shiva, off guard. In these instances, the only way to beat the Joker is to take a more simplistic approach or get him angry and let him attack you first.
<div class="indent"><strong>Black Canary:</strong> What's wrong with her? I thought she could beat anybody? She should be able to drop the Joker in a hot New York minute. <br/><strong>Batman:</strong> Almost anybody. Batgirl reads body language. She knows what her opponents will do before they do it. She can read his too. But the Joker's body language makes no sense. It's jibberish.
</div><ul><li> This especially extends to Joker's arsenal. Most villains have a gimmick that they'll stick to no matter what. Poison Ivy will always do something involving plants, Penguin will always do something involving birds, etc. Meanwhile, Joker will use guns, knives, explosives, whoopie cushions, buzzers, laughing gas, jet packs, anything he feels like using or has within reach at the moment. Half the time they don't even work because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In one comic, Joker played chess with Ras Al Ghul. Despite Ras being very, very good at chess, Joker beat him by using random moves which Ras couldnt effectively counter. Ras didnt seem too upset about it, however.
</li><li> Tim Drake managed to overcome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Cassandra Cain's</a> bodyreading ability by throwing out all style and just going with what felt natural, despite the fact that this is not how her abilities work.
</li><li> Batman himself is sometimes portrayed this way, not due to his moves being random, but due to the fact that he sticks to the shadows and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">employs gadgetry.</a> You might know Batman is stalking you, but you don't know which direction that Batarang/gas grenade/grapple/fist is coming from. He's been known to, among other things, trick an opponent (like Wonder Woman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">alternate universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">counterpart</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueCrisisOnTwoEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueCrisisOnTwoEarths">Superwoman</a>) coup with super-breath into thinking he was using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokeOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokeOut">smoke bomb to cover his escape</a>.

Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">to extremes</a> in the DC/Wildstorm crossover, where Midnighter takes one look at the Joker, tries to predict him and has a <em>petit mal</em> seizure (think of a computer lagging to a freezing halt, which was literally what (probably) happened here).

A particularly nonsensical example was the ability to turn people into toilets with flowers in them. In fact, her ability was so chaotic, it was only defeated by the power of Lists. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol">Doom Patrol</a> fought her by running away and yelling out powers, so she couldn't use them.

He then proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBitesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBitesMan">take a big bite out of Bronze Tiger's jugular</a>.

</li><li> In the Brian Bendis series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MoonKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MoonKnight">Moon Knight</a></em>, the title character can manifest the personalities of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> and, so doing, adopts their weapons and fighting styles. To say that this is unexpected by his opponents is an understatement. It also saves his life several times when fighting Count Nefaria.
</li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, with his speed, agility, spider-sense and ability to climb or swing anywhere he wants, he has often invoked this trope with opponents having difficulty predicting his movements.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em> story arc where the league had to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a>'s alter ego Fernus the Burning, Batman found a solution to fighting a shapeshifter who could predict your every move by reading your mind: bring in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan">Plastic Man</a>, a shapeshifter whose mind is so chaotic that his thoughts bear little connection to his actions.
</li><li> In a couple <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a></em> books, it's stated that this trope is the main advantage of "ugly" starfighters. In a straight comparison, an ugly is a definitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a>, being cobbled together from spare parts of other fighters and having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">all the reliability you'd expect of that.</a> But because seemingly every one is unique, and they bug out constantly, it makes them pretty unpredictable in combat - your targeting computer finally thinks it's got a tracer on this ship that isn't quite like anything in its database, and then its engine craps out for a second right before you can fire and your missiles streak directly in front of it.
</li><li> In Veys and Barral's <em>Baker Street</em>a parodic take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>Holmes has to travel back from Ceylan to Bombay, with Moriarty trying to stop him. He openly admits planning is useless, and chooses to rely on a deck of cards upon which all sort of random actions have been written. Some of the things we see, though the cards are not read aloud, include a music hall number, performing a dragon dance (in the heart of India!) and <em>sliding down an Himalayan mountain on an overturned grand piano</em>. Moriarty is suitably distressed:

Twilight even invokes this trope when they're planning to fight Discord (and makes good use of it later with her vast amount of spells) because any well laid plan is destined to fail in this situation.

He flails about so wildly that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">Bond</a> can't really fight him effectively — that is, until the <em>downside</em> of wild flailing is illustrated, when the villain performs an inadvertent axe-foot interface that is excruciating to watch.

By playing quickly it's possible to drastically shorten the time a computer has to process and so force them to make worse moves because they had to play before they finished calculating. This has proven effective against Big Blue and similar computers.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Baseball</a>:
<ul><li> There are a handful of baseball pitchers who throw the knuckleball. Essentially throwing the ball with no spin, this allows the ball's imperfections (mostly the seams) to determine the flight path. Such pitches are so unpredictable that even the pitcher doesn't know where they'll end up, with the catcher usually having to wear an oversize mitt to help snag them. In fact, some batters take the day off when a knuckleballer is scheduled to pitch against their team, rather than have their timing and instincts ruined for the next several games.
</li><li> Even more so is the spitball. Similar to the knuckleball, it has an unpredictable trajectory, but because it doesn't require a special grip to be thrown, it can be thrown at higher speeds, and due to the dirt, grime, and tobacco juice that accumulates on the ball, it is more difficult to see. It is banned from most professional leagues due to this fact - a spitball <em>killed</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Chapman">Ray Chapman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during a poorly lit game after going astray and hitting him in the head, resulting in its ban in 1920. Its equivalent is still legal in Cricket, with certain exceptions (for instance, gouging the ball with your fingernails is unacceptable, while spitting on one side and polishing the other against your trousers is no issue).
</li><li> "Effectively wild" baseball pitchers, who have great breaking-ball stuff or high velocity and terrible command, work this on hitters. Better offensive teams and pitchers can usually shell a wild pitcher with trained plate discipline and waiting out a pitcher to walk guys on or lay a mistake down the heart of the plate, but most league-average players will usually chase their bad balls out of the zone and work their own way into trouble, either out of a sense of aggressiveness in anticipation of getting a mistake to hit or a ball being just close enough to the strike zone to chase. Whereas more effective pitchers will execute a game-plan that involves intentionally throwing balls to fool the hitter and the hitter countering by trying to figure out the plan of attack, wild pitchers with no semblance of control usually befuddle hitters into having no clue if they're getting a ball or strike in any count and it throws their usual hitting approach out of whack.
</li><li> Jim Bouton wrote in <em>Ball Four</em> of his teammate Mike Marshall's belief that the most effective way to keep a hitter from dialing in was to throw pitches in a completely random non-pattern irrespective of the count.
</li><li> Deceptive windups and pitch timings are an attempt to manually create confusion in the batters. Johnny Cueto is a master of this sort of pitching, varying his windup timings, how much he turns his body, and what arm angle he releases the ball from with basically every pitch, to the point that he sometimes turns entirely around to face the center-field camera and then <em>shimmys</em> before letting the ball go (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWKwTrFssH0">as seen here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). Ditto guys like Yusmeiro Petit and Grant Dayton, whose pitching motion makes the ball seem to disappear behind their bodies and reappear at their release point, making their fastball become what's colloquially known as an "invisiball".
</li></ul></li><li> In cricket, some fast bowlers like to bowl the ball so that the seam (which on a cricket ball is much more prominent than on a baseball, running straight around the circumference of the ball) strikes the ground on the bounce, producing a pretty unpredictable bounce on the right kind of pitch. Of course, this makes it unlikely to direct itself towards the stumps, but the idea is to hope that a batter will take a swing at the ball and 'edge' it, resulting in an easy catch for the wicket keeper. Such a tactic is, as you'd expect, known as 'seam bowling' and the bowler who uses it a 'seamer'.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanFootball">American Football</a>:
<ul><li> The Wildcat Formation. There are four main plays (two rushing, two passing) that can be run from the Wildcat Formation, and all of them look exactly the same until the play is actually executed, making it difficult for the defense to anticipate what they must do. The Wildcat is an interesting example. After seeing Ronnie Brown and the Miami Dolphins paste the recently near-undefeated New England Patriots with the Wildcat in 2008, several other teams misunderstood the <em>reason</em> it worked (the Dolphins simply surprised the Patriots with a scheme they had not thought to prepare for) and began to implement the Wildcat into their normal offensive playbooks. Once defensive coaches had a few weeks to study the Wildcat, defenses adjusted to counter the Wildcat and offenses designed around it were stopped cold. Today, the Wildcat is almost entirely out of vogue... which means that if a team is very careful about using it sparingly, it can still be an effective surprise attack.
</li><li> There are a surprising number of Confusion Fu techniques in American Football, and almost every play utilizes them to some extent. Many running patterns are designed to confuse the defense and make them lose track. Beyond known plays such as the play action (start with what looks like a run play, but then go to a pass) the draw (the converse, fall back like you're about to pass while you're actually executing a running play), a quarterback can use his eyes or do a pump fake to fool an unsuspecting defensive player to think he will throw in a certain direction. He may also alter his pre-snap cadence to make it harder for the defense to time the snap. He may fake a handoff, then run the ball himself (a "bootleg"). Running backs will follow a blocking pattern until the defense adjusts to it, and then cut back and run the other way. Receivers will make moves to throw a defensive back off his coverage. Sometimes two or more receivers will cross routes, making it difficult for all the defenders to track them. Skilled defenders are just as capable of utilizing confusion by continually moving before the snap, or lining up in an apparent zone and then blitzing through linemen not expecting a strong pass rush.
</li><li> The zone read and option plays, which figure heavily into college football (with the former becoming more prevalent in the pro game with the advent of mobile quarterbacks), which allows the quarterback to read the defense and then decide after the snap and the defense commits whether to hang onto the ball or give it off to a tailback. This gets even more headache-inducing for the defense with the option, since the quarterback and tailback are running parallel to each other so that the quarterback can A) keep it and run if the defender chooses to stay with the tailback or B) if the defense commits to the quarterback, wait until he's about to be tackled before pitching it to the tailback, allowing him a lot of space to run with one less defender to worry about.
</li><li> And then there's just doing something so completely unexpected that the defense has no idea what's going on. Case in point? <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UIdI8khMkw">This.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Every team will have a couple trick or gadget plays that rely on this in their playbook (the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuDFd9zL2HA">Statue of Liberty play<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, for example), even up to the professional level. Such shenanigans are generally frowned upon, however, as when they fail they tend to fail catastrophically (and additionally make the playcaller look like an idiot).
</li><li> A much more commonly used trick/gadget play is the Flea Flicker, in which the quarterback hands off or laterals the ball to a running back or a receiver, who then laterals it back to the quarterback who throws it deep to another receiver who ran down the field during this process. While the play is confusing enough that it usually results in big gains when it works, it can also easily be disrupted by a defense that's prepared for it because of how long it takes, and if the defense covers the deep receiver (or receivers) well enough, it can easily lead to an interception. A slight variant on the play that is used much more rarely will have the player the QB gave the ball throwing it deep themselves rather than pitching it back to the QB, which is quite a bit riskier because of the non-QB throwing the ball, but it can sometimes work amazingly well if the thrower has enough skill. And even more rarely, you'll see that play used with the QB himself going deep down the field to be the target for the receiver he originally lateraled the ball to, as in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf679c6BG3I">this play<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i7VKQwDS2s&amp;nohtml5=False">This play<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - whatever it was intended to do - shows that confusion for the sake of confusion is not a successful tactic. There are probably three people in the world who understand this play. One is in an insane asylum, the other is dead and the third has forgotten all about it.
</li><li> Due to the fact that defensive positions are a lot less fixed than offensive, defenses perform Confusion Fu on a much more consistent basis than offenses. A common tactic is to present one type of defensive coverage before the snap and then shift to a different one after the snap, or to have players show blitz before dropping into coverage.
</li></ul></li><li> Retired fighter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Genki Sudo</a> owed most of his striking success to this tactic, being primarily a grappler. It was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_eOOSW6eDA">awesome to watch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Many of his tactics, though not all, are against the rules in a regular tennis match.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Capoeira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Capoeira">Capoeira</a> has much the same thought in mind with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler">Dance Battler</a> making you hard to predict because you are always in motion. Also for the sheer fun of it.
</li><li> In game theory, this is known as a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_%28game_theory%29#Mixed_strategy">mixed strategy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. For example, in rock-paper-scissors, if you went with a pure strategy, such as always picking rock, anyone who knows your strategy could easily beat you. If you use a mixed strategy, and pick rock a third of the time, paper a third of the time, and scissors a third of the time, then there's no strategy that can consistently beat you. In more complex games, there are more complex mixed strategies, where not all choices are picked with the same probability.
<ul><li> Do make sure, though, that you are truly randomizing whether you pick rock, paper, or scissors - if you're just going in a predictable pattern (i.e., 1st round rock, 2nd round paper, 3rd round scissors, 4th round rock, etc.), or even adhere <em>too</em> strictly to the 1/3 probability guideline (to the point where every three throws feature rock, paper, and scissors in some order), astute opponents will pick up on it and pre-empt you.
</li><li> Another example is from soccer penalty kicks. Because the shot is taken from so close, the goalie has to decide whether to go left or right as they will not have time to react if they wait until ball is kicked. Meanwhile, the kicker has to decide whether to aim for the left corner or the right corner. Both players randomize which way to go based on the probabiities of scoring. Research has shown that professionals move to the left or right with a frequency that is within 1% of what game theory predicts.
<ul><li> This is discussed by the authors of the Freakonomics blog in <em>Think Like a Freak</em>, then invoked. If you're the kicker, and you know the keeper will almost certainly either dodge left or right, where should you aim? Right down the middle. They give several reasons for why players rarely use this tactic, one of which is the fear of shame (and an angry crowd) at kicking the ball dead center and having the keeper catch it easily.
</li><li> Probably the gutsiest penalty kick down the middle was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd1Hr96IenI">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from Czechoslovak Antonin Panenka at the <em>final</em> of the Euro 1976. It worked and it beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">Germany</a> in the only penalty shootout they ever lost. Maybe England should hire Panenka as a penalty shootout coach.

His amateur kung fu-based fighting style has been described as "capoeira-esque", using all kind of attacks from absurd angles and making a deep use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning">Spectacular Spinning</a>.
</li><li> This is a good volleyball setter's job. If it is obvious which attacker he/she is setting, they will probably be blocked. The set should <em>look</em> obvious, but be misleading, so that the blockers will go up against the wrong player.

Tzeentch represents change, sometimes simply for its own sake, but he also happens to be the setting's ultimate planner. It is said that every action, no matter how random, is all part of Tzeentch's plan. Even the times when his forces lose terribly (which may have the effect of killing off a weaker champion so a greater one will rise, or overstretching a foe so they can be defeated by a different force later). As such, it seems to be impossible to beat Tzeentch because even a victory will be playing into his ultimate plan. Of course, authors can't seem to agree on what the ultimate goal of Tzeentch's plans are (or if he even has one), which means he's either the universe's greatest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> or an esoteric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Mad God</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> An old staple of the game, starting with 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, is the Wild Mage. Conceptually, his casting power level is modified by a die roll whenever casting a spell, and each spell has a small chance of producing a "wild surge", which is something completely random from a long list. The original list had 100 entries, but various fan-made lists on the Internet are far longer. Then he gets a spell that does nothing <em>except</em> produce a random effect.
</li><li> In 4<sup>th</sup> edition, this is severely toned down. The "Chaos Sorcerer" has numerous random effects (such as attacks that deal damage of a random element) but lacks true wild effects because they don't fit the strict ruleset, or because they would be disadvantageous to the caster. Usually a player character (and this can be highly frustrating to the <em>other</em> player characters), but there's nothing stopping the Dungeon Master from throwing one at you. The new Chaos Sorcerer has an element of unpredictability in most of his attacks. Heck, every attack you make has a 10% chance of moving <em>everyone</em> on the battlefield either toward you or away from you.
</li><li> Before that, there was the Wand of Wonder, which was Wild Magic on a Stick. Best used when desperate... or bored.
</li><li> The Wild Mage in <em>D&amp;D</em> Miniatures also has the Wild Surge, but its effect simply modifies spell damage. Contrasted with the Green Slaad, a chaos monster whose spells also have random effects but could include <em>fireballing</em> your own army.
</li><li> Speaking of Slaadi, as embodiements of pure Chaos they do <em>everything</em> this way. This should certainly include fighting. In 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em>, Slaadi were discussed as having utterly chaotic personalities, but preferring to fight their enemies one-on-one in slugging matches just so each <em>individual</em> would prove how tough he was.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> in its various expansions discussed how Confusion Fu is actually a <em>weakness</em> of the tanar'ri (demons). Their unpredictability meant they can't get together and make a plan against their enemies, as they go off and do whatever they felt like. Even a bad plan is better than disorder, and their enemies (the devils) usually have excellent plans. Every once in a while, the tanar'ri do something absolutely brilliant out of sheer chaos, but most of the times they simply rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>.
</li><li> The 3.5<sup>th</sup> edition sourcebook <em>Complete Warrior</em> includes "Drunken Master" as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a>. Among their abilities, Drunken Masters are very skilled with improvised weapons, can stagger into a fight to surprise their opponents, or waive and bob unpredictably to avoid blows.
</li><li> In editions 13.5, an inexperienced player playing an illusionist will have trouble figuring out what to do with the class. A good illusionist will have the party's enemies chasing shadows, running into walls, falling off cliffs, and attacking their allies by mistake long before reaching 5<sup>th</sup> level. Unlike some Confusion Fu classes, the illusionist has to confuse his enemies with well-controlled and clever use of his powers, not rely on randomness.
</li><li> The Grimalkin is a shapeshifter whose true form is a large blue-gray housecat, but which can turn into any animal close in size. When forced into combat, they go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetuallyProtean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetuallyProtean">Perpetually Protean</a> by changing shape every round, to confuse the opponent and make it difficult to adopt a strategy.

<ul><li> The Brawler class (a hybrid of the Fighter and Monk classes) more-or-less has this as its primary class feature.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>:
<ul><li> The flavor text for Spiraling Duelist alludes to this: "I never move the same way twice. The rotters can't grasp chaos."
</li><li> From an actual gameplay sense, this can come up in tournaments thanks to so called 'rogue' decks. Every deck has things it can't deal with, so there's a 'sideboard' of 15 cards that can be swapped into the deck between games to help deal with the opponent's deck in any given match. Some players are able to devastate tournaments by using new strategies that players don't have a way to counter with their sideboard. Of course, the deck has to be powerful enough to beat the unsideboarded version of the top decks as well...
</li><li> This also tends to be a favorite trick of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntropyAndChaosMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntropyAndChaosMagic">Red</a>, which can cast cards from the top of its library, transform creatures into other, random creatures and gain boosts based on random effects, such as coin flips. This can come as quite a wakeup call for an opponent expecting every Red deck to fall into its terminally predictable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a> reputation.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, when you declare the target of an effect (when you activate a card but before its effect resolves), your opponent can Chain cards according to your target to counter it. If your card requires selecting a random target, or performs an action without needing a target, your opponent will not be able to play around it as effectively as you will only decide what to go for after they have finished their response.
</li><li> In the game <em>Flash Duel</em>, most characters have abilities that strengthen or debuff their opponents in a fantasy style sparing match. Lum's abilities plays a different game altogether. One ability allows the player to win for having a Poker Flush, or his other ability (out of three) gives your opponent a chance to forfeit the match to avoid losing the game!
</li><li> <em>Codex: Card Time Strategy</em> (another game by Dave Sirlin) has <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sirlin.net/posts/codex-anarchy-spec">the entire Anarchy spec<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> themed around chaos and unpredictability. One of its iconic spells throws <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark">two sharks</a> out of nowhere at the opponent. The flavour text explicitly invokes this trope:
<div class="indent"><em>"When you do something they don't expect, they have to actually think about how to respond. Most people aren't equipped to actually think if their precious plan goes wrong." - Captain Zane</em>
</div><ul><li> Zane likes this trope. Another of his pieces of flavour text is pithier:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoIdeaWhatImDoing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoIdeaWhatImDoing">Do I look like someone with a plan? I just DO things.</a>" - Captain Zane</em>
</div></li><li> Zig-zagged in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Burn Legend</a>. While the completely random "pick a move arbitrarily" system tends to fade away as players gain more experience and begin planning out what counters they're likely to need next turn, randomly chosen moves still have their place — occasionally you'll pick a move that counters <em>their</em> move, when they thought they were countering <em>yours</em>. Of course, just as often you'll pick moves that have nothing to do with each other. Tennin tend to be the worst at this, since their combat style is heavily formalised.
</li><li> Arc dodgers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/XWingMiniatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/XWingMiniatures">X-Wing Miniatures</a></em> rely on this. The best arc-dodgers - Soontir Fel's TIE Interceptor and Fenn Rau's Concord Dawn Protectorate Starfighter - have both boost and barrel roll actions, making them really good at repositioning on the fly, and a high Pilot Skill, allowing them to see where the enemy goes before deciding how to reposition. Han Solo's "Heroes of the Resistance" version will have a similar effect; his ability to deploy <em>anywhere</em> outside of weapons range of enemy ships - at Pilot Skill 9, the highest unmodified PS in the game - means that wherever your opponent wants him to start, he won't; you'll almost always have at minimum half the table to deploy in.
<ul><li> The TIE Striker ace pilot Duchess can be remarkably slippery. The TIE Striker's unique Title, Adaptive Ailerons, means that unless it's stressed, it <em>must</em> move 1 straight or bank before carrying out its move. This means that it can start its formal move in any of three different places, and it has quite a variety of moves - you could, for example, bank left and follow up with a left-arcing Segnor's loop to move from being in front of your enemy to being beside them. So far, so good; however, Duchess has the additional benefit of being able to ignore the Ailerons if she pleases!

For example, it's not unheard of for people to bring a weapon like a cestus, which is equipped to both hands when you two-hand it and can parry in the off-hand, then get a second copy and equip it in that off-hand, so you don't know when they're using the two-handed moveset and when they're able to parry. Some bosses are also good at it, despite the focus on readability in boss design; for example, the Twin Princes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> constantly teleport around the arena, and you don't know when they teleport if they're going to set up a way off and charge a big attack or if they're just going to drop on your head, sword outstretched.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> 2</em>: In "Last Stand" mode, the hero Ork Mekboy has two types of teleporter armor. The standard "Teleporta Pack" allows controllable teleporting within a certain range. The other is the "Mad Teleporta Pack"; this grants the Reactive Escape and Reactive Teleport traits. The former trait is a 15% chance to teleport the mekboy to a random nearby location when the Mekboy is hit by a melee attack whilst the latter is a 50% chance to teleport the <em>attacker</em> to a random nearby location when the Mekboy is hit by a melee attack. The result of this is that when fighting a wave primarily composed of melee troops both you and your opponents are being more or less constantly teleported around the arena with absolutely no control over it. Its worth noting that from a practical perspective this is probably not a very helpful piece of equipment as it is just as likely to throw you into danger as get you out of it.
<ul><li> This has improved even further lately with the "Juiced up tellyporta" accessory which adds the "Ported!!" trait. Now the act of teleporting anything causes it to explode at the end of its journey. This includes both enemies and yourself. So now not only do melee enemies get randomly teleported away but the majority instantly die at the end of it in an explosion. And if you yourself get teleported you blow up anything you teleport into.

His meteors don't hit you, they hit <em>around</em> you and fly at you after bouncing on the ground. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">EX Mode</a> ability makes all of his attacks even <em>crazier</em>; his fireballs multiply after being thrown, that ice shrapnel homes in you on a second time after the initial shatter, and those meteors bounce in place when they land before zooming at you. There's a reason his fighting style is dubbed "Mad Mage" and others calling his attacks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">being hit with magical awesome</a>.
<ul><li> The sequel, <em>Dissidia 012</em>, gave this attribute to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Gilgamesh</a>. With every melee attack, he picks a random weapon out of eight, each with varying effects. The Naginata has increased attack range, Masamune gives you double EX Force from hits, Excalibur does double damage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">Excalipoor does one damage with every hit</a>, and so on. However, unlike Kefka, Gilgamesh becomes <em>more</em> predictable in EX Mode, choosing a set of weapons and sticking with it until he reverts to his normal form.
</li></ul></li><li> In the online MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dofus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dofus">Dofus</a></em>, there's a class based on doing damage on the roll of a die or the flip of a coin called Ecaflip's Coin. Two attacks even go out and heal the target after it damages it.
</li><li> The Rogue class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, even ignoring their skillset, have an unpredictable, acrobatic range to their attacks that make them impossible to counter. Adding in Subterfuge, Sabotage and Scoundrel gives them more means to sow confusion and keep on the move in battle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elements">Elements</a></em> majority of cards in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntropyandChaosMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntropyandChaosMagic">entropy deck</a> seems to be geared for pure chaos. It has two attacking spells - one that inflicts random negative effect on a target creature, and one that does it to every creature, including your own. It has a spell that can turn target creature into abomination (which, depending on the creature can be an improvement or an impairment), turn it into randomly chosen creature with a randomly chosen skill (which can be something weak and useless or a powerful dragon with ability to <em>multiply</em>) or just kill it - and resut, is once again, chosen randomly. It has spells, that can turn situation on its head - like spell that gives ability to destroy buildings and artifacts to a creatures with a weak attack (thus making small and weak creatures dangerous) or a spell, that makes target's attack negative, meaning that its attacks will <em>heal you</em> instead of damaging (thus turning a danger into the sourse of health). And on top of all that, entropy artifact weapon is a magic sword that randomly converts some of oponent's quanta (this game equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a>) into other elemental types - and since most of the cards require certain amount of specific elemental quanta to be used, it makes strategizing pointless, since at any moment resourses, needed to cast a spell or summon a creature, can be transformed into something useless. As a result, when other decks use some kind of strategy, which can be anticipated and countered, entropy is constantly changing the course of the fight, both intentionally and unintentionally, rendering any strategy useless.
</li><li> MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em> is notoriously immune to this, ship fittings are crucial to attaining victory, meaning ship fits done poorly will simply result in newbies being crushed (this is of course, a game where a group of low experience players can take down a veteran, since combat mechanics are not reliant on experience point total or reflexes). This is part of what makes the game infamous for its brutal <a class="urllink" href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3088/2335016192_6003c39c4c_z.jpg?zz=1">learning curve.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Great players play this straight - Bad players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategySchmategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategySchmategy">simply don't know what they're doing</a> and aren't really invoking this trope in the first place. Good players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">know what tactics work and stick to them</a> making them easily figured out and planned against. Great players know that being predictable means your enemy likely knows how to counter what you plan to do, so liberal doses of randomness can keep them guessing and score impressive victories with bizarre strategies that shouldn't actually work.

<ul><li> Most Nobodies in have some degree of unpredictability, due to their random stretching and boneless flailing.

Or perhaps he'll use Megaflare and then some unavoidable thing before you can cast Curaga. Or maybe he'll just do a random combo of all of these while having ten copies of himself running around the field doing each their own thing as little balls of light fly around trying to stab you with more spears, lagging your PSP to high-heaven.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy">Rinzler</a>, who has a rather weird flipping attack style that hits at strange times (and hits <em>hard</em>), which is not helped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">changing gravity</a>. No wonder he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>.
</li><li> Sora himself has shades of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>. Many of the Reaction Commands against bosses involve him befuddling his opponents and redirecting their attacks or stealing their weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> While he's fairly straightforward in other aspects, Wukong from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> has one move that uses this heavily: Decoy. It turns him invisible, but leaves a copy of him that explodes after a few seconds. If Wukong's opponents are not paying much attention he can make them just waste attacks and spells on his copy then get hurt by the following explosion. Or he can use the period of invisibility to get to cover, change directions after casting it to throw pursuers off his trail, <em>not</em> change directions because they'll think you did, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow">variations thereupon</a>, or not cast it at all. The ability looks the same as if you had suddenly stopped moving, so some people will stop and their enemy will ignore the real Wukong to chase after an imaginary invisible one.
<ul><li> Also present in juking that any champ can do, changing directions at unpredictable times to throw off aim, or times where it's predictable that the enemy would attack (preemptively dodging as soon as you're in range is a fairly effective example), or changing direction the moment the enemy loses sight of you all help to dodge attacks and confuse the enemy.
</li><li> Shaco is very adept at confusing the hell out of his enemies. He can clone himself, and the duplicate can attack but cannot use abilities. If the clone dies and he is in a tough spot, he can turn invisible—possibly to escape or to kill an unsuspecting player. He also does increased damage when attacking from behind, delivering a healthy dosage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Paranoia Fuel</a> as well.
</li><li> Similarly, LeBlanc, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">The Deceiver,</a> has a kit that is designed to invoke this in the right hands. Her passive, Mirror Image, activates when she drops below 40% health. She stealths for one second, and when she reappears, she spawns a controllable clone of herself that deals no damage, forcing enemies to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter">Spot the Imposter</a>, let her escape, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">kill them both,</a> which is unfeasible at lower levels and may result in wasted cooldowns and mana. She also has an ability called Distortion, which dashes her forward a short distance, leaving a pad on the ground. Within 4 seconds, she can reactivate the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">teleport</a> back to her starting pad. Enemies now have to choose whether to aim their attacks at where she dashed to or where she started from, which a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">savvy</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes">quick</a> LeBlanc can use to her advantage. Add to that her ultimate, Mimic, which allows her to copy her last used ability, and now you have many more possibilities for jukes and tricks. Add to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">that</a></em> the fact that it's possible to reduce the cooldowns of both those abilities by up to 40% and you have the means to create a veritable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">Teleport Spam</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheLegendReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheLegendReturns">Lufia: The Legend Returns</a></em>, Ruby has a few moves that rely on pure chance, such as "Fortune Dice", which simply has randomized effects, and "Double Up", which makes you play a card-guessing game to increase the power of the attack - a good run can be incredibly devastating, but guess wrong even once and you get a laughably weak attack. Of course, she's a habitual gambler whom you meet in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasinoPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasinoPark">a casino</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>: This trope is directly discussed by Joker and EDI. While EDI can control the ship all by herself, the <em>Normandy</em> can achieve maximum performance if Joker is manning the helm.
<ul><li> In the previous game, you can get this effect from the Mako APC. The handling is so bad that even you probably have no idea where you're going next, so the enemy are going to have serious trouble anticipating your next movement.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> games that involve a light/dark system, one side effect of going dark is the ability to pull random Battle Chips out of goddamn <em>nowhere</em>. When you fight a DS Navi (most often MegaMan's own dark side), you can be moments from winning, only to get slaughtered by a GigaChip. But since this is random, DS Navis are just as likely to use low-level chips or miss you completely. If you choose to go dark yourself, you get the same ability in a modified form — your dark side will take over when your HP runs out, fighting randomly for a while. In this case you'd better hope for <em>good</em> random draws, because you come out of berserk mode with just 1 HP.
</li><li> Claymores in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em> online are only dangerous when placed at precise angles around corners... or in the middle of the ground with no rhyme or reason.
</li><li> Havok from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatDeception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatDeception">Deception</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatArmageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatArmageddon">Armageddon</a></em> is basically <em>Mortal Kombat</em>'s answer to Voldo: A rotting corpse that rotates its limbs and neck, making it extremely unpredictable and visually unsettling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some Pokémon do this. Mew can learn all TM and HM moves in the game and has the stats to do fine in whichever archetype it needs. Smeargle takes this even further; while its stats are much worse, it learns Sketch, which permanently copies a move and can be used to learn <em>almost any move that exists in the game</em>. (Save Sketch itself and Chatter)
</li><li> In competitive battling, the Pokémon capable of this typically have reasonable offenses in either spectrum and/or defenses that they have multiple possible competitive movesets which, in extreme cases, require different counters. Due to the guesswork involved, you might inevitably lose at least one Pokémon to them due to learning the moveset one turn too late.
<ul><li> Mega Charizard takes this to a different level, having two different Mega Evolutions each with different abilities, weaknesses, and stat spreads. Guessing wrongly commonly leads to Mega Charizard X setting up a Swords Dance or Dragon Dance to sweep with, or Mega Charizard Y obliterating you with a sun-empowered STAB Fire Blast.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, Arceus's ability, Multitype, allows it to become any one of the 18 elemental Pokémon types, providing that it is holding the corresponding Plate or Z-Crystal for each type (i.e., Draco Plate/Dragonium Z for Dragon-type). Silvally, an artifical Pokémon based on Arceus in-universe, can likewise change its type (though it uses Memory discs instead).
</li><li> Zoroark, introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em>, evokes this at times, as its ability, Illusion, pushes players to carefully discern whether they are actually facing the Pokémon they are <em>seeing</em> or a Zoroark in disguise instead.
</li><li> Metronome is an attack capable of causing the Pokémon to use <em>any</em> available move in the game. The move Assist has a similar but more controlled effect, as the Pokémon using it will pull off a random move from any of its party member's current movepools. Sleep Talk is a very minor example of this, as it uses one of the user's <em>other</em> moves at random.
<ul><li> Played with in the anime, where May's Munchlax and Skitty probably won more contests with Metronome and Assist (respectively) than without.
</li></ul></li><li> Greninja can become a master in this thanks to its Hidden Ability, Protean. While Greninja is normally Water/Dark, Protean allows it to change into the type of whatever move it's about to use. Since Greninja can outspeed 97% of the entire Pokedex, and its movepool includes everything from Flying to Psychic, this means it can pretty much turn into any type that would screw over its opponent the most, <em>especially</em> opponents with a type advantage over it.
<ul><li> Greninja can also pull a similar trick as Charizard in that it can also transform into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Ash-Greninja</a> if it has Battle Bond as an ability instead. This allows for a mind game where the opponent needs to determine if its a Greninja that can change its typing or one that can access a form similar to a Mega.
</li></ul></li><li> Necrozma can mess with a player, especially Dusk Mane Necrozma. Though it can use Ultra Burst to become Ultra Necrozma whenever it wants to (provided it holds Ultranecrozium Z), thanks to its bulk it can safely set up status buffs first. An opponent can be fooled into thinking it holds something else, only to face up against a giant light dragon. Likewise, anticipating its transformation can lead to a STAB Sunsteel Strike mowing down their Fairy-type.
</li><li> Much like Protean Greninja, Libero Cinderace has the ability to change its type based on the move it uses (normally pure Fire), and outspeeds a nice chunk of the Pokemon that can visit Galar. While a tad slower than its predecessor, its physical attacks hit harder, especially its trademark moves Pyro Ball and G-Max Fireball (and the latter ignores abilities, so leave Flash Fire at home). While Water and Dragon are its defensive gaps, that's still a lot of Pokemon it can flatten on its own.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Showderp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Showderp">Showderp</a> is a group of competitive Pokemon players that specializes in this, with varying degrees of success.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGO">Pokémon GO</a></em> has a more restricted battle system where Pokemon only get one fast move and two charged moves, but there still are some examples of Pokemon with wide movepools to confound the opponent. Apart from the aforementioned Mew, Hypno is a good example. Normally, removing the opponent's two shields (that block charge moves at the user's discretion) involves tricky mind games, which Hypno does well with access to the elemental punches that gives it unusually wide theoretical coverage. Not shielding against Hypno runs the risk of eating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-hit KO</a> or a huge chunk of damage if it so happens to have the appropriate move.
</li></ul></li><li> Jack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerStone">Power Stone</a></em>. He walks on all fours with knifes in his hands and feet and has surprisingly long reach despite his main weapon being daggers. His Power Stone form has the longest non-projectile reach and has giant chainsaw hands with unique combos.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oireland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oireland">Aran Ryan</a>, Wii version. He has no "idle animation" like the other opponents and never holds still, and slides all about the ring throwing in random punches. Also unlike every other fighter it's impossible to land a combo on him unless you counter him mid-attack. He's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">foul stinking cheat</a> and incorporates headbutts, elbow strikes, horseshoes in his gloves and perhaps most blatantly of all a <em>boxing glove on a rope</em> that he swings around like a flail, into his attacks. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">he's fucking crazy</a>. We mentioned the crazy, right?
<ul><li> Every Minor (except Disco Kid) and Major Circuit fighter in Title Defense has some sort of feint, delayed attack, or other unpredictable movement, which is the main source of the mode's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> reputation.
<ul><li> Even Disco Kid to some degree, as his left jab can be delayed or not, though he's not as bad as everyone else.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Donkey Kong</span> beats even Don Flamenco in the taunt-and-counter department, with multiple taunts, each with their own counter-attacks, and a lot of his attacks have similar build-ups. And sometimes he'll just accidentally hit himself in the face and give you a free star.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> has a small version of this; the Vyrewatch are a specific enemy that are normally undefeatable; it's said that they are able to read your mind so that they can predict your moves. Thus, you have to use an unpredictable weapon to land a strike on them. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail">Ivandis flail</a> is a weapon which can only be controlled in a general sense - "swing it at that guy". Even the wielder can't tell where the blow will land, or from what angle, so the predictive telepathy is worse than useless.
<ul><li> Oddly, the more Vyrewatch you kill with the flail, the more skilled you become with it... but counterintuitively, this <em>improves</em> the flail's efficacy, rather than allowing you (and thus the telepathic Vyrewatch) to predict its movement better. A true straight playing of Confusion Fu would have the flail become slowly less effective as its wielder gained experience with it — green recruits would be the best Vyre slayers, predictable veterans would be dead meat.
<ul><li> It's entirely possible that the user's body gets more accustomed to using the flail properly, but the user's thoughts amount to little more than "swing stick, kill Vyrewatch". Being able to read a mind is pointless if the body is acting on successful previous experiences without thought.
</li></ul></li><li> A later quest introduced Blisterwood, grown from a special tree deliberately created to exploit the vampyres' weaknesses- weapons made from the wood shift constantly and randomly, out of the wielder's control. Since the wielder never knows exactly what weapon they're going to be working with for the next five seconds, the vampyre they're killing won't either.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Series</a></em>
<ul><li> Voldo. Very few characters in the series can keep up a volley of attacks at an opponent while <em>facing the opposite direction</em>. Or while prone. And then there's his variety of interesting grab attacks, the most acrobatic of which is occasionally known by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WheresWally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WheresWally">Where's Voldo</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Now</a>?"
</li><li> Ditto with Yoshimitsu. Yoshimitsu's repertoire includes propeller-based flight, teleportation, healing himself from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusPosition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusPosition">Lotus Position</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">Seppuku</a>, spinning until dizzy, using his swords as stilts or pogo sticks, and a health-draining face grab, to name a few. Sometimes several of the above occur at once, and the health-drain also unlocks limited usage of a small move pool consisting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">an attack borrowed from each Tekken character</a>.
</li><li> Also applies to Maxi: he has seven different stances and different moves from them, making him difficult to read.
</li><li> Nearly half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeChineseGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeChineseGirl">Xianghua's</a> style revolves around the use of feints, counter stances, and evasive maneuvers to either avoid attack, or position herself to attack. Her counter stances are purposely designed to make her appear open to attack and are usually accompanied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalTaunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalTaunt">by a taunt</a> to bait the opponent, but they're recognized by the brief purple glow of her sword. If they fall for it, she'll auto-impact their attack and immediately follow up with an auto-counter (where she'll say: "Gotcha!"). And she can take it a step further, since many of her attacks can be delayed, or cancelled (which is indicated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">"Just kidding!"</a>) to throw off their timing.
</li><li> While all of the aforementioned characters are using unconventional stances to make their movements hard to read, nobody epitomizes this trope in Soul Calibur more than Lord Geo "Le Bello" Dampierre, a con artist with a pair of punching daggers appearing in <em>Broken Destiny</em> and <em>V</em>. Dampierre's damage output is pitiful compared to most characters, his range is practically nil, and he tends to take a lot of damage from attacks. What Dampierre has going for him, however, is how utterly <em>bizarre</em> his attacks are. A number of his moves involve him hurting himself and falling over, but Dampierre is one of the only characters who's at his most dangerous sprawling on the ground; characters unfamiliar with his fighting style are likely to eat several dangerous low-line attacks or Dampierre's extremely long and surprisingly damaging attack throw. While virtually all of Dampierre's moves look utterly ridiculous, he can prove himself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> <em>very</em> quickly if someone just pays attention to him moonwalking, stubbing his toe during a kick, or Russian dancing to air-juggle rather than the damage or ring-outs this can cause.
</li><li> Charade from <em>II</em> mimics a random fighter every round. So does Inferno (plus a few exclusive moves,) only with all the flames covering it it can make it harder for his opponent to see who he's mimicking.
</li><li> You'd be surprised for a character with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> to be this but thanks to his varied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">Stance System</a>, Siegfried Schtauffen can effectively blitz an opponent with a wide variety of attacks by rapidly switching between his 4 different stances and mixing up the attacks deployed from them that keep the foe constantly guessing and error-prone.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em>, where the player race can swim through their own color of ink including up walls and through grates, is full of this. Besides the obvious:
<ul><li> Swimming over obstacles instead of around them can be a simple way to catch an enemy unawares. Some abilities, like Swim Speed Up and Ninja Squid, allow you to use swimming more effectively in combat.
</li><li> The Inkbrush has fairly pathetic range and damage, but makes up for it by having some of the best mobility options in the game. Thanks to its versatile sub and special, it can also switch between long- and short-range on a whim, output bursts of damage that can splat an opponent thrice-over, jump in and out of combat as the user pleases, clear the objective with two bombs and a Splashdown, and take on almost any weapon in the game with a little creativity.
</li><li> Brellas are able to attack for chip damage (which is still fairly high in this game), defend and support teammates, making them invaluable for Ranked battles. Their subs and specials are often more support-focused, allowing them to hinder the enemy or make a strong push in some gamemodes.
</li><li> The Bamboozler is a charger, which are usually sniping weapons, but it only deals 80 damage on a fully charged shot, making it unable to OHKO. On the other hand, it has the fastest charge rate of any charger, and is the only charger with a constant range for charged and tap-shots. This makes it act more like a revolver than a sniper, since a single charged shot and a tap-shot is enough to score a kill. Its sub is a sliding bomb which bounces around before exploding, but hitting an enemy with the bomb itself deals exactly enough damage that following with a charged shot is a sure kill.
</li><li> This is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle">Signature Style</a> of Foil, a manufacturer introduced in <em>Splatoon 2</em>. Except for the Bubble Blower, each of their weapons has two forms that the user can switch between at will, and using one form when the opponents expect the other is key to using them well. Both the Squeezer and the Flingza Roller have a fast, short-range form and a slow, long-range form, which can set opponents up for misdirection as long as you don't make it obvious. Foil also makes the Baller, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Special Weapon</a> that's ordinarily a rolling ball that deals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage">Collision Damage</a>...until it explodes and inflicts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-hit knockout</a> on any opponents caught in the blast radius.
</li><li> While it's not manufactured by Foil, the Ballpoint Splatling is functionally very similar to their style. Splatlings can only shoot via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargeAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargeAttack">Charge Attacks</a>, but unique to the Ballpoint is that its range, damage, and fire rate change depending on how charged it is. Contrary to what logic may suggest, a full charge with a Ballpoint Splatling will actually result in a <em>shorter</em> range than a light charge, but as the charge unwinds, it will switch from one set of attributes to whatever is the next lighter one until it runs out.
</li><li> Bloblobbers shoot out four bouncy projectiles each time you press the trigger button. These projectiles can bounce off walls, and if you change your angle as they emerge from the weapon, they'll travel at different angles too. As a result, it's very hard to fight someone using a Bloblobber if there are a lot of walls close by.
</li><li> The Goo Tuber and the Nautilus are weapons that must be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargeAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargeAttack">charged</a> to attack, but they can hold their charges for a long time while you're hiding or traveling in ink (in which you're practically invisible). They're not particularly fast or powerful, but they do allow for devastating ambushes. That is, from the perspective of an opponent, a skilled Goo Tuber or Nautilus user could potentially be hiding anywhere.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>
<ul><li> Dhalsim is quite possibly the first fighting game character to use this style, as his various angled jump attacks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">stretchy limbs</a> and different teleportation moves make him great at screwing with the opponent's head.
</li><li> Gen from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterI">Street Fighter I</a></em> onward has two different fighting styles that he switch on the fly, even when getting attacked, jumping, attacking, etc.. The fighting styles not only change his attacks, but also change his jump and walk physics, give him multiple supers (four at a time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em>), and change his standing and crouching hurtboxes. If a Gen player uses him just right (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">much, much easier said than done</a>), the opponent will never be able to predict his next move.
</li><li> In later versions, we're given Crimson Viper, El Fuerte and Abel, all introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em>, and each one whose primary gameplay revolves entirely around scoring a single knockdown and keeping your opponent in an endless guessing game.
</li><li> Don't be fooled by the grappler get-up and moveset, because R.Mika in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em> possesses some of the craziest mix-up potential in the game. That's saying something considering that two of the game's characters<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29shd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note29shd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29shd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Nash and Bison, the latter has this <em>as a super mode</em></span> can freaking teleport. How is this possible you ask? Simple, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter">Assist Character</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3esls');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3esls" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3esls');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Yamato Nadeshiko, Mika's tag team partner</span>, when summoned, will come crashing on you with no input as to <em>where</em> the attack will come from. Guess wrong, and kiss 20-50% of your health goodbye. Guess right, and the insane blockstun will guarantee that Mika gets to perform either a mix-up, or a command grab, or just about <em>anything</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>
<ul><li> Mr. Game &amp; Watch and Wario, thanks to their low-frame animations. Also, Game &amp; Watch has genuine unpredictability in his Judgment attack.
</li><li> Luigi, starting in <em>Melee</em>, is a mild case of this. Although he looks like Mario, his moves function notably differently, throwing many people off. Several of his moves are designed to come from nowhere, his Green Missile can randomly launch him at killer speeds, and several of his moves (most notably his forward+A on the ground) are designed to be longer than they look. His floaty nature and low traction make him hard to combo. Finally, his Final Smash move in <em>Brawl</em> is just plain weird, inflicting random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">status ailments</a> on enemies (and inflicting sitar music on all the players).
</li><li> Sonic is another mild case; the unpredictability comes from the sheer number of his moves that start with very similar spinning animations but do wildly different things and the fact that he can still attack after his recovery move. In particular, the <em>Smash Bros.</em> Wiki has severe trouble in gauging Sonic's Tier level, since, while the character doesn't perform universally well in tournaments (unlike high tier characters, such as Meta Knight) Sonic performs so radically different depending on who is playing him that any kind of tier level is theoretical at best. It also helps that, under certain circumstances, he can instantly shield out of some of his spins (during side-B's charge if it's not fully wound up, and during a down-B spindash if you're in the air and land).
</li><li> Some of the characters, while otherwise predictable, have one or two moves that can mess with people's heads. Mario's cape attack flips the directions his enemies are facing, which can confuse new players that don't know why they suddenly are attacking backwards. In <em>Brawl</em>, King Dedede's projectile normally is just a Waddle Dee, but has a small chance being a Waddle Doo, a Gordo, or an item; in <em>3DS and Wii U,</em> it's always a Gordo, but can be bounce along several different paths.
</li><li> Similarly, Peach usually uproots turnips from the ground, but every so often she'll get a Bob-omb.
</li><li> One of the reasons Meta Knight is considered the best character in <em>Brawl</em> is that almost all of his special attacks can be used as recovery moves (on top of his five jumps) so it's almost impossible to predict how he will get back on the stage.
</li><li> Zelda can teleport to where she is already standing.
</li><li> Olimar uses Pikmin in all of his attacks. Each color of Pikmin has different properties, and when Olimar creates them, they spawn randomly (in <em>Brawl</em>, in <em>3DS and Wii U,</em> it's a set order). When Olimar performs an attack, the line cycles, so his next attack will use the next Pikmin in line. This means that different strategies open up depending on what order your Pikmin are in. Fun times for both players.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> Heroes look like down-to-earth sword and board types on the surface, but then you get to their random critical hits and their down special that pulls up a random list of 4 spells out of a pool of 20, which has stuff like turning into an immobile but near-invincible metal statue, <em>two</em> instant death moves, a <em>self-destruct button</em>, and a spell with completely random effects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentofRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentofRedundancyDepartment">Yes, there's a random effect spell in this random list of spells.</a>
</li><li> Dash-dancing in <em>Melee</em> largely attempts to achieve this effect.
</li><li> The playstyle of <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> player Joseph "Mango" Marquez could be described as this, as he is known for his unorthodox mixup game and flashy punishes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Spy can pretend to be other classes, of both his team and of his enemies, forcing the enemy team to waste ammo on anybody and being paranoid about everybody. They can also use alternate cloaking items to drop fake body when hit, making it hard to tell if you killed the Spy or he is invisible and about to backstab you.
<ul><li> On servers with friendly fire enabled, it is ironically easier to check for spies since your teammates will flinch and cry out if they are real when you hit them and will react like a teammate on a non-friendly fire server if they are a disguised enemy spy. Of course, they will also take the full brunt of the damage you apply, so it's best not to check for spies with a high-crit-chance melee weapon, though the flamthrower will still not harm your teammates.
</li><li> On the flip side, playing as a Spy can be made more difficult if your opponents operate this way. Randomly turning around, walking in irregular patterns, and suddenly backing up can cause many a Spy to miss his backstab, especially if he's new to the game. Spies operate heavily on knowing where their enemies would <em>normally</em> be, so if you're somewhere unexpected (down a back corridor, pressed against the wall where a Spy would normally walk, etc.) this can also throw Spies off, and you might even accidentally run into some invisible ones.
</li></ul></li><li> The Scout can double jump. This doesn't sound impressive, but a good Scout is a nightmare to deal with, being able to change direction while in the air and be impossible to hit, or SEE. And because of his high speed, you can never be sure whether a Scout is genuinely running away or circling around to ambush you again.
<ul><li> The Soda Popper can give the scout <em>five</em> midair jumps taking this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> An increasingly common tactic with the Engineer is to put his mini-sentries in random places that make no sense outside of how unexpected they are, and then put up a new one in a different location as soon as the old one is destroyed.
</li><li> The randomizer mod gives <em>everyone</em> this. Scouts with sniper rifles? Spies with miniguns? Backstabbing Soldiers? Heavies with flamethrowers? Rocket launcher Pyros? It's all possible, and you have no way to know what weapon your foe is carrying until he fires.
</li><li> Due to the way this game handles lag, someone with a bad connection can be a nightmare to fight, what with their movements resembling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">Teleport Spam</a> and their attacks fading in and out of existence without much of a pattern. Pyros are known for teleporting onto unwitting faces with the flamethrower blazing, Heavy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">boolets</a> occasionally curve around corners, Spies might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstab">backstab</a> you in the face, or you might get struck down by a projectile that decided to appear out of thin air right in front of you, and neither you nor your opponent know when any of these might happen. In particular, laggy players are essentially impossible to properly deal with for spies and snipers, as both rely on a single moment of high precision, which is impossible to achieve when someone's connection is hiccuping: Chances are the foe'll just teleport right when you press the button, either wasting a bullet or leaving the poor spy stranded in the middle of enemy lines without a disguise.
</li><li> In Medieval Mode, where every weapon is disabled except for melee weapons (and a few others), engaging an enemy becomes a dance, as combatants will alternate between closing in and spacing themselves out until someone decides to swing.
</li><li> Pyros are this for several reasons, having a diverse variety of melee weapons that have wildly differing special abilities as well as arguably the largest number of mobility options in the game. Two of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">their</a> melee weapons increase speed as an effect, two increase health in certain circumstances, two of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlareGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlareGun">Flare Guns</a> allow them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump">Rocket Jump</a>, and now they have an honest to goodness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpJetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpJetPack">Jump Jet Pack</a> that lets them freely rocket around at high speed. As a result, Pyros thrive on unpredictability almost as much as Spies and Scouts do.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em>:
<ul><li> Eddie Gordo (and his student Christie Montiero), with his weird capoeira ground-fighting moves, is sometimes impossible to predict unless you know his character inside and out. Not only that, most of the moves those characters use cannot be reversed. A random button masher using these characters is actually much harder to beat then someone who actually trying to do moves they plan on, until they truly master the character.
</li><li> Lei Wulong has several different stances, plus a variety of moves that can be used from the ground or while facing the other direction.
</li><li> Ling Xiaoyu also has two stances, some effective combos that hit someone behind her, and the ability to roll or cartwheel off to the side of her opponent.
</li><li> Dr. Boskonovich from <em>Tekken 3</em> has an unfortunate tendency to fall over for no apparent reason but capitalizes on it with several ground combos. In <em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</em> Dr. B's moves are vaguely similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Dampierre</a> in that half of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheFuAreYouDoing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheFuAreYouDoing">goofy moves</a> cause him to reel in pain, which puts him in a good position to mixup his opponents. He also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">explodes a lot</a>, either for juggles, mobility, or making his moves safe.
</li><li> Mokujin. At the beginning of each round, he randomly chooses the moveset of a random character to fight with.
</li><li> Zafina from <em>6</em>. Her attacks are similar to Voldo from the <em>Soul</em> series in that her movement is highly unpredictable, full of extreme body contortions and sneaky attacks. Hitting her can also be challenging as she can get her body very low to the ground. Unfortunately, that hasn't saved her from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers">low tier</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TorchlightII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TorchlightII">Torchlight II</a></em> has a skill for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Embermage</a> that lets his attacks with a wand have a chance to cause a random effect, including acid rain, shadow bats exploding and a meteor out of nowhere. It gets better, though: The ability also applies to certain skills, including Shockbolts, which both emits several curving projectiles and has them hit enemies several times before dissipating, and every single hit has a chance to trigger an effect. High levels in both can make both your enemies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">your computer</a> fall to your knees.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> character Marisa Kirisame does this in the fighting game spin-offs of the series, <em>Immaterial and Missing Power</em> and <em>Scarlet Weather Rhapsody</em>, with quick and annoying attacks that mess with combos, including the dreaded "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssKicksYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssKicksYou">Butt Attack</a>".
<ul><li> <em>Hisoutensoku</em> added Suwako, who takes this trait and amps it to 11. Her default standing position is ducking, ducking makes her <em>taller</em> by summoning a lily pad underneath her, she air dashes by flapping her arms, she <em>swims</em> through the ground in both her ground dash and several of her moves, and many of her attacks involve summoning trees in various places. She does not even walk. <strong>She hops.</strong>
</li><li> Both <em>Scarlet Weather Rhapsody</em> and <em>Hisoutensoku</em> involve some random factor because of the weather and deck system: The weather will mess with you depending on which one that comes up, while the deck system allows you to either change your moveset on the fly or use super moves at the cost of cards.
</li><li> We might as well add Hong Meiling's final opponent. You've been fighting against typical opponents, all the while the background gradually becomes more simple in style. Then a giant catfish shows up. You already know the entire battle will be random.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">Reisen Udongein Inaba</a> has shades of this in both shooters and fighting games. In shooters, she uses bullets that can shift, turn, multiply, stop and/or become invisible mid-flight. In fighting games, her moveset is similarly built around deceptive attacks, like a missile whose explosion appears ahead of the missile itself, two physical attacks that look the exact same on startup, or attacks that use illusionary copies that may or may not be able to attack on their own. The kicker? Many of her illusion copy attacks involve movement with the copy being created mid attack or just after making you wonder if she followed through or if the follow through is a decoy...the difference between the 'heavy' and 'light' versions of the attack are which image is the decoy so have fun guessing.
</li><li> And the fighting game <em>Hopeless Masquerade</em> added the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedCharacter">Unexpected Character</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Koishi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerceptionFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerceptionFilter">Komeiji</a>. What wasn't unexpected was that she would use confusion-fu. What <em>was</em> unexpected was how random and confusing it would turn out to be. Well enough for the fact that her normal attacks include things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SneezeOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SneezeOfDoom">sneezing</a> (which fails by having Koishi catch her nose if attempted twice in quick succession) or having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdeaBulb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdeaBulb">Idea Bulb</a>, her forward dash has her turn intangible while prancing onwards and, after a few steps, <em>skips</em>... which is actually an attack, by the way... The top of the mousse is that one of her attack buttons doesn't do anything. <em>Until slightly later on in the fight, provided certan conditions are met.</em> At first she's likely to be just as unpredictable to the one using her as she is to the opponent.

Rocket boots may yield a short but powerful burst of speed, or they may explode and hit everyone nearby.

On top of that, she has a veritable cornuciopia of random items she can summon from the sky to fall on her foe, from flower pots to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PianoDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PianoDrop">pianos</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JojosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JojosBizarreAdventure">steamrollers</a> and more.

</li><li> You're practically forced to fight this way in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>; sword-wielding enemies are very good at blocking deliberate sword strikes from any direction. To hit them, you must either fool them into thinking you're swinging in one direction and then actually swing in a different direction (which is pretty tricky), or swing randomly like a maniac until you hit them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em>, one of the best ways to use the nimblest light tanks, especially the T-50-2, is being as "random" as possible in maneuvering once shots start firing. Hitting them becomes incredibly difficult, and they're known for their ability to sneak past large columns of tanks to strike at the weak artillery in the rear.
<ul><li> Also used by Camouflage-centric Tank destroyers. Basically their tactics connsist of picking the most inane spot possible, holing up in there and waiting for someone to pass by so they can blow him/her wide open with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">High caliber gun</a>.
<ul><li> This includes abusing the physics engine to hang over a cliff and shoot things under it, blowing up a building to use it as cover, and even just sitting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight">somewhere out in the open</a> if they have a high enough camo rating.
</li></ul></li><li> The VK 30.01 (H) is notorious for having an extremely diverse selection of guns, most of which look quite similar at the first or second glance from 300 meters off. You never know what you'll find when you end up facing this particular tank—will it stay at long range punching holes in your armor with its monstrous Waffe 0725 gun? Will it suddenly lurch around the corner and vaporize half your hit points with a 10.5 cm howitzer? Or have you encountered a crazy person who equipped the fast-firing 5cm cannon and plans to keep you constantly immobilized while his artillery friends finish you off? The only way to know is to watch it fire and hope you can recognize gun sounds and shell behaviors.

Almost all of her attacks have random effects, some of which can actually end up damaging herself or the entire party. The things used for said attacks are just random, including a mini rocket ship she can ride out of the battlefield, presents with harmful "gifts" in them, a frying pan, and mahjong pieces.

These and some of her other abilities make her very difficult to predict both in terms of gameplay and outside it, where she manages to score a victory over Lily and then Taiga without either having any idea what she just did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarlordsBattlecry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarlordsBattlecry">Warlords Battlecry</a> III</em>: the Empire can hire "Foreign Mercenaries", which basically amounts to a random unit from another faction (basic, stronger or a general, so this covers nearly every single unit in the game) for a slightly expensive price which can be cut in half with some upgrades, making it quite cheap. It can be done as much as you like, making it perfectly possible to amass an army whose units are unknown to you and your enemy until the dice are cast, which can be a good strategy sometimes, a bad one some other times, but it's <em>always</em> fun.
</li><li> Mesmers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> are considered one of the strongest classes in PvP due to their MO being screwing with your head. A properly built Mesmer can go in and out of stealth while dropping flawless clones of themselves nearly every second, guaranteeing that if you lose sight of them for even a second, odds are you won't find the real one until the clones all bum rush you for a devastating suicide bomb, followed before even <em>more</em> clones. It also doesn't help that all of their "shatter" skills do different thing, it could be damage, a stun, make the mesmer dodge all attacks, or inflict confusion (which makes the target hit themselves), Shatter's four explosions have absolutely <em>no</em> visual variance in which one it's going to be.
<ul><li> Engineers have a variant of this in that they can change their playstyle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">wildly</a> through their kit abilities. They can go from a rifle-wielding sniper to a close-range juggernaut with a flamethrower to a back-line support character with only a couple of skill uses. Figuring what kind of Engineer you're up against is pretty much impossible to tell until you're locked in combat. And if they're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">Holosmith</a>, it only gets worse as now they have another massive damage kit they can turn on at will that doesn't take up a skill bar slot.

The ability, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">with practice</a>, can easily block multiple enemies from attacking anyone smart enough to keep away from their targets that are affected by said decoy.

When you fight her openly, she will stop at random times for no reason (or sometimes, to scream or laugh), sometimes she'll suddenly break out into a run, whack the floor near Fiona - making her flinch and therefore leave herself open to further attack - or start walking with robotic movements that can only be intended to weird the player out and distract them. Or, as a worst case scenario, she'll knock Fiona down, get on top of her and slit her throat. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>. No matter what, the average player will soon learn that the best strategy when facing her is to put a great distance between her and Fiona, and <em>keep it that way</em>.

<ul><li> Mayu Shiina has this as her fighting style, as she uses her animal-like moves to fight, and incorporates a lot of acrobatics in her moves and jump and seemingly random directions, to finally dive kick her opponent, or grab her and pound her into the ground.
</li><li> Nayuki Minase counts to a lesser extent, as she fights mostly in a sleepy state, and can increase her offense and mobility as she consumes strawberry jam.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgentsOfMayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgentsOfMayhem">Agents of Mayhem</a></em>: The agents were specifically hired, despite all rational logic suggesting this is a horrible idea, because of their unpredictability. Gameplay-wise, you can switch characters with teleportation and change tactics in less than a quarter of a second, allowing you to combine the strengths of all characters in a single moment or just go crazy with random choices, preventing the enemy units from developing a cohesive strategy against all six interchangeable specialists.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Absolver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Absolver">Absolver</a></em> has this in the "Stagger" style, which is based heavily on real-world Drunken Boxing. The moves are unpredictable and strange to look at, and similarly are much harder to dodge or parry than the other, more normal jabs or spin kicks. Using the stance itself allows you to dodge attacks by stumbling out of the way, or even by falling into them to interrupt their combos!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokerNightAtTheInventory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokerNightAtTheInventory">Poker Night at the Inventory</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">a pretty good poker AI</a> for three of its opponents, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMax">Max</a> is the exception: he doesn't know the rules to poker, and he occasionally suggests that he doesn't even look at the cards in his hand.

But since this is a poker game, this is actually works for Max; it makes him a very difficult read since nobody has any idea what the hell he's doing, especially given his comparatively subtle tells when he focuses and <em>does</em> start playing the game correctly.

<div class="indent"> Misdirection is the key to survival. Never attack what your enemy defends, never behave as your enemy expects, and never reveal your true strengths. If knowledge is power, then to be unknown is to be unconquerable.

All these are very much key to duels, because if a competent enemy knows exactly what you're doing while they can still parry you simply won't get to harm them. Even the slowest of weapons can be made deadly with a little unpredictability (and are known for tripping up a lot of people that parry too early).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForHonor">For Honor</a></em>:

Furthermore, some combos can be continued by various moves which you cannot predict at all, an if you are wrong in this case, you will be punished with some amount of guarateed damage. It is almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> issue if the opponent does not spam one variant mindlessly.
</li><li> Sometimes you can easily hit an expeirenced player by spamming light attacks without even changing the stance. This works only because of how unbelievably stupid it is, and it is possible to miss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">up to ten</a> hits, delievered in such a style.

He prefers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wielding</a> <em>swords</em> in melee combat, rather than using the bow every other Servant expects him to rely on. His dress, weapons, and abilities do not match those of any known mythological hero, his personality is decisively non-heroic, and he has a magus-level knowledge of magical phenomenon, making it impossible to identify him. On top of this, he is shown to use multiple Noble Phantasms belonging to very different myths, in some cases even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">sundering the Phantasms as part of his attacks</a>, normally a near-unthinkable, one-time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> attack — and no explanation as to where he acquired his Phantasms is forthcoming. Archer's preferred fighting style itself is also refined to inflict as much confusion as possible. He deliberately leaves openings in his guard so that he can control and counter where his opponents will strike, which has the added effect of making it difficult to tell if a slip up is exactly that or just a ploy. The swords that he wields he will <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionGuidedBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionGuidedBoomerang">throw like boomerangs</a></em> at random trajectories, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpontaneousWeaponCreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpontaneousWeaponCreation">pull new ones out of thin air</a>. Just about all Servants have a trick or two up their sleeve, but Archer is the only one who games his every opponent from the get go.

She jumps between panels of the comic strip, breaks off a piece of the gutter to throw at an enemy (which then pins them in place, because <em>the gutter doesn't move</em>), tosses her opponents across panels, and uses the perspective of the comic to hit enemies out of her reach — the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> equivalent of "I squish your head". It's enough to utterly baffle her Abyssal opponents, with whom she mops the floor quite handily. It doesn't hurt that, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, Sidereals can make themselves impossible to predict by most people.

It's implied this is a bit of a double-edged sword, as getting a low roll against a sufficiently powerful opponent would leave the attacker defenseless. However when she rolls the highest possible number, all 8's,(which, incidentally, has a probability of 1/8^8 of being rolled, or 1/16,777,216) she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> channels the fighting soul of her ancestor and is able to go toe to toe with an omnipotent super being</span>. Becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> once she ascends to the God Tiers, as her role as the Thief of Light means that she is guaranteed good rolls when she needs them.
</li><li> The Pop-A-Matic Vrillyhoo Hammer, which combines the Fluorite Octet with the Warhammer of Zillyhoo, does this, but on a smaller scale. Whenever you successfully bonk someone on the head with it, a list of 8 appears, and one status from that 8 is triggered.

</li><li> The episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> called "Harmonic Convergence" shows Bumi ravaging a whole Northern Water Tribe camp with his usual goofy antics.

</li><li> The episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> where Cartman thinks he died plays with this, in that Cartman actually intended to use his ghostly spookiness as the tactic. However, being that Cartman was entirely visible, what the criminals saw definitely qualifies as this trope, and were simply too weirded out to react.

In a later episode, just like the Comic Books example above, Taskmaster has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment when he hears Spider Man brought along Deadpool to capture him.

The scene is too short to tell whether it's working or not, though the bugbear does give her a stare.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a> was in fact a huge advocate of this trope:
<div class="indent">Become unpredictable, strike from your subconscious mind, let your moves flow out from your individual essence. Even the most masterful opponent will fall from a strike that has no history or reference, the moves created from your own individual unique essence may surprise even you.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtOfWarSunTzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtOfWarSunTzu">Sun Tzu</a> was a proponent of this, though he referred to "orthodox strategies" and "unorthodox strategies"; in fact, he said that implementing orthodox strategies at unexpected times was an unorthodox strategy in and of itself.
<div class="indent">Thus the pinnacle of military deployment approaches the formless. If it is formless, then even the deepest spy cannot discern it or the wise make plans against it.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenBoxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenBoxing">Drunken Boxing</a> runs on this — it's meant to be hard to predict, using flowing movements that emulate a drunken stagger.
</li><li> This is a standard tool in military tactics, particularly for convoys. Rather than have one secure route, it is far better to have several slightly-less-secure routes and choose between them at random. That way, even if one route is compromised, the odds are against it being the one that you are using. Convoys escorting high-profile people, such as the President of the United States, use a similar strategy with their vehicles as well as their routes — have several identical vehicles and move them around at random.
</li><li> According to Otto fon Bismark, this is the usual Russian style. They counter every stratagem by unpredictable folly:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a> where they broke a lot of rules of European "gentleman warfare" by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">Hit-and-Run Tactics</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScorchedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScorchedEarth">Scorched Earth</a>, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> with leaving Moscow.

</li><li> Also in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the Soviet Air Force did this with their formations of fighters in that they would fly in a disorganized mob moving in the general direction of where they were going.
