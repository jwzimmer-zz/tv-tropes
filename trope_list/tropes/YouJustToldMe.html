The police sergeant says it might help that the crook is allergic to eggs; Anzu says (falsely) that he will be easy to catch, because the burger buns have lots of egg in them. At that, the crook freaks out and tries to bolt, despite having suffered no ill effects when he ate there the day before. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> in that the allergic crook is the one the police are searching for, but he isn't the actual culprit behind the crimes they think were his.

In the original series, when watching Kira fight, Andy quickly deduces that the Strike Gundam's pilot is a Coordinator. He later figures out that Kira is the pilot, most likely by watching his actions during a Blue Cosmos terrorist attack both are caught in. Realizing Kira is a both a Coordinator and not a native, and puts two and two together. He then confronts Kira in a scene which is played like he flat out <em>knows</em> what he is saying is true. In the novel, he suspects it (bases on his observations), but isn't quite sure, and uses one of these to confirm it.

Minako and Chibiusa go to the pharmacy to pick up medicine for the Tsukinos, and coincidentally encounter Esmeraude, who seizes the opportunity to try and kidnap Chibiusa while she's at it. Minako/Sailor Venus comes to the rescue, prompting the following exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong>Esmeraude:</strong> I see! You somehow used your power to locate our Dark Henge site. <br/><strong>Sailor Venus:</strong> Sure did! <br/><strong>Esmeraude:</strong> Damn! So, to be clear, you're saying you knew about our plan to make the entire city sick by spreading medicine laced with dark power from this hospital base? <br/><strong>Sailor Venus:</strong> Yeah! It was so obvious! <br/><strong>Chibiusa:</strong> Wow, Venus will say anything based on the situation.

Later on he sneezes and when Astérix absent-mindedly says "Bless you" he thanks him, <em>in Gaul</em>. Made funnier by his subsequent frantic insistence that he does not speak Gaul - still in Gaul.

Near the end of the episode, the investigator confronts McManus and explains a crucial fact McManus had left out before of his prior account, and which can lead to revealing the identity of the person who killed Ross, a person whom McManus had been trying to cover for. After a long period of silence, McManus grudgingly asks "Who told you that?" Three guesses what the response is.

</div></li><li> In another episode, when preparing to give the Aschen some Stargate codes, Samantha Carter then asks one of the Aschen what a particular word means. The Aschen, not realizing the repercussions of what would happen, simply answered "sterility," in essence admitting that the drug they were giving the Tau'ri would actually give them sterility, making quite clear of the Aschen's ill-intentions towards Earth.

He drops several clues to Quark that he <em>does</em> know, such as "Oh, I think you KNOW why I'm arresting you," trying to invoke this trope. It works, but not in time to prevent the Orion Syndicate from trying to blow up their ship, leaving them stranded on an uninhabitable planet. It turns out Quark wasn't even being charged with a crime, but rather subpoenaed as a reluctant/unwilling witness against the Syndicate, which is why they're after him. Quark and Odo are both incensed at <em>each other</em> when they discover the bomb which was planted on the shuttlecraft. Quark is mad at Odo for trying to invoke this trope on him, while Odo defensively lashes out that if Quark had just spilled the beans they'd have had <em>a lot</em> more security in place for their trip.

<ul><li> A shibboleth is a word, sound, or custom that a person unfamiliar with its significance may not pronounce or perform correctly relative to those who are familiar with it. It is used to identify foreigners or those who do not belong to a particular class or group of people. It also refers to features of language, and particularly to a word or phrase whose pronunciation identifies a speaker as belonging to a particular group.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> gives us <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shibboleths">a list<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The word's origins are in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em> (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=judges%2012:5-6&amp;version=NIV">Judges 12:5-6<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), where the word was used as a test to reveal whether someone had a regional accent. The Ephriamites would pronounce it as "sibboleth," thus giving away the fact that they were enemy agents. That makes this one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>.
</li><li> Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo conducted a brutal massacre of undocumented Haitian settlers along the Dominican-Haitian border. The action is known as the Parsley Massacre. Suspects not fluent in Spanish either did not know or could not properly pronounce the Spanish word 'perejil' (parsley). The pronunciation of the word by Haitian citizens tended to be with a non-rotative r and an omission of the 'l' at the end of the word.
</li></ul></li><li> Shouting "Attention!" is one method of revealing if someone has military training (an FBI agent did this while interrogating a suspect in the 1998 Nairobi bombing). Shouting "Achtung!" unexpectedly was used among Allied prisoners of war to uncover German infiltrators.
</li><li> To tell if someone speaks a language or not, police often ask them to say what color different words are (like the word "<span>red</span>" written in green ink). People who speak the language will <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect">take far longer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This is because this is the Stroop Test, a psychology tool in which taking longer is <em>normal</em>, under normal conditions.
</li><li> A Russian proverbial story tells about a guy who spots a pickpocket in the market. Nobody else sees it, though, so the quick-witted fellow points in the thief's general direction and shouts: "That <em>thief's</em> hat is on fire!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">The crook instinctively grabs his headgear...</a>
</li><li> Very similarly, in a Serbian folk tale, St. Sava (the man that established the Serbian Orthodox Church) was asked to use his wisdom to find a thief in a crowd. He replied with "Oh, that's easy. It's the guy with the bee on his hat!" pointing out into the crowd's general direction. Of course, the guy waves his hand to chase off the (nonexistent) bee, and gets caught.
</li><li> Pickpockets use this to find people's wallets.
<ul><li> A lateral thinking puzzle asks how police putting up signs warning about pickpockets actually helps the thieves. The solution is that pickpockets hang around the signs. When people see the notices, they automatically check their valuables to make sure they haven't been stolen, showing the thieves exactly where they keep them.
</li><li> One TV show about scams showed that thieves sometimes take advantage of this and put up the signs themselves!
</li><li> An old trick among pickpockets working in groups is to have one person turn to a friend and (loudly) proclaim "Somebody stole my wallet!" The marks nearby instantly will pat their own wallets, broadcasting the location of their valuables.
</li><li> Even more subtly. Most people will subconsciously check their wallet if bumped into in a crowded place. Pickpockets use this to learn which pocket their mark keeps it in before making their move.
</li></ul></li><li> Undercover police officers usually use their own first name to avoid this.
</li><li> To avoid this, while agents were in training they would be woken up by instructors in the middle of the night and asked things like "what is your mother's maiden name". The other point was so they would know their cover story so well it may as well have been their own life.
</li><li> A member of Allied intelligence in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a> thought agents were captured and impersonated, so at the end of one of the messages he sent H.H. (for Heil Hitler). The message he got back from the 'agents' also ended in H.H.
</li><li> A preteen/teenager joke in Brazil is saying "The hands of whoever just farted are yellow". Whoever looks...
</li><li> A similar joke in the United States is to say "Did you know frequent masturbation gives you hairy knuckles?" and then mock whoever takes a moment to check.
</li><li> This is why government authorities who are supposed to keep a secret are supposed to use the stock line "I can neither confirm nor deny that" when asked any question vaguely related to secret matters, even if it's not a secret they know or is completely off base. It stops the pattern of "no", "I can't answer that", and "I don't even know what you're talking about" from revealing information.
</li><li> Commonly used by parents to trick young children into outing themselves on lies. One variant has the parent use "magic powder", or some facsimile thereof, to supposedly make a child's ears turn colours whenever they lie. Not difficult to spot fibs when the child in question starts conspicuously covering their ears.
<ul><li> There's an old story with a non-verbal variation. A hotel's guest had valuables stolen by another guest at the hotel. They call in a wise man who hands out sticks, each of the same length, to the guests. He says that they're magic, and the stick given to the thief will grow a certain amount in the night. The guests handed their sticks to the man the next morning, and the thief was the one with the <em>shortest</em> stick, as he had trimmed it to disguise its growth.
</li><li> A story told about the mathematician John Napier says that he believed one of his servants was stealing from him, so he declared that they all had to enter a dark room and touch his rooster (not a euphemism) who would crow if it felt the touch of a dishonest man. Since people were rather fuzzy on the difference between scientist and sorcerer at the time, and it was widely rumoured the rooster was his familiar, this sounded plausible. Afterwards, he explained that the rooster was covered in coal dust, and the thief was the man with clean hands.
</li><li> Yet another variant involves a wise man setting up a box, backing a donkey against a hole cut in it, and telling the suspects to enter the box and pull on the donkey's tail. The donkey would only bray for the thief. Of course, the "tail" the people were pulling in the box wasn't actually the donkey's tail, but it was coated in oil, so the thief could be caught dirty-handed (or clean-handed, as the case may be).
