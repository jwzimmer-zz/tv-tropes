</p><p>Not necessarily. In fact, not even probably. Potentially dangerous insanity in the ruling line rarely appears in a single, isolated case when it comes to fiction. Nope. Chances are the whole family line is just as affected somehow, which means that sooner or later—probably sooner—along will come Queen Enid II and King Dolf III both or either of whom is painfully, obviously off their rocker enough for people to openly comment... And, the whole thing will start up all over again.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This may continue for a good many decades or even centuries, with each new generation crossing its fingers that they get one of the "good" rulers from the line and not one of the "iffy" bunch. If you are unfortunate enough to get stuck with one of the blood-drenched loonies, one common solution is to go find someone else from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">same family</a> who didn't get hit with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> stick and put <em>them</em> on the throne instead of poor Enid or Dolf before revolution breaks out. This is where disgraced half-brothers, exiled princes/princesses and unknown sons/daughters come into play. Unless something permanent is done about the family problem, however, this is most likely just a temporary solution. Give it a generation or three of this side-branch inheriting, and it'll be back to our regular Queen Enid "Tree-Whisperer (and Agricultural Reformer)" IV and King Dolf "<em>Bloody</em> Insane" VI programming.
</p><p>In fiction there are several common reasons why a royal family might be prone to madness.
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Genetics:</strong> It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a> in the completely literal, biological and strictly genetic sense. Often, that means excessive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalInbreeding">Royal Inbreeding</a>, sometimes <em>very</em> excessive. The initial problem maybe wasn't inbreeding, but some genetic damage caused by an outside source that then becomes intensified and cemented into the royal line after the fact either through deliberate inbreeding or the sheer bad luck of not understanding biology when selecting mates. In any case, the family just has a crazy streak that's now inbuilt, and you're not getting rid of it unless your society is advanced enough to have genetic engineering (or a magical equivalent thereof) to deal with the problem. Or, becomes egalitarian enough for the high nobility to stop marrying each other so much. That last bit ought to help. Eventually.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Moral Lamarckism</a> is the classical, magical version. The moral failings of your forebears express themselves in a taint on your own soul or karmic bank balance, like a kind of spiritual gene. Functionally, there isn't much difference.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">Family Curse</a>:</strong> Arguably, this is worse than a crappy genetic surprise. Someone, or something, has cursed the royal line... somehow and for whatever reason (most likely revenge). This can easily be a lot nastier to deal with than the problem of bad physical or moral genes, because even if you're careful about avoiding the inbreeding and taking care to select mates for brains, upstanding habits and/or governing skills, the curse really <em>doesn't</em> care. It may even spread out to people who marry into the royal line and cause them to go mad, even though they're only family by marriage, not by blood. It also means that you might not solve the problem by just picking a new family to rule over you—they're also likely to get swatted by the curse just as soon as they take power if the thing was either badly worded or specifically made to target those who rule a particular place, rather than just "the family of the one who wronged me". Obviously, to fix this you need to figure out who or what cursed the royal line with what words and why they did it, and then work out how to deal with the mess by whatever means necessary. You could try jumping straight to a parliamentary system to see how the curse deals with having hundreds of "rulers", but you'd better hope it just doesn't spread out to cover them all, or it will make your old problem seem <em>laughably</em> trivial by comparison.
<ul><li> One variant of this is a spiritual or moral imbalance brought on by upsetting the planetary or universal equilibrium or law in some way. This works just like a curse, but is the result of natural processes, rather than deliberate, magical malice. This lack of motive can make it harder to detect or uncover.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Cultural:</strong> The madness is the product of nurture, not nature; which means turning to exiled princes will be fine, at least for the first generation. If people don't change the culture that produced the madness, it will return, however. Possible reasons include:
<ul><li> The family has just become <em>too</em> used to being pampered and in power over generations, and each successive one has become a little more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">backstabby, corrupt, decadent and detached</a> from general, boring, common everyday reality until <em>finally</em> people start to notice the extent of what has become a huge problem.
</li><li> The culture actually <em>expects</em> its rulers to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeurodiversityIsSupernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeurodiversityIsSupernatural">"divinely touched"</a> and requires the king or high priest to be at least a little crazy, particularly in theocracies with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle">Mad Oracle</a> tradition or another culture with a particularly notable flavour of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings">Divine Right of Kings</a> idea behind them — say a line of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God Emperors</a> where rampant megalomania and other quirks are considered just part and parcel of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower">Royalty Superpower</a> package. Not being weird enough might even disqualify you, so you'd better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">learn to act the proper degree of nuts</a> at the very least. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Comes with risks attached</a>, however.
</li><li> The cut-throat culture itself is so hard on its rulers either politically or militarily that not being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">paranoid and vicious</a> means your reign will be measured in months... if you're lucky. In this case, you only look insane to cultures or classes outside your own; within your own palace and/or while on the inevitable battlefield, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">behaving as if everything is out to get you</a> is primarily a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToBeSharp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToBeSharp">survival strategy</a>, and <em>not</em> just a way to pass the resulting PTSD and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare">Thousand-Yard Stare</a> around.
</li><li> The very way the royal kids are raised becomes severely detrimental to their sanity. Bring them up to specifically become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShelteredAristocrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShelteredAristocrat">sheltered</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">entitled</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">morally myopic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">empathy-free</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brats</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Caligulas</a> are almost <em>inevitably</em> what you'll get once they get tapped on the shoulder by their inheritance. Unless they just become reclusive shut-ins who need helpers to do everything. Including sneeze. Be it by accident or design, the whole palace has not done anybody any favours.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Environmental:</strong> Some X-factor specific to the royal family's home location, diet, or environment is mucking things up.
<ul><li> Heavy metal poisoning, especially lead. (If you're looking for others to shake things up, antimony, mercury and arsenic are places to look: they've also had effects.) Seriously, it's a fashion at the moment for forensic archaeologists to imply this as the cause of most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">real world cases</a> of mad monarchs 1500-1815, the source primarily being lead makeup. There were a few reasons for this: lead makes for an easily applied and very white pigment... which aristocrats loved to whiten their skin with to emphasis how little outside work they had to undertake, as well as not to look sweaty or smell so bad (lead pigments also can act to some extent as deodorants). These same aristocrats stopped using makeup from about 1815-1920 for fashion and decency reasons (moral decency, that is); not coincidentally, the incidence of insanity among them dropped, although they weren't entirely clear on why at the time). Although lead in the booze and water (more from the lead used in distilling equipment and pipework than the relatively negligible amounts leached from the crystal glasses) has also been implicated.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fx2s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fx2s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fx2s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">More recently, the higher crime rates in the West and particularly the US 1960-1990 have been attributed to lead poisoning, from leaded gasoline and lead paint. "Lead is bad news" holds for everyone, evidently.</span>
<ul><li> There's also a fact that for most of the Classical Antiquity and Middle Ages the lead acetate was known as "sugar of lead" and thought to be a great sweetener: it's cheap, easy to produce and much sweeter than the other alternatives. In was widely used in cider-, perry- and winemaking, and given that for much of the period the preference was for very sweet, syrupy concoctions, it exposed the drinkers to far worse doses of lead than any lead plumbing could.
</li><li> Until the trade with India really picked up at the height of the Roman Republic, and cane sugar started to be imported, about the only sweeteners known in the Europe were honey and must  aka "boiled-up fruit juice or pressings" (see also <a class="urllink" href="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_cuit_(Suisse)">Swiss vin cuit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a direct, northern descendant similar to apple butter and <a class="urllink" href="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_cuit_(France)">French vin cuit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a direct southern descendant which is a concentrated wine). The juice of the sweet, ripe grapes famous around the Meditetranean is rich in glucose, and boiling the water off a lot concentrated the sugar; first into the syrupy<em> defrutum</em>, and then into the molasses-like <em>sapa</em>. Given the Romans penchant for lead utensils at every stage, one shouldn't be surprised that they widely used lead-soldered, lead-lined or just plain lead cauldrons to do so, which exposed a lot of lead to the acidic grape juice, leading to formation of the aforementioned lead acetate  as well as lead malate, lead ascorbate and other lead salts that naturally went right into the syrup. In fact, the lead acetate probably got its common name, "sugar of lead", because someone tasted the whitish crystals that formed on the rim of their defrutum-making pot.
</li><li> In East Asian, and especially Chinese, history, the main culprit for royal/imperial madness was not lead but mercury. For complicated reasons, the Chinese alchemists in particular insisted that mercury and its ore, cinnabar, were not only harmless, but key ingredients in any health tonic or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElixirOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElixirOfLife">elixir of immortality</a>. Naturally, Chinese emperors were all about immortality, and so many an emperor was prescribed the elixirs. You read that right; Chinese emperors willingly ate or drank mercury <em>to achieve immortality</em>. What's more, the alchemists were so sure that mercury was the key to eternal life that they did this for centuries, if not millenia—emperors of practically every dynasty are recorded to have died from it, from the first emperor of Qin in the third century BCE to the Yongzheng Emperor of Qing, who died in <em>1735</em>. That's almost <em>2,000 years</em> of emperors poisoning themselves. To beome immortal. Yes, we can feel the irony.

This links back to the heavy-metal poisoning: the common treatment before Salvarsan was <em>mercury</em>, and while that sometimes worked it also ran the risk of driving the patient a different kind of mad through mercury poisoning.

<ul><li> Firstly, the sisters as a whole are part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">incestuous</a> lesbian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>, where eldest daughter Claudette has a crush on youngest daughter Elina that goes unrequited (except in the <em>Hide &amp; Seek</em> continuity) because Elina is instead obsessively in love with the middle daughter, Leina.

</li><li> Claudette has serious issues with her family due to the fact that she's an illegitimate daughter and so not allowed to officially inherit the family estates, despite being the most formidable fighter. She does love her sisters, but at the same time she hates them, and she also feels torn between love &amp; loyalty and hate for her father. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In <em>Rebellion</em>, with a little magical coaxing from the Swamp Witch, her negative feelings turn her into a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>, thanks in part to Leina giving her the throne of Queen.</span>

Her younger brother D'Ken is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConquerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConquerer">Galactic Conquerer</a> who threatened the whole universe, while their Lilandra, on other hand, is quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen">a stable ruler</a>, but has tendency to get dethroned frequently.

But nature abhors a vacuum. Plourr Ilo, revealed as the last confirmed survivor of the main royal family after the other nobles had a bloody revolution (her story was loosely based off of the legend of Anastasia), tells the other characters why the man rumored to be her brother (who's a new kind of revolutionary, this time for the common folk) can't be him.
<div class="indent">"All those years of dipping from the same genetic pool caused a wrinkle, a flaw in an otherwise normal family line. We set out to keep ourselves above the common man and found ourselves with a thing from the deepest pit of the Sith."

Although Changeling culture is primarily based off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a>, the royal family has a reputation of intermarriage amongst its members that, throughout generations has led to many physical and mental disabilities and illnesses much more similar to those of old European royalty. Queen Chrysalis appears to have dodged most of these ailments, but her daughter and heir, Crown Princess Pupa is both heavily mentally and physically disabled. Pupa, at the time of the fanfiction, is approximately the same age as the Cutie Mark Crusaders, yet she can neither walk or talk, and is treated as virtually an infant and carried around as one by her careers. She is comparable to King Charles II of Spain and Feodor I of Russia. As one commentator remarked, <em>"the Changeling royalty is essentially a tour of all the screwed up monarchies of Europe."</em>, again ironic as the culture is primarily Japanese.

She also points out an increasing number of Squibs and prevalence of learning disorders among the surviving Pureblood children, and calculates that the Death Eater war hastened the fatal genetic bottleneck by 200 years, because it killed off a substantial chunk of the remaining gene pool. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She covers these findings up in her official Ministry report but tells Snape in private.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog">Hurog</a></em> family tends to sadism and jerkishness in the male line. More precisely, everyone who lives in castle Hurog is affected in some way, some suffer inexplicable psychological issues, others are suicidal. The fact that the castle was built by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a>, who turned his bastard son into the child in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">Powered by a Forsaken Child</a>, by turning him into a kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">Genius Loci</a> that is enslaved, and compelled to serve the head of the family, is probably responsible for that — not so much the genes, as the fact that all heirs of the title live in this castle. Evil is not good for your sanity, and owning a slave whose very <em>soul</em> is bound to obey tends to weaken the moral backbone of those who didn't have much decency to begin with. Oreg, the above-mentioned slave, wrote a curse/prophesy on the wall some couples of centuries ago, but that, if at all, only contributed to the paranoia, as he did is as reaction to something very cruel his then master did.

Thanks to inbreeding and genetic damage caused by environmental factors, some of the Vorbarra rulers have been... problematic:
<ul><li> Mad Emperor Yuri killed off most of his own family and then got dismembered and scalped by his own nobles, led by his brother in law/cousin.
</li><li> Yuri's brother in law/cousin/successor Ezar was a relativly sane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster</a>, but was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">ruthlessly amoral</a> beyond belief. The man signed off on a pointlessly aggressive war <em>he knew Barrayar would lose</em> to topple his political enemies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">kill his own son</a>.
</li><li> Ezar's son Serg was a twisted sadist who probably would have destroyed the Imperium if he'd been allowed to take the throne. Ezar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">killed him</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a> (too bad about the grunts).
</li><li> Serg's son Gregor inherited the throne at age five when Ezar died, and, remarkably, grew up sane and stable thanks mostly to his adoptive parents, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cincinnatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cincinnatus">Aral Vorkosigan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist">Cordelia Naismith Vorkosigan</a>. But Gregor became so paranoid about the genetic insanity in his family line that he refused to consider marrying anyone even <em>distantly</em> related to him.

<ul><li> Fortunately Barrayar has recently gotten a handle on genetic engineering, eased up on the social stratification, and annexed another planet with its own unrelated set of merchant nobility (one of whom Gregor eventually married), so that nasty strain of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisLatinicus">nutjobbus maximus</a></em> is likely to be cleansed from the line in the future.

<ul><li> The main curse of madness/misfortune/sterility/whatever would make things most difficult in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfChalion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfChalion">The Curse of Chalion</a></em> is particularly nasty, in that it automatically spreads to anyone who marries into the family, making it completely impossible to eradicate without, as it turns out, <em>direct intervention from the gods</em>. The unlucky king Orico tried to short-circuit it by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting his wife, Sara, pregnant by his chancellor, because any child of theirs would not be part of the cursed royal bloodline</span>. It didn't work because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sara was barren and also the chancellor was evil and his brother was an evil whackjob</span>, but one gets the impression it was a clingy curse that would have come down on <em>whoever</em> inherited the throne, as well anyone around them who could potentially have finagled a way out. Thus, it took a miracle in the end.
</li><li> And then there's that strange familial wolf-madness thing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHallowedHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHallowedHunt">The Hallowed Hunt</a></em>, too. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Revealed not to be madness, but an ancient shamanistic tradition that creates powerful animal spirits linked to certain rulers; the protagonist's dad just had the bad luck to pick a sacrificial animal that was rabid and bit him before it died, and the poor protagonist wound up convinced his own wolf-spirit would do the same to him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Present in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings">David Eddings</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em>, in the form of the royal line of Cthol Murgos, the Urgas family, with its hereditary insanity. In sequel series <em>The Mallorean</em>, the eventual successor to the throne is more or less sane, which makes sense, given that he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not actually the son of the crazy late king, but instead the product of a brief affair between one of the king's wives and a foreign diplomat.</span> That's one effective way to get the crazy genes out of the royal line.
<ul><li> Made even more effective by the traditional method of ensuring easy succession: whoever gets the throne has every other potential claimant assassinated. <em>Legally</em>. Maybe the Murgos have had problems like this before...
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> — the early Ottoman Empire tried to cut down on wars of succession by having all male relatives of a newly crowned sultan put to death. Predictably this only <em>increased</em> the number of succession wars, as every potential claimant to the throne knew that upon the death of the old sultan he had to either win the crown or die. Urgit's quote of "It was either the throne or the block." in <em>King of the Murgos</em> is drawn straight from history.
</li></ul></li><li> The various Tolnedran imperial dynasties tended towards this as well. Typically the first few emperors of a dynasty would be clever, competent men, but after several generations of inbreeding the line eventually devolved into rulers who were insane, imbeciles, or both. And then subverted by the Borunes, who by their contractual obligations have to marry Dryads. Introducing exogamy into the family line every generation must help. Of course, female members of the Borune family are Dryads also (and exclusively Dryads, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">there's no such thing as a female half-Dryad</a>)...

He committed an action so terrible that every single member of his family changed their names and refused to take up the sovereignty — although only people like Dame Ceinwen remember even that much of the story, and nobody remembers the specifics. Ever since, there have been Lords of Mochdreff rather than rulers styling themselves princes, until finally, due to the lack of a clear heir to the previous Lord, Prince Tryffin was appointed Royal Governor and took it upon himself to try to clean up the matter once and for all by getting to the bottom of the curse.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series, the Rahl family line, for several generations, have been warmongering psychopaths. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The protagonist</span> is, depending on the reader, either an exception or adhering to the rule.

This, coupled with the fact that the Egyptian gods are basically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so obsessed with ritual that they've become willingly comatose</span>, made the country weak and unstable enough for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">the Amazons</a> to take over.
</li><li> In P.C. Hodgell's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfTheKencyrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfTheKencyrath">Chronicles of the Kencyrath</a></em>, the house of Knorth, from which the ruling Highlords come, has what appears to be an inherited tendency toward madness. Torisen, the current Highlord, is terrified of what lurks in his bloodlines, and of becoming like his father and grandfather. Inbreeding and deliberate breeding for Shanir (magical) traits is probably responsible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em>'s Marlfoxes. The mother Silth is a raving maniac, her youngest is a sneak who deliberately feeds her mother's paranoia in order to weasel (or fox?) her way into power, and the oldest six offspring are just plain nasty to various degrees.

Particular mention is made of Mad King Alain, who was truly a raving and unstable lunatic but did his people the favor of dying quickly — he decided to go outside and play games on the lawn during a raging thunderstorm (lunatic, remember?) and got struck by lightning.
</li><li> The Argaven kings of Karhide in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness">The Left Hand of Darkness</a></em> are described as congenitally mad. This seems to be accepted as part of the nature of kings on Gethen.
</li><li> The page quote comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, in which the royal Targaryen line is said to be blessed with greatness as much as it is cursed with madness, in part due to centuries of inbreeding to keep the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower">Blood of Old Valyria</a>" pure. It started with the first Targaryen king, who was a great man but unfortunately married and had children with both of his sisters (a family tradition); from there on out it's been a crapshoot. The line has produced many able warriors, statesmen, and scholars as well as a rogue's gallery of tyrants and psychopaths. Some Targaryens begin quite noble and lose their grip on sanity as they age, such as King Aerys II — by the end of his reign, he was known as King Aerys the Mad, and in the end his excesses sparked a revolt that toppled the dynasty. Daenerys, the only POV character with Targaryen blood (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">so far as we know</a>), seems more sound of mind than her relatives, but is a bit delusional and idealistic, and would do well to take the advice of those around her. The books give us only one normal Targaryen <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(two if you count Jon Snow)</span> — Maester Aemon, as even the much liked Rhaegar was bipolar and had delusions of grandeur.
<ul><li> The Lannisters seem to be heading the inbred-madness route, too: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> King Joffrey and his siblings Myrcella and Tommen</span> are the product of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Queen Cersei (married to King Robert, whom she hates) and her twin brother Jaime. Jaime and Cersei's parents were first cousins</span>. Cersei is a paranoid schemer who eventually engineers her own downfall, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joffrey,</span> her son was sadistic and unstable and had to be put down by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Littlefinger and the Tyrells</span>. Hopefully averted with Prince Tommen and Princess Myrcella, who are both perfectly sweet children... for now.
<ul><li> Well, the incest might be a factor (and, those who believe Stannis will no doubt jump on that explanation). However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Joffrey</a> really didn't have a chance: his mother both spoiled and smothered him as well as refused to let anybody else educate him... while neglecting such things as mathematics, ethics, psychology, and <em>reading</em>. His father, although not exactly abusive, was both distant and neglectful. Anybody else who could have stepped in to discipline or direct him were either chased off (Maesters) or never spotted the problem until far too late (Grandfather, Father-by-blood and Uncle).
</li></ul></li><li> The Targaryen madness is, in truth, highly overrated.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> Aegon I — Perfectly normal, <br/> his son Aenys I — Fairly normal, if a bit indecisive, <br/> his half-brother Maegor I — Psychopathic murderer, <br/> his nephew Jaehaerys I — Best king Westeros ever had, <br/> his grandson Viserys I — Aside from not clearing up his line of succession, quite normal, <br/> his son Aegon II — Paranoid, but for good reason, however lustful and unpleasant <br/> his nephew Aegon III — Depression, but stemming from watching his mother be devoured by a dragon rather than genetics, <br/> his son Daeron I — Became king far too young but not actually crazy, <br/> his brother Baelor I — Religious fanatic but nonetheless loved, <br/> his uncle Viserys II — Kept his nephews from imploding the realm during their reigns, but died before he could finish the job as king himself <br/> his son Aegon IV — Obese, corrupt, and horribly ineffectual, <br/> his son Daeron II — Second best king Westeros ever had, <br/> his son Aerys I — Obsessed with books to the exclusion of all else, including having children, <br/> his brother Maekar I — As stern, harsh, and unyielding as his great-great-grandson Stannis and even more unpopular but again not crazy, <br/> his son Aegon V — Sane aside from maybe the Summerhall incident and well-known for his kindness to the smallfolk, <br/> his son Jaehaerys II — Often considered weak due to his poor health and short reign but thought well of by anyone who actually knew him, managed to do some good things during his brief time <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3nwn9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3nwn9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3nwn9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">End the Blackfyre Rebellions and reconcile the Great Houses </span> <br/> and his son Aerys II — Psychopathic pyromaniac.
</div><ul><li> That's only three crazy kings, two borderline crazy kings, and one horribly incompetent one out of the seventeen monarchs. If you want to count the Targaryens who never became kings, only Rhaegal (brother of Aerys I and Maekar), Aerion (brother of Aegon V), and maybe Viserys (brother of Daenerys) were crazy.
</li><li> The Targaryen madness really seems to be prominent in the more recent generations. Aerys II was the craziest of the lot, both of his sons had problems, his daughter isn't that much better (although whether she's actually mad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">is a highly controversial debate topic)</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his possible surviving grandson also has issues (which actually convinces Tyrion that he really is a Targaryen), although his other grandson (who is unaware of his true lineage) is fine other than being pretty emo at times</span>.
<ul><li> While Rhaegar's villainy is currently up in the air, there's no doubt that he was rather delusional. Best case scenario, he ran away with the teenage daughter of a lord paramount (the most powerful noble families) who was engaged to another lord paramount and then proceeded to do nothing while her family was killed by his crazy father (who everyone knew was crazy). All this while he was married to the sister of yet another lord paramount (the "Prince" of Dorne). Worst case, he was a prophecy-obsessed fanatic who raped a young girl until she was pregnant and then left her alone with just a couple knights for company.
</li></ul></li><li> It's unknown how many Targaryens were passed over for the throne due to either mental defects or poor physical health. The insanity problem became prevalent enough that the councils would try to skip over the crazy or sickly Targaryen in the line of succession in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">a more stable younger son or nephew</a>. And in later generations, a significant number were born with moderate to severe mental defects, or "feeble-witted".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note47hwo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note47hwo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note47hwo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This applied to Aerion Blackfyre's daughter and at least several more children, but because they were never seriously considered in the line of succession, little was recorded about them.</span> Even their physical health was eventually effected, with several being intellectually and emotionally normal but possessing such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">fragile immune systems</a> that they suffered from numerous ailments and died young. Stillbirths and cradle deaths were <em>very</em> common, even when you consider that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">this is Westeros</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5hwag');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5hwag" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5hwag');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Dany's mother, Queen Rhaella, had no less than two stillbirths, three miscarriages, and three infant sons who were born alive but so sickly that none of them lived more than a year.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>, there once was a King by the name of Palancar who tried to wage war numerous times with the Elves, even though every invasion was a hopeless crusade (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, a historian indicates Palancar was in the early stages of dementia by that point). Eventually his nobles rebelled against him to end the madness and had him exiled into a valley that later inherited his name. The Protagonist and his cousin, and the village they grew up in, descended from Palancar. Paolini so far has acted like that's at least somewhat of a <em>good</em> thing. Then again, he's also trying to convince us that the one who's really Royally Screwed-up is Galby.
</li><li> Fiona Patton's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheBranionRealm">Branion</a> series is set in a fantasy Britain where the gods take an active interest in their followers. The royal family, whose head is called the Aristok, is literally touched by the gods — the sovereign is the avatar of the Living Flame, a deity/demon/primordial critter which is a sort of symbiotic parasite. This makes the Aristok something of a cross between a hereditary Christ-figure and the real British system of the monarch being head of the church. Not only does the Aristok have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRightOfKings">divine right</a>, she can prove it. Unfortunately, being the physical sacred vessel-on-earth of a <em>fire god</em> is bad for your health. Out of forty-one monarchs, sixteen have died young, been assassinated, or committed suicide, and many of the rest went insane. Three even converted to a completely different faith, which made for real cognitive dissonance among their followers as well as themselves. Whether this system is a blessing or a curse on the royal family is clearly up in the air.
</li><li> The first two of Mervyn Peake's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gormenghast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gormenghast">Gormenghast</a></em> books are, among other things, a long examination of this trope — the Groan lineage and their staff are a bunch of depressed lunatics, their spirits both crushed and perversely sustained by the castle and its ancient, messed-up rituals. They are a sympathetic bunch though — the melancholy and bookish Lord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Sepulchrave</a> and his unloved, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">cloudcuckoolander</a> daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia">Fuchsia</a> must surely be among the most tragic literary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">woobies</a> of the last century.
</li><li> Zigzagged throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels.
<ul><li> Historically, the rulers of Ankh-Morpork have tended to be raving psychopaths. This may have been somewhat genetic while the city was a monarchy and rulers' marriages were arranged to maintain the royal blood and survival tended to favor those homicidal enough to keep ahead of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a>. However, even after the kings were overthrown and replaced by the non-hereditary Patricians, the stress of the job and the absolute power that came with it turned pretty much everyone who held it some flavor of barking mad. The last two Patricians were known as "Mad Lord Snapcase" and "Homicidal Lord Winder". By a stroke of <em>incredible</em> good fortune the current Patrician, Lord Havelock Vetinari, is not only sane but an utter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> and as insurance, the rightful heir to the line of kings is also hanging around the city, and he's also sane-ish, as he was raised by dwarfs (his adoptive father was in fact a king, but among dwarfs that job corresponds to "mine director" and appears to be elective, not hereditary).
</li><li> The old noble houses of Ankh-Morpork, from which the Patricians are usually chosen, certainly haven't done themselves any favors through repeated intermarriage but, as with the royal line, this is implied to have contributed less to their overall unpleasantness than the self-selection towards dimwitted murder-happy prats (because of the military service requirement) and the self-absorption encouraged by privilege.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em> zigzags this with the Agatean Emperor. While his insanity is suggested to have a dash of genetic inbreeding behind it, the book hints (yet <em>again</em>) that <em>intentionally</em> breeding for paranoia and psychopathy, and then not telling the offspring why cruelty is bad, may have actually played a larger role than how closely related his parents were. Lord Hong, the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, subverts the trope entirely by simply being a self-made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> without any of Vetinari's redeeming scruples.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">Pyramids</a></em> thankfully manages to avoid this, although it is specifically mentioned that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> had intended to wed the protagonist with his aunt in order to keep the royal line <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood">"pure"</a>.
</li><li> Played utterly straight when one book describes the lineage of kings in other Discworld city-states, and cites the last King of Quirm as having been so inbred he repeatedly tried to mate with himself.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance">Jack Vance</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lyonesse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lyonesse">Lyonesse</a></em> trilogy, the king of South Ulfland's single son, Prince Quilcy, is feeble-minded and spends his days playing with fanciful doll-houses.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Tortall</a></em> books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a>, the Copper Isles royalty tend to have madness crop up now and then, including one Princess Josiane. A character phrases it thus: "There's bad blood in the Copper Isles kings. They birth a mad one every generation. Josiane's uncle is locked in a tower somewhere. It comes from being an island kingdom — too much inbreeding." It turns out in further novels that it may not be just one per generation...
<ul><li> Two per generation, as of the Trickster books. The old king who dies and prompts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> and his brother who was mentioned as locked in a tower somewhere, and Josiane and Imajane among the old king's kids.
</li><li> The Jimajen line might also have bits of this, though we only see two members: Rubinyan, whose only major flaws are an overdeveloped sense of honor and an inability to control his insane wife; and Bronau, who is extremely egotistical and ambitious without much common sense to go with it. Big brother is also ambitious as hell, but much more sensible...
</li><li> Emperor Ozorne of Carthak and that cousin of the Tusaine line who starts the Tusaine-Tortall war in the second Song of the Lioness book both count.
</li><li> Duke Roger, nephew to King Roald in the Song of the Lioness quartet, wasn't insane to begin with, but coming back from the dead (or not, precisely, if you believe him) certainly screwed with his head.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner">Tamír Trilogy</a></em> (<em>The Bone Doll's Twin</em>, <em>Hidden Warrior</em>, and <em>The Oracle's Queen</em>) hereditary madness has hit the royal line. What makes this particularly dangerous is that the country's god has declared that only women of that bloodline can become ruler... or else. At the end...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the sanest remaining member of the royal line takes the throne and the madness that caused the whole situation is just never mentioned again, since the epilogue indicates that there were no problems for centuries afterwards.</span>
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series with the Star Kingdom of Manticore. Aside from being a constitutional monarchy, which limits the potential damage, Manticoran monarchs and heirs apparent are specifically prohibited from marrying members of the aristocracy. Aside from the "keeping in touch with the common folk" goal, it also removes the problems of inbreeding.
<ul><li> He swiped this from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith">E. E. Doc Smith</a>'s <em>Family d'Alembert</em> series; under the Stanley Doctrine, nobility <em>could</em> marry commoners, but royalty was <em>required</em> to marry a commoner. While this helped, this was not totally successful in keeping loonies from the Imperial Throne (granted, the case of Empress "Mad Stephanie" could have been situational rather than genetic.)
<ul><li> In the case of the Stanley Dynasty, it may be as much cultural as genetic. At one point the competent, sane, and decent Emperor William (who is definitely an exception to the run of his ancestors) makes a joke about his and his wife's decision to abdicate at his age 70, so their daughter Edna "won't have to kill us." Edna is horrified by the joke, but her father points out that if he'd been more grasping and determined to hang on to power forever, decent Edna might have turned out different too, because, as he notes, 'like begets like'.
</li></ul></li><li> The author even points out that if the Monarch is really bonkers, Impeachment is in the Constitution, with Parliament choosing the new Monarch from any person in the Kingdom.
<ul><li> And before being added to the official line of succession, the Monarch's offspring have to pass a psychological and intelligence evaluation.
</li></ul></li><li> The Andermani Emperors on the other hand are competent but sometimes <em>strange</em>: the first emperor thought he was a reincarnation of Friedrich der Grosse (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick the Great</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia">Prussia</a>). Another was dethroned when he not only talked to his prize rose bush but also tried to make it chancellor.
<ul><li> And he was deposed by his own sister, who, while generally considered the best Andermani Emperor ever, had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing">legally declare herself a man</a>, due to their Salic Law succession. May not have been the best decision for her own mental state.
</li><li> It's hinted the reason why they are so successful is that the insanity and the genius go together. After all founding a New Prussian Empire on a Chinese colony world and making it into a regional power does sound pretty nuts. The first Emperor was a rich space pirate who saved the colony from starvation.
</li></ul></li><li> Actually, while she's generally sane, Queen Elizabeth III does have her own set of issues. Her temper, for instance, is usually described as "volcanic".
</li></ul></li><li> The Civil Government of the planet Bellevue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGeneral">The General</a></em> series qualifies as both the current governor and his acknowledged heir are borderline clinical paranoids, and becoming less borderline all the time...
<ul><li> Though, considering the political climate in the Gubierno Civil, the line between clinical paranoia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">sane, reasonable social caution</a> is slim indeed. The <em>only</em> reasons the POV character isn't a threat to the throne are his incorruptible idealism and his sure knowledge of the disaster that will ensue if he tries to take the throne for himself. Also, while the Cleretts my or my not be insane, they are also competent, if perhaps not excellent, political and military leaders.
</li><li> A better example would be Settler Ali ibn'Jamal of the Colony, who is just an old-school psychopath.
</li></ul></li><li> The pureblooded Ancient and Most Noble House of Black from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> has a long history of insanity and inbreeding. Most pureblood wizarding families (with a few exceptions, like the Weasleys, who aren't hostile to mixed or Muggle-born in-laws) have gone this direction in recent decades, as the limited gene pool means they're all increasingly interrelated. Arthur Weasley says at one point that purebloods by the current definition will probably die out within a couple generations, as so many of them are already first cousins and within the incest taboo. Ironically, the Death Eaters probably managed to hasten this extinction quite a bit since many purebloods died in the fighting or were consigned to Azkaban afterwards.
<ul><li> The Gaunts are even <em>more</em> messed up and inbred than most purebloods, since Dumbledore mentions that they were the only remaining descendants of Salazar Slytherin and Marvolo was obsessed with the inferiority of other families. Ironically, the worst member of the family is conceived when they finally manage to get some new blood: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lord Voldemort</a>, the son of Merope Gaunt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">and a Muggle</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, the first king of the Noldor, Finwë, is a good man, but after his death, the crown goes to his eldest son Fëanor, who was very paranoid before, and became completely crazy (if still very charismatic) when his father was murdered. Once Fëanor is also dead, his son Maedhros should become king...but he averts this trope: knowing how dangerous the Oath he and his brothers have sworn is, he abdicates and lets his uncle rule. It's a wise move: the sons of Fëanor do commit some horrendous acts, and the two eldest eventually become insane, but at least they only rule a fraction of the Noldor.
<ul><li> The royal family of Númenor also develop into this, as they become more and more jealous of the Elves for their long life, and determined to find a way to live forever. This culminates in the last ruler of Númenor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">basically declaring war on God</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">losing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering">horribly</a>.

<ul><li> And even the good kings still tend to be royally screwed up. Witness David, whose punishment for committing adultery with Bathsheba and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">having her husband killed</a> was that his first son by her fell ill and died a week later, and the rest of the sons started killing each other for various reasons. David ultimately appoints Solomon as his successor, and even then the succession crisis doesn't end. Solomon was also messed up in his own right on account of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRuinsTheRealm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRuinsTheRealm">harem of foreign wives.</a>

And the newly-crowned Selenay plays it to the hilt to keep her councilors from forcing her into marriage, too. The requirement that all monarchs must be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Heralds</a> is also very important — there's nothing saying a Herald can't be a bit nuts (Hi, Lavan and Vanyel!), but at least it's the type of nuts that doesn't result in the abuses seen on the rest of this page.
</li><li> King Rodric IV in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle">The Riftwar Cycle</a></em>. Hated and abused by his father for being a sickly runt, he proved to be as sick in mind as he was in body. Apart from using openly about how his power would allow him to randomly pick out random people and have them executed for no reason other than he wished to see them die, he squandred much of the tax revenues of The Kingdom Of The Isles on a series of aesthetic public works programs designed merely to make the city of Rillanon look prettier. Worse still, he denied vital military aid to the Western half of his Kingdom, fearing that the soldiers would be used to build an army against him, which helped to drag the first Riftwar out for the better part of a decade.
</li><li> Though not quite royalty, the Usher family in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> 's <em>Fall of the House of Usher</em> fits. An illness that causes madness runs in the family, and it's implied to be due to inbreeding.
</li><li> A rather desperate attempt to prevent this touched off the entire plot of A.L. Phillips's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuestOfTheUnaligned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuestOfTheUnaligned">The Quest of the Unaligned</a>. The royal house of the realm of Caederan, instead of being tied to one of the four elemental magics, are tied to all of them as the result of an ancient magical bargain binding the King and Queen to Caederan itself. Unfortunately, this means that if the King and Queen favor one element over the others, this will throw the land itself out of whack. A few decades before the story started, King Kethel and Queen Tathilya became increasingly infatuated with the power of air, which also had the side effect of causing them to become increasingly flighty and absent-minded. As the Balance fell further and further towards wind, the country was wracked by droughts, tornadoes, cyclones, and other catastrophes. When Queen Tathilya became pregnant, the nobles realized that if the new prince was raised in the royal court, he to would become infatuated with air magic. The nobles launched a desperate bid to separate Prince Alaric from the ruahk-controlled Court, and thus begins the plot.

</li><li> It also turns out that Paul and Alia Atreides are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harkonnens too, thanks to their mother who is Vladimirs biological daughter</span>. Paul is not much of a monster like his grandpa as most of his detractors think; its just that he fell in a prescient trap and couldnt control things such as his rabid followers. His sister is indeed messed up because her mother consumed spice and inherited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">Genetic Memory</a> of the past Reverend Mothers and all of their ancestors while pregnant.

In the past, they made tons of effort to create the Kwisatz Haderach but it produced a lot of failures (e.g. Count Hasimir Fenring).

Emperor Cartagia was as bad as any fiction-version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a>, and apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">modeled after him</a>. Interestingly, the position of Emperor does not seem to be connected to any individual line for more than a few generations; it appears to be totally normal for the Centauri nobles to hand the throne to a new House even though the old imperial house still exists (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Londo rules as Mollari II, as one of his ancestors had held the throne once</span>). This presumably means that Cartagia's madness was a relatively rare occurrence in his House — rather as the Julio-Claudians only had two Emperors who could be called insane (Caligula and Nero), only one of whom (Caligula) was <em>totally</em> bonkers (Nero, while an awful ruler, was not <em>totally</em> incompetent; he was just very young when he took the throne, too obsessed with drama—in both senses—and not very well brought up).

The crazy rate is implied to be around 50% (as per the page quote), regardless of how long the inbreeding has been practiced. Technically the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lannister</span> case isn't a single generation; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jaime and Cersei</span> are first generation sibling incest, but their parents were first cousins. And since no particular fuss is made over that fact, it can be assumed that cousin incest is not uncommon in the Lannister family. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cersei and Jaime</span> were far from the first incestuous pairing in the family, but they were probably the straw that broke the camel's back.

Tytos had a desire to please that made him a doormat, Tywin sees people as tools for his work, as mentioned above the twins are unpleasant, Tyrion is an alcoholic dwarf with terrible family relations, Lancel is a zealot, and there is one who just smashes beetles while screaming crunk. In later Targaryen generations, some were born with moderate to severe mental defects, or "feeble-witted". Even their physical health was eventually effected, with several being intellectually and emotionally normal but possessing such fragile health that they suffered from numerous ailments and died young.
</li><li> Selyse is blatantly unstable, due to the trauma of so many stillbirths and her inability to produce a male heir for Stannis. Writer Bryan Cogman confirmed that the reason she became the first person on Dragonstone to embrace the new Lord of Light religion (even before Stannis) is because she couldn't process that the Seven would let her unborn sons die, so like many people in traumatic situations, she fanatically embraced a new religion.

</li><li> Ouroboros, also known as Just, claims to be the son of Nex and Serin as part of a ruse by Serin's father, and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> who takes sadistic pleasure in tormenting his "brother" Ninurta and really anyone he can get his hooks into.
<ul><li> Ouroboros is also the creation of Oski and brother of Skoll, the wolf demon sealed inside Xix.

He is completely thunderstruck when he discovers that he may be Nex's son after a blood ritual. This is after Nex defeats, tortures, and nearly kills him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He was left at the village by a beautiful woman in flashbacks drawn looking like Serin and left with her family's magical artifact Semek. He was actually killed and then resurrected by Siana in previously mentioned massacre. After said resurrection, he proceeds in a daze to tear out Siana's heart and take it into his own body.... then we learn of a prophecy saying that Jae Huk's first son with Serin would be lost to him. The revelations with Ninurta just complicates his potential origin.</span>
<ul><li> Also the host of Skoll, a wolf demon created by Oski related to Ouroboros the snake demon.

Xix thought she died when his village was destroyed, but in truth a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">post-resurrection haze</a> Xix tore out her heart to took it into his own body. Afterward her body was taken by Caladbolg and he had his forces work to save her. She reappears later in the present aligned with Caladbolg, and they believe each other to be uncle and niece. Her true body is with the Night Clan and she normally interacts via replicated one her consciousness is tied to.</span>
</li><li> Miya: The only one to get away from this <em>relatively</em> clean. Indisputably Nex and Iffrita's daughter, she is a sickly little girl who cannot even comprehend how messed up her family is. Xix, Ninurta and Nex all care for her deeply (the former initially in opposition to his own vendetta) the fact that she actually looks like Nex often causes people to draw comparisons with how Ninurta does not.

Depending on the version of the myth you hear, Uranus was either Gaia's brother, son, or a completely unrelated entity; regardless, they proceeded to have three groups of children, two of which (the Hecatoncheires and the Cyclopes) turned out monstrously ugly. The third group proceeded to intermarry with each other and have kids of their own; one such pairing resulted in the births of Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia, who then proceeded to marry and/or sleep with each other, each other's kids, and on at least one occasion grandma Gaia herself. While they had more than their fair share of family drama to go around, the later generations were remarkably free from physical deformities and mental illness, with the standout exception being Hephaestus, son of Hera and sometimes Zeus.

Maxmillion Liao was driven nuts after falling to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Hanse Davion's</a> schemes in the 4th Succession War and was left a broken shell until his death.

She spent the next few decades becoming increasingly paranoid and instituting numerous bloody purges of her own people as a result of that paranoia, further crippling the badly battered realm. Her son, Sun Tzu, was mostly sane (though he had his moments) but her daughter, Kali, was completely off the deep end and believed herself to be the actual Hindu diety. The fact that the Capellan state religion views House Liao as actual divine beings certainly didn't help in that regard, either. Kali was responsible for organizing numerous terrorist attacks in the Confederation and on other worlds. And then there's Daoshen, Sun Tzu's heir. Again, he believes himself to be a god, he's hyper-aggressive and paranoid, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">his niece is actually his daughter</a>.</span> Insanity doesn't just run in the family, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ArsenicAndOldLace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ArsenicAndOldLace">it practically gallops</a>.

Most of them are temporal royalty of some sort as well.
<ul><li> The Bortisis are related to Ivana Bortisi, Darklord of Borca, although most of them run the Bortisi Trading Company. While they aren't cursed as badly as the others in this list, they do have a definite thing for poisons.
</li><li> The d'Honaires are related to Dominic d'Honaire, Darklord of Dementlieu. They tend to be sickly but with a gift for healing, and to be either kindhearted and empathic or cold-blooded sociopaths. d'Honaires in Dementlieu are also immune to supernatural mental modification, as part of Dominic's curse.
</li><li> The Dilisnya are related to Ivan Dilisnya, co-Darklord of Borca (and also Camille, previous darklord of Borca before Ivana poisoned her). They're largely known as the core of a massive criminal network.
</li><li> The Drakovs are related to Vlad Drakov, Darklord of Falkovnia and blatant Vlad the Impaler expy. They have a tendency for berserking, and they are cursed to always end up becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> if they accept a place in the family. Also, most people hate them because of their progenitor's terrible reputation.
</li><li> The Godefroys are related to Wilfred Godefroy, Darklord of Mordent (although not directly, due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaterFamilicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaterFamilicide">Pater Familicide</a>). They are largely sickly, as well as natural mediums.
</li><li> The Hiregaard family is related to Tristen Hiregaard, ruler of Nova Vaasa. They are cursed with a tendency towards insanity, especially if they commit evil acts.
</li><li> The Mordenheims are related to Viktor Mordenheim, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who created Lamordia's flesh golem Darklord Adam, and is cursed along with him.

</li><li> The Reniers are related to Jaqueline Renier, Darklord of Richemulot. The family is also tainted with a wererat branch, resulting in even human Reniers being vulnerable to infection with wererat-style lycanthropy (the natural wererats are cursed so that one in every six children born to a wererat mother will be pure human). They're also cursed with a potentially fatal allergy to something innocuous.
</li><li> The Von Zaroviches are related to Strahd von Zarovich, Darklord of Barovia (but not directly- he doesn't have any children) and have no less than <em>four</em> family curses- susceptibility to the attentions of the Dark Powers, chronic nightmares, berserker rages, and being prone to visions of horror if wounded in battle. Thankfully they need not all apply to the same person at once. They are prone to being evil, but this isn't universal.

During the most decadent period of the Empire's history, it's implied that inbreeding reached epic proportions and led to actual mutations among the nobility. They seem to have straightened things out for the most part by the "present day" though. Thank Sigmar for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">witch hunters</a>, eh?

<ul><li> On one hand, the Emperor brought a new golden age to the galaxy and most of his sons were initially stable (The exceptions being Kurze, a murderous sociopath; Angron, a blood-crazed berserker; Lorgar, a raving zealot; Alpharius, who had colossal delusions of grandeur; and quite possibly the twins, whose names were wiped from history for reasons unknown). On the far less lenient hand, he was also a stubborn egomaniac who couldn't be bothered to change his mind when he started ruling humanity. His intolerant holier-than-thou attitude on his sons (<em>especially</em> Lorgar) drove some to madness, which started the fall.
</li></ul></li><li> The Navigators have a special mutation that happens to be great for getting through the Warp quickly, making them vital to the Imperium's functioning. Said mutation is also recessive. Because of this, it's essentially required that they only produce offspring with other navigators, who make up a number of noble families on Terra. When you consider that mutations are common in the setting, they already have a mutation anyway, and they're given relative carte blanche to have as many mutations as they want, many scions of navigator families end up being genetic tumbleweeds who barely even look human after generations of inbreeding.

<ul><li> Henry VI had some kind of mental illness which left him near-catatonic for long periods. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8cyl5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8cyl5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8cyl5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There were theories suggesting that Henry's mental health declined significantly after he received the continuous stream of bad news that is England's losses in France during the final stages of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a>. On hearing of the final loss of Bordeaux in August 1453, he experienced a mental breakdown and became completely unresponsive to everything that was going on around him for more than a year.</span> It may have been inherited from the French royals; Henry's French grandfather, Charles VI, was also mentally ill, sometimes claiming to be made of glass. Charles's madness led to a civil war, and a English invasion — Agincourt and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc">Joan of Arc</a>; Henry's madness led to the War of the Roses — two wars, one of which effectively purged the English royal line of madness by almost exterminating it. This shows that occasionally Real Life can be more sensible than fiction: most medieval kings had to be competent, or they got removed.
<ul><li> Charles VI's madness was triggered by two traumatic events, the first possibly induced by sunstroke, the second by the notorious <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_des_Ardents">"ball of the burning men"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which Charles himself came close to being burnt alive. And while Britons like to point the finger at Charles VI as being to blame for Henry VI's madness, it should be noted that his French offspring was not crazy, but actually seemed to have been pretty smart and rational by the standards of their day, in particular his grandson Louis XI, known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">the Universal Spider</a>, and his Louis's daughter Anne de Beaujeu, who very competently ruled France and won another civil war during the minority of her younger brother Charles VIII. Of course to some people the real reason for the troubles of the royal house of France until the 19th century was that Philip the Fair and his successors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">had been cursed by the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar">last Grand Master of the Knights Templar when he was burned at the stake</a>.
</li><li> Much later there was <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeIII">George III</a>, of the "talking-to-a-tree-because-he-thought-it-was-the-king-of-Prussia" style of crazy, but that was an isolated incident and might even have been made up by his son, George IV, who had to rule as regent for years while they waited for him to die. (These are—theoretically—the Georges that turn up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a> the Third</em>, incidentally.) The Hanoverian monarchs had an unspoken family tradition of having bad relationships with their oldest sons (from George I and George II to Victoria and Edward VII, not one British monarch had a good relationship with his/her eldest male child) and George IV is known to have cruelly parodied George III's condition in front of his friends in London clubs. IV himself was more a case of 'just about sane enough' than completely well-balanced; fortunately, power was sufficiently shared with Parliament by this time that a sane-ish monarch was good enough, and in any case the only thing George IV <em>wanted</em> to use power for (outside of a last-stand opposition to Catholic Emancipation, which his ministers talked him out of) was to deprive his wife of her privileges as queen.
<ul><li> George III only developed madness in later life — earlier in life he was charming, handsome and reasonably well-adjusted. Recent theories suggest that this may have been due to a genetic condition called porphyria that is hereditary, it just tends to skip several generations without manifesting. May have entered the British Royal Family from the Scottish line James I and VI who may have inherited it from his mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryOfScotland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryOfScotland">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. Mary, James and George are just the only reigning monarchs to suffer, all the other possible instances just cropped up in branch lines.
</li><li> Skeptics of the theory that George III inherited porphyria from either Mary and James have pointed out that that there is as yet no evidence of porphyria in the intervening generations of Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia; Sophia, Electress of Hanover; George I; George II; and Frederick, Prince of Wales. Certainly neither Mary nor James displayed any signs of madness. In any case, George III's doctors tried to cure his madness by giving him mercury ("It works on syphilis, maybe it'll cure this too..."), which obviously didn't help.
</li><li> Another doubt is cast on the porphyria idea is that one of its defining features is bluish urine... except George was also being given a herbal sedative which causes blueish urine as one of its known side-effects. There's also the curious fact that he 'got better' for a few years between two attacks of his madness; the descriptions allegedly make the first sound like a long hypermanic episode, and the second (when in his seventies) sound more like dementia than the 'madness' it was described as.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a> started out as a good king (kind of tough-minded and ambitious, but those were rated as virtues in a renaissance monarch), but became more and more cruel and egotistical as he got older (as many of his wives discovered). Theories differ on why, but illness, a sports-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">Career-Ending Injury</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">the lack of a backup male heir</a> have all been put forward as helping him along the path from arrogant and short-tempered to paranoid megalomaniac.
</li><li> The sanity of his daughter Queen Mary I (not only Britain's first undisputed queen regnant (ruling queen)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note98k2t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note98k2t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note98k2t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Queen Matilda's inheritance sparked a civil war that stopped her from being coronated, and only ended when her rival combatant died after making her son his heir, after which she abdicated.</span> but the original Bloody Mary) is a question historians have never settled. Her campaign to re-establish the Catholic church led to an unusually large number of brutal executions in her six-year reign and brought the country to the point of outright rebellion. Of course, the English Reformation had started as a way for her father to divorce and mistreat her mother, who was then dying of cancer, and witnessing that had a profound effect on Mary. She also may have had a hysterical pregnancy: when she married at 38 she was understandably desperate to produce an heir, as the only other surviving Tudor — her younger half-sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Elizabeth</a> — was of questionable legitimacy and very Protestant. Mary was observed by her courtiers to show every sign of pregnancy but a year went by and no child was born. For centuries it was assumed to be extreme wishful thinking. Evidence now suggests that she had ovarian cysts, or possibly uterine cancer. At any rate, having been in frail health since her teen years, she died of influenza.
</li></ul></li><li> The Habsburg dynasty of Austria, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, Spain, and various states in Northern Italy was excessively inbred even by the standards of late medieval European royalty, with a tendency towards mental instability as well as a distinctive underbite known as the "Habsburg lip" that got more disfiguring in later generations. The Habsburgs felt that not marrying "ruling houses" was beneath them and were also devout Catholics, meaning that a large part of German and European families were off limits after the Reformation, unless their partners were ready to convert.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10jma3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10jma3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10jma3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This for instance was the case with Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick, mother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">Maria Theresa</a>. </span> To make matters worse, after the Habsburgs split into an Austrian and a Spanish main line after Charles V/Carlos I, the two branches of the family kept trading marriage partners in order to continue to be able to inherit each other's throne should one of them die out. Marrying into the Spanish House of Trastamara in the early 16th century had been a shrewd political move to expand the family's power but a poor choice for genetic health as the pre-Reconquista Spanish houses were already pretty inbred. Even by that low bar, the Trastamaras were noted for their history of oddballs, although the number of truly crazy family members may have been overstated by their enemies.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCartoonHistoryOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCartoonHistoryOfTheUniverse">Larry Gonick's</a> take on the Trastamaras was "I'm Pedro El Cruel!

(The word in Old Spanish, <em>Iusteçero</em>, roughly translates to "Justiciar" and can mean "enforcer of justice" or "executioner", more or less.) The actual founder of the Trastamara line was Pedro's sane illegitimate half-brother but that didn't keep the unfortunate recessives from popping up in subsequent generations.
</li><li> Don Carlos, the rebellious son of Philip II, was insane to the point of being physically dangerous and would take swipes at passing servants with a knife.

Unsurprisingly, he closed the Habsburg chapter in Spain by not perpetuating his line (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">though his advisers tried to get an heir out of him</a>).

<ul><li> Also according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>, Charles was "short, lame, epileptic, senile and completely bald before 35, always on the verge of death but <strong>repeatedly baffling Christendom by continuing to live</strong>." Not much needs to be said after that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>All</em> Habsburg lines tended to lead back to "Juana la Loca", a.k.a. Queen Joanna the Mad of Aragon and Castille...over and over. It's debatable how mad she actually was and how much of that was genetic versus how much was induced by grief and mistreatment after the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyArrangedMarriage">her husband</a> Philip the Handsome, the Duke of Burgundy.

At first, the big tension was between Joanna's father Ferdinand (who was still King of Aragon and had gotten used to thinking of himself as king of his late wife's realm as well) and Philip, who resented his father-in-law's incessant interference in his and his wife's business. With Joanna's approval, Philip even had himself declared King of Castile <em>jure uxoris</em> (i.e. by right of marriage) to stop the meddling, but to his dismay it didn't, even though "husband" traditionally trumped "father" in the Control the Damsel game. Philip died soon after, leaving Joanna utterly distraught and disengaged from the business of governing. Ferdinand exploited this to the hilt until Joanna's son Carlos came of age, and he began fighting his grandpa for control of his mother's powers.</span> contested the incidents claimed as the most serious evidence of her insanity, such as repeatedly reopening her dead husband's casket. She probably did have some form of hereditary depression, but her purported "madness" was worst when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadwomanInTheAttic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadwomanInTheAttic">she was locked up in a nunnery</a> by her own father, Ferdinand, upon her political and military defeats after attempting to pry his claws off her throne after her husband's death — visitors (particularly outside witnesses) strongly discouraged. Her son, Carlos I/Charles V, later had to be told to treat his poor mother better <em>as a condition for election as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Emperor</a></em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12wtuu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12wtuu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12wtuu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yes, this is <em>that</em> Charles V.

The one who set up his son Philip with his cousin Mary to try and nab England for the family, too. That one.</span> Her deplorably neglectful living conditions were quite the open secret and scandal at the time.
<ul><li> Joanna was the older sister of Catherine of Aragon, first wife of Henry VIII. Her daughter Mary Tudor wedded her first cousin once removed Philip II, but they never produced a child and Philip eventually remarried with his niece Anne of Austria. Had the English Reformation never happened, the history of the Hapsburgs may have been quite different. On one hand, a Catholic England would have opened up the gene pool a bit for the Habsburgs. On the other hand, England still might not have provided enough genetic diversity if the Habsburgs kept marrying only Habsburgs (it would probably depend on whether the English Habsburgs continued the fine British tradition of having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">Spare to the Throne</a> inherit; the spare could then marry minor Italian and German Catholic nobles), and England might have suffered royal insanity to the same extent as the continent.

(This bit with James II confused his successor William of Orange, who could not understand why the English considered the claim of his future wife Mary, James' daughter by his commoner wife, stronger than William's, whose mother was James' older sister. William sidestepped this issue by marrying Mary and insisting they be crowned as joint monarchs.) Moreover, younger princes were encouraged to marry British noblewomen; oddly, younger British princes frequently ended up on the British throne.)</span> Moreover, because the Habsburgs regarded themselves as the guardians of Catholicism among the crowned heads of Europe, there was a strong (if unofficial) rule that the spouse of a Habsburg must be Catholic.

For an entertaining view on how insane things got, check out <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em>. How much of that was due to the Emperors being corrupted by absolute power, or due to environmental factors such as heavy metal poisoning (a sweeter wine is all well and good, but lead additives aren't going to be a health craze any time soon—and the the Romans were big fans of <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defrutum">defrutum<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, aka wine that has been boiled down into a thick sauce for use as a condiment, often produced in lead kettles), or how many Emperors just seemed paranoid and vicious because that was the only way to survive as a Roman Emperor (only 29 out of 88 Byzantine Emperors died of natural causes, and at least a dozen were murdered by their own relatives), or how much of the crazy was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">made up</a> by much later historians like Tacitus and Suetonius to serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">parables</a>, is both debatable and debated. The Empire alternated between periods of military autocracy (where the army essentially chose the leader) and dynasties founded by relatively competent emperors that inevitably descended into murder and madness within a couple generations. A sitting emperor's smartest option was usually to adopt an heir of proven sanity and military aptitude.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> was a hemophilia carrier and passed the gene on to three of her children, from whence it spread to many other European royal houses, royally screwing them over. This included the Romanovs, whose last legitimate heir was doomed to die from this illness before maturity; that's why the faith-healer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk">Rasputin the Mad Monk</a> gained such sway over the Empress. The hemophilia gene became so prevalent among royals that many commoners thought that hemophilia was <em>the</em> genetic marker of royalty. Even the 1950s B-movie <em>Queen of Blood</em> decided that the extraterrestrial featured must be royalty <em>solely because she was a hemophiliac</em>. That is one impressive little allele.

</li></ul></li><li> This led to the abolition of the 240-year-old Nepalese monarchy in 2008. In 2001, Crown Prince Dipendra allegedly went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and gunned down most of his relatives, including his parents the king and queen. By law, Dipendra was crowned Nepal's new king, despite being both accused of multiple murders and comatose from an allegedly self-inflicted gunshot wound. Dipendra quickly succumbed to his injuries and his uncle Gyanedra was crowned king despite being widely suspected of masterminding the royal family massacre. No matter whether Dipendra or Gyanedra had really done it, Nepal had made at least one mass murderer its king. When Gyanedra tried to abolish Parliament, the Nepalese decided they had had enough of this trope and voted to make peace with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists">Maoist rebels</a> and declare a republic.
</li><li> A reporter innocently asked Harald V of Norway (whose parents and paternal grandparents were first cousins, and his maternal grandparents were first cousins once removed) if a part of his desire to marry his wife (a Norwegian commoner) included expanding the family's gene pool. Harald's response?
<div class="indent"> Well, haven't you noticed that everyone in this family is a little weird?
</div></li><li> Ancient Egyptian pharaohs made something of a habit of marrying their eldest sisters, to the extent that archaeologists thought for awhile that claim to the throne might have passed through the oldest <em>daughter</em> of the late king because they couldn't understand why <em>else</em> so many princesses became their brothers' Great Royal Wives. Current theory says that it was in fact male-line inheritance and that many of the marriages were symbolic, meant to prevent princesses from marrying other men and establishing cadet branches of the royal family. HOWEVER the imperative to secure the bloodline (and a general Egyptian distaste for marrying non-Egyptians) meant that some of those sibling marriages were also <em>not</em> purely symbolic. The Ptolemaic dynasty (which was ethnically Greek but very quickly assimilated to pharonic tradition) in particular had a Moebius family tree and it kind of showed in some of the later Ptolemies, Berenices, and Cleopatras (historical accounts indicate that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII">Cleopatra VII</a>, the one everyone remembers, was unusually charming and savvy by her family's standards — a factoid which has been raising the odd eyebrow and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe">sparking betting pools</a> for centuries: genetic lottery win, a more distant Ptolemy than advertised, or outside contractor entirely?).
<ul><li> As the results, the Ancient Egyptian royal families were so biologically and ethically messed up that some archaeologists and historians argued they actually had it <strong>worse</strong> than the Habsburg family. The Ptolemaic royal family, for example, had many diseases attributed to them, with common descriptions of obesity, swollen necks and proptosis (bulging) eyes. They also carried a recessive trait that is similar to the Habsburg jaw. In terms of moral screw ups, some of the Ptolemaic pharaohs exhibited this:
<ul><li> Ptolemy VIII murdered his nephew to gain the throne, married the mother of that nephew, had an affair with his stepdaughter, and killed his son when the same mother proclaimed him the new Pharaoh. He was described by one Roman writer to having an unattractive face and a belly that is more of a "animal" than a man.
</li><li> Ptolemy XI who was forced to marry his stepmother and half-sister (also possibly her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">biological mother</a>) and murdered her nineteen days later after the marriage.
</li><li> Arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII">Cleopatra VII</a> could count, given all the backstabbing against her siblings (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">lifestyle in the court and the family</a> might also have contributed greatly to it).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tutankhamun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a> was the worse offender of this as he was revealed to contain multiple diseases including Köhler disease II that is very rare in the genetic link, and is likely be the factor to his death. He was also said to have large front incisors,a trait passed down from the Eighteenth Dynasty royal family (15431292 BC).
</li><li> In short, there are distinct chunks of Egyptian history where students and teachers alike kind of <em>hope</em> records are just plain wrong or somewhat too incomplete on. Or that, at the very least, sufficient amounts of discreetly hidden adultery/infidelity with non-kin was going on on the side at crucial junctures (looking at you specifically, you Ptolemaic lasses playing out your bacchanalian fantasies). Although it would have done very little for the detached culture at the top, at least, well... the slight possibility of <em>less</em> recursive genetic squick actually being in that cauldron of political intrigue and madness is a <em>comforting</em> thing to contemplate.

Their antics include releasing truly insane propaganda to the world which depicts their country as a wealthy and powerful developed nation (in fact their level of development ranges from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> era to downright medieval), claiming magical powers and impossible achievements (inventing the hamburger and communicating winning strategies to Olympic coaches through invisible phones are among the tamer ones), all but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">deifying themselves</a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_trim_our_hair_in_accordance_with_the_socialist_lifestyle">releasing a list of approved hairstyles for their subjects<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, threatening the use of nuclear weapons at the slightest provocation, abducting people worldwide for purposes ranging from creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> film to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">sexual slavery</a> to teaching English to spies, running a frightening amount of concentration camps which imprison whole families down to the third generation and generally treating their people like disposable chattel.
</li><li> The House of Saud, the rulers of Saudi Arabia. Leaving aside how they treat their own people, subjecting them to one of the harshest forms of Sharia law on Earth, with beheadings and crucifixions as common punishment, their personal behaviour often beggars belief, with accusations ranging from murder, rape, drug smuggling and mutilating a maid. As well as this, branches of the family are allegedly linked to terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIL, and most recently they've been accused of war crimes and attempted ethnic cleansing in Yemen. The somewhat peculiar line of succession that the house practiced for decades (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud">Ibn Saud</a>'s <em>many</em> sons <em>all</em> being placed before his grandsons) that all but guaranteed repeated brief reigns by elderly kings hasn't particularly lent itself to stability either. This last point seems to be changing, however. In 2015, the current king removed his younger half-brother (these two are the last of Ibn Saud's surviving sons) from the succession and replaced him with one of the grandsonswho wasn't anywhere close to being the oldest living male in that generation. And then in 2017, the king replaced that grandson with one of his own sons, who is literally young enough to be the son of the deposed crown prince.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22pcc6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note22pcc6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22pcc6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The deposed crown prince Muhammad bin Nayef was born in 1959; the incumbent, Mohammed bin Salman (aka MBS), was born in 1985.

Meanwhile, gushing profiles were written about the prince opening up theatres and cinemas for the first time in thirty five years, allowing women the right to drive, defanging the infamous "morality police", and his grand economic plans to move the country away from oil production... <br/>Then he had a critical journalist killed and dismembered by a fifteen man hit squad armed with a <em>bonesaw</em>, and people started to dig a bit deeper. As well as the earlier aforementioned not-quite controversies coming back into the spotlight, reports leaked that he was planning to invade and conquer Qatar until the US State Department found out, and it became apparent that his "reforms" were largely set dressing; for instance, while he allowed women to drive he had the female activists who fought for that right thrown in prison, and economists who called his signature "Vision 2030" plan to diversify the economy unrealistic were arrested on terrorism and treason charges.
</li></ul></li><li> Ibn Khaldun's surviving work deals specifically with North African bedouins, but he established a more generally applicable generational succession for nomads and the civilizations they conquer: the first generation is rough and tribal and not quite civilized, the second (with luck) still understands what made his father strong but also has been brought up in the arms of city culture, the third begins to lose touch and grow soft, and after that discipline just fall apart until the next new dynasty rides in and replaces them. Rinse, repeat. Ibn Khaldun was one of the first historians to have a theory of history instead of just a straightforward record of what happened. The Islamic dynasties of Spain are an excellent example of this paradigm and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveBecomeComplacent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveBecomeComplacent">We Have Become Complacent</a> on this very wiki is a relative of his theories. While he mostly gave North African examples, you have to bear in mind that the <em>Muqaddimah</em> (which is where these theories come from) was actually the <em>introduction</em> to a much larger history of North Africa and the Mediterranean (<em>muqaddimah</em> just means "introduction" in Arabic). With the possible exception of the Roman and Egyptian empires, pretty much every great empire of the Mediterranean region in the pre-modern era was founded by at best half-civilized conquerors who took over the established civilizations: the Akkadians, Assyrians, Hittites, Persians, Macedonians, Germans, Arabs, and Turks (to name only the most obvious examples) all did this. Even the Romans were pretty uncouth when they started taking over Italy; between their militarism, agrarianism, lack of high culture, and piety,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24nmfx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24nmfx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24nmfx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Rome was noted as the most pious city in Italy in that era</span> the perception the Etruscans and peninsular Greeks had of the Romans was the Classical Antiquity version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry">Flyover Country</a>. And as for the Egyptians, they only expanded to become a true empire after their country was conquered by foreign barbarians (the "Hyksos", who were probably Canaanite shepherds), and they won that empire by adopting the barbarians' technology and tactics.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LudwigIIOfBavaria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LudwigIIOfBavaria">Ludwig II of Bavaria</a> was considered by many to be mad, and deposed because of it (based on the "diagnosis" of Dr. Gudden, who wrote it without ever having met Ludwig in person), followed by his death the next day of either murder or suicide. For the most part his 'insanity' consisted of an obsession with building <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChittyChittyBangBang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChittyChittyBangBang">elaborate castles</a> (one of which became the model for Disney's trademark castle and the one in their parks), swans, opera music, and beautiful men, and he's more fondly remembered now — he's known as the <em>Fairytale King</em> or the <em>Swan King</em>. Aw.
<ul><li> After that, his brother and successor, King Otto, spent his entire "reign" institutionalised. (He'd already been declared mad and consigned to an asylum during Ludwig's reign.)
</li><li> Some Bavarians like to blame the madness of (possibly) Ludwig and (definitely) Otto on their Prussian mother Marie, pointing at the case of Frederick William IV (uncle of Marie of Bavaria), however new evidence suggests that the Frederick William did not actually go mad but suffered from the effects of a stroke in his later years, which his Bavarian consort Queen Elisabeth tried to hide from the public.

<ul><li> The text suggests he had severe migraine headaches, which can also make a person behave very irrationally and cause memory loss. He initially brought David to the palace because his doctors prescribed music to help him relax (1 Samuel 16:23) — this is when the spear-throwing started, as he came to realize that while David wasn't after the throne, he was destined to succeed him. His actions were savage, perhaps irrational, but not schizophrenic.

As a result, he was kept out of view of the public as much as possible.

</li><li> Countess Anna de Coligny (1624-80) was distantly related to the Kings of England and Prussia. She suffered from an illness. Her problems started young. She, while young, was reported to have tried to climb up the tapestries hanging from a wall after a seizure, and she did not get better. Four of her five daughters also went crazy (one had to be locked up in an apartment with <em>padded walls</em>). Her surviving son, while not insane, was very promiscuous and thought it would be a good idea for some of his illegitimate children to marry their half-siblings.
</li><li> Many Ottoman emperors have been known to fall into this, but not because of their genetics, but rather because of their upbringing. Whereas the traditional inheritance rule among them dictated that the most skilled son of the predecessor would inherit (read: the most ruthless one who was cool enough with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">simply murdering his (half-)brothers</a>), Sultan Ahmed I. decided instead to spare his younger brother Mustafa upon his ascension, and, in order to still isolate him from politics and potential rebels who might have wanted to use him in plots to overthrow the ruler, he simply locked the latter into the palace (and often only a small number of rooms, at that) in a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage">Gilded Cage</a> way for his entire life. This took an enormous emotional toll on the young prince, who upon Ahmed's death several years later, was rendered a psychological wreck, with severe neurosis and hallucinations. Although he followed his brother on the throne, he reigned for barely a year before the courtiers locked him up again (He later reigned a second time, again for barely a year). Ahmed's own sons who succeeded Mustafa, were also barely saner, with most of them proving to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger">Mood Swingers</a> with heavy paranoia: His first son Osman was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a> who used courtiers for target practice with his Longbow, his second son Murad a choleric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> who had almost all of his Viziers executed during his reign and a lot of Istanbul's population sent to the henchman for crimes like drinking coffee, and his last son Ibrahim was literally nicknamed "the mad" (but not for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, but rather because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">how many women he knocked up</a> (which was not all that bad a thing, too, because Murad had no children and slaughtered almost all of his (half-)brothers during his reign)). Most historicians today consider this one of the main reasons why the Ottoman Empire gradually collapsed.
</li><li> On the pathetic side, there is the Duke of Angoulême, son of Charles X of France. Unlike his father and his more charismatic brother, the Duke of Berry, he was frail, suffering from many nervous tics and probably impotent, which at least prevented him from having even more screwed-up offspring with his wife and first cousin, Marie-Thérèse, daughter of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. He did ascend the French throne during the July Revolution... for all of 20 minutes, and even then most Legitimist partisans refused to acknowledge his claim to the throne.
</li><li> As mentioned, several Chinese emperors and other Chinese royals, nobles, and worthies succumbed to "immortality elixirs" containing mercury. Practically every Chinese dynasty has at least one monarch who trusted the peddlers of immortality potions too much, and got a nasty case of quicksilver poisoning for his trouble. Some highlights:
<ul><li> The first emperor recorded to have gone cuckoo-bird after too much "immortality elixir" was the <em>first</em> emperor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShihuangdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QinShihuangdi">Qin Shi Huangdi</a>, who started off a suspicious but fundamentally sound monarch but ended up completely paranoid after years of "treatment" with mercury-containing "medicine." He was also the first emperor to die from it after he took pills containing <em>pure mercury</em> in 220 BCE. These killed him by (surprise, surprise) acute mercury poisoning. Again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">he did this as a step to achieving eternal life</a>.
</li><li> You would think killing the first emperor would put the alchemists off mercury. You would be wrong. They blamed Qin Shihuangdi's death on his taking <em>pure</em> mercury, rather than mercury compounds "specially treated" with fire or some such, and with that "explanation", they were able to just keep concocting new mercury-containing potions, hand-waving away the obvious ill effects—for (as mentioned) <em>almost two thousand years</em>.
<ul><li> Over a <em>thousand</em> years after the death of Qin Shihuang, a doctor told Emperor Xuānzong of Tang (reigned 846-859 CE, and generally considered to be the last good Tang emperor) that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideEffectsInclude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideEffectsInclude">litany of ill effects he was suffering</a>—all of which modern medicine recognizes as symptoms of acute mercury poisoning—were signs that the medicine was working. Xuānzong also died of too much "immortality elixir" after (again) going from a suspicious but capable monarch to a paranoid wreck over the course of several years of treatment. He did manage to avoid the acute mercury poisoning that offed Qin Shihuang, but the chronic poisoning that got him was arguably worse.
</li><li> And they kept coming. While the later dynasties tended to be more cautious about mercury (the Ming even technically had a rule against elixirs), the only dynasty that appears to have been completely unaffected is the Yuan (which is to say, the Mongol dynasty of Kublai Khan), which tended to look down on Chinese alchemy in general when it wasn't making gunpowder.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26g9fg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note26g9fg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26g9fg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which itself had been invented by different Chinese alchemists looking for an elixir of life; however, since eating gunpowder will at worst give you a stomachache, it doesn't fit into the "mad royals" trope.</span> The last emperor to die of alchemical elixir poisoning, the Yongzheng Emperor of Qing, died in 1735—just under 900 years after Xuānzong. Like both Qin Shihuang and Xuānzong, he was noted as an effective and ruthless ruler before taking the elixir; unlike them, he appears to have taken a lethal dose before the effects of chronic usage could catch up to him, and is widely remembered as a good (if despotic) ruler (with an assist from the stellar reputations of his father, the Kangxi Emperor, and his son, the Qianlong Emperor).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Oldenburg dynasty in Denmark, beginning with Christian I, deserves some notes here. Most of the kings were fairly sensible at best, and dimwitted at worst, known to screw up badly in foreign affairs. Then <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_VII_of_Denmark">Christian VII<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> came along. He suffered from mental illness, and had to rule by proxy for long periods of time. Christian suffered from hallucinations and paranoia, and his reign coincided with that of English George III (mentally ill kings were somewhat fashionable at this time). His illness led to the infamous <em>Struensee affair</em>, when the King´s physician took the helm in his name and turned out to be the most sensible ruler Denmark had had for decades, until he was toppled in a coup and executed. His son, Frederick VI, had to rule in his name from that point and onwards, and is known for having messed up big time when he eventually became king. This because he was the unlucky bastard who had to steer Denmark through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a>, and screwed up enough to be partly responsible for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorwegianConstituentAssembly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorwegianConstituentAssembly">Norwegian Constituent Assembly</a>. The dynasty died out with Frederick VII, and the Glüksborg branch turned out to be a <em>lot</em> more sensible, but then they were <em>constitutional</em> monarchs.
</li><li> The Wasa ruling family of Sweden deserves a little mention, for all they never quite managed, say, Ottoman, Russian or Austrian levels of screwed-upness. Wallflowers afraid of a little bloodshed they generally weren't, though. However, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_XIV_of_Sweden">Eric XIV<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is their poster boy for this trope. He started out fairly OK; his early (and bloody) crack-downs smacked of efficient brutality to get the job of consolidating power under the Crown's control done at a time when Sweden's nobles were quite prone to factionalism. Buuuuuuuuuut... these little showers of terror mounted up, came at quicker and quicker intervals, involved more people and started targeting those who only <em>might</em> have been scheming, maybe (probably not). The Sture murders were the last straw, and what would today would be considered a successful coup ousted him from the throne. He later died of conveniently well-timed mysterious circumstances in prison. When his body was exhumed centuries later, it turned out his bones were loaded with arsenic. Fun fact: pea soup is a Scandinavian staple of both commoner and noble alike. Another fun fact, green dyes often are based on a mix of cobalt and <em>arsenic</em> compounds. C16th Sweden not only had plenty of people willing to murder the guy, but it also was gaining the fashionable habit of adding extra colouring to food, especially that served to nobles. So, sure; quite possibly murder. And/or... decades of heavy metal poisoning (and increasingly erratic behaviour) because of regularly enjoying brilliantly green split-pea soup.
</li><li> Korea's royals weren't immune to this. The ruling dynasties weren't as consistently insane as, say, the Hapsburgs, but there was always at least one bad apple in each dynasty.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunghye_of_Goryeo">King Chunghye<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo">Goryeo dynasty<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was infamous for his habit of abducting, raping, and murdering women. This made him very unpopular with everyone and ultimately caused his downfall. He raped at least two of his late father's concubines. One of them, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Gyeonghwa">Bayankhutag<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, was a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty">Yuan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> noblewoman. After Chunghye raped her the Yuan emissary arrested Chunghye and dragged him to Beijing, where he spent the rest of his life as a prisoner.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongmin_of_Goryeo">King Gongmin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Chunghye's half-brother, was every bit as screwed-up. He came to the throne by having Chunghye's fourteen-year-old son deposed and poisoned. During his reign he raped five underage boys (that we know of; those are only the ones whose names are recorded). He finally died after he discovered one of his concubines was having an affair with another man. Afraid of being executed, the concubine's lover murdered Gongmin in his sleep.
</li><li> The insanity didn't end with the Goryeo dynasty. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YeonsangunOfJoseon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YeonsangunOfJoseon">Yeonsan-gun of Joseon</a> had the dubious honour of being the worst tyrant in all of Korean history until the Kims of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a> came along. When he first took the throne he seemed competent and mentally stable. That quickly changed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas">Yeonsan had an obsession with restoring his late mother's reputation.</a> Unfortunately that made him launch two purges of the scholars who had even the most tenuous connection — or <em>no connection at all</em> — to his mother being deposed and executed. He went as far as punishing officials who weren't even in the palace when his mother died; his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">"reasoning"</a> appears to have been "they did nothing to stop it, so they're responsible!". Two of his father's concubines were most responsible for his mother's execution, so he beat them to death. He fatally injured his grandmother during an argument and murdered an official who confronted him about his behaviour. As if all that isn't bad enough, he later had people driven from their houses to build his hunting grounds, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">exiled a minister for spilling a drink</a>, and kidnapped a thousand women and turned a former university into his personal brothel. His people finally had enough, staged a coup, and overthrew him. It's no coincidence that even though he reigned as king, he's remembered only as "Prince Yeonsan" (the literal translation of "Yeonsan-gun") and not as "King Yeonsan" (which would be "Yeonsan-wang").
</li><li> Two hundred years later <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prince_Sado">Crown Prince Sado<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> came along. He and his father King Yeongjo had a, shall we say, <em>difficult</em> relationship. Yeongjo was never happy with anything Sado did and went out of his way to publically humiliate him. On top of this Sado was mentally ill, suffered from hallucinations, and had a bizarre phobia of clothes. Over time his mental state deteriorated and he became violent. In 1757 he beheaded a eunuch and carried the severed head around with him. Things went from bad to worse after that. He started killing palace servants and raping ladies-in-waiting, became abusive towards his wife and threatened to kill his sister, and beat his concubine to death. In 1762 Yeongjo ordered Sado to climb into a rice chest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">The prince was locked inside and left to starve to death.</a>
