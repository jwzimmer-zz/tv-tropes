</div></div><p>Shadow Archetype has to do with two elements of writing: characters and settings, and also the most feared archetype, even to heroes. In this article we discuss character archetypes. For the settings viewpoint, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shadowland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shadowland">Shadowland</a>.
</p><p>Character-wise, it's the part of the personality that embodies everything a character, called the 'Self', doesn't like about themselves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask">the things they (often subconsciously) deny about themselves</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalProjection">project on to others</a>. In fact, the more the Shadow has been repressed, the more powerful it becomes. To show these things to the audience we need an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">embodiment</a> of some sort.

</li></ul></li></ul><p>Those tropes have examples listed of characters playing those more-precise Shadow roles that often overlap with this but do not have to.
</p><p>A common trope involves the Self accepting their Shadow, metaphorically coming to terms with their flaw (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmWhatIAm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmWhatIAm">I Am What I Am</a>). That is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> refuses to kill the Shadow, given the opportunity, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword">outright refuses to fight it</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Crane Hermit is a shadow of Master Roshi. He represents what Roshi would be like if he became corrupted.
</li><li> Before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, Tien represents what Goku would be like if he allowed his arrogance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">natural talent</a> for fighting to go to his head. This also highlights the difference between the Turtle and the Crane Schools. Master Roshi went out of his way to teach his students humility and that there was always someone better. The Crane Hermit bloated his students' egos, telling them that there was no one stronger than them.
</li><li> King Piccolo is a shadow archetype to Goku. Given their similar backstories, Piccolo is what Goku would have become if he embraced his ruthless Saiyan nature.
</li><li> Turles. In fact, Turles was originally supposed to be the result of what Goku would have been like if he hadn't lost his memory.
</li><li> After character development, Frieza to Vegeta. Frieza is everything Vegeta would have become if he succeeded in taking his place as ruler of the universe instead of settling down on Earth.
</li><li> Cell serves as this to different characters in his evolutionary line:
<ul><li> In his Imperfect form, he represents what Piccolo would be like if he never met Gohan and became friend.
</li><li> In his Semi-Perfect form, he is Vegeta if he never settled down on Earth and became completely ruled by his pride and arrogance.
</li><li> In his Perfect form, he is what Goku would be like if he chose only to live for fighting and used his natural talent to terrorize people instead of protecting them.
</li><li> When he reaches his Super Perfect form, he is Gohan if he embraced the rage of a Super Saiyan and becomes an uncaring monster who only lives to destroy.
</li></ul></li><li> Majin Buu to Goku. If Goku lived only to eat, satisfying his need for battle, and cared for no one outside of himself, he would be similar to Buu.
</li><li> Beerus is what Goku would be like if he didn't have anyone around to act as his moral compass.
</li><li> Goku Black. With all of Goku's power at his disponsal and none of his purity and kind-heartedness, Black is living proof of just how terrifying and unstoppable Goku would be as a villain.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, it's heavily implied that Vicious is what Spike would've turned into without Julia's influence (and vice-versa).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> being a complex psychological piece has plenty of examples, namely: Utena/Mikage (the name is a clue); Nanami/Utena; Akio/Dios; Akio/Utena; Anthy/Nanami. Also, the elevator in the Black Rose arc is all about getting in touch with one's shadow. All the Black Rose duelists become Black Rose duelists by entering the elevator and confessing something, usually that they secretly hate some other character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em> is ultimately about what happens when someone's Shadow Archetype gets out and starts breaking everyone else's shadows free.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, it becomes clear that this is the case with Eren Yeager and Reiner Braun. Both are Eldrians that are raised with what they learn to be falsified history and lose their innocent view of the world at a young age, resulting in them becoming driven with their goals and growing more cynic. However, Reiner was the heroic leader that was a protective big brother to everyone, when he really was one of the Titans that attacked the city in the beginning and was fighting for a hostile country, intending to kill everyone living in Paradis. Eren was rather misfit and mostly shone through his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">determined</a> attitude, who turned out to be a Titan himself, but was using it to keep the people in Paradis safe from others. <br/>This gets thrown on its head post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, as Eren becomes more morally corrupt and even admits that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">he and Reiner are very much the same</a>, and Reiner shows that he has become guilt-ridden from his previous actions and genuinely wants to do better now. They are displayed like the same character, but viewed from 'the other end' of the war. And <em>then</em> it becomes more ambiguous which one of them is the other's Shadow, due to the growing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grey-and-Gray Morality</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun">Trigun</a></em>
<ul><li> Vash's brother Knives, instead of having an extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">aversion to killing</a>, sees humans as pathetic and inferior, and has no compunction about killing them for any or no reason. Knives has serious self-control issues which occasionally cause him difficulties and turn out to have shortened his lifespan, while Vash being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">The Fettered</a> is... ubiquitous. His twin isn't just everything-bad-that-he-isn't, he's everything Vash <em>refuses</em> to be. Even more in the manga, where Vash almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">flipped out</a> the same time Knives did, and had a suicide attempt and accidentally almost killed Rem, which was met with maniacal laughter, and then he pulled himself together and <em>chose</em> to not give up on people.
</li><li> Wolfwood is Vash's <em>foil</em>, though Vash may be viewed as the idealism-shadow of either Knives or Wolfwood, who wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses">Jade-Colored Glasses</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>
<ul><li> Gendou gives a good idea of how disillusioned, cynical and bitter Shinji could grow up to become. It's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NeonGenesisEvangelionAngelicDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NeonGenesisEvangelionAngelicDays">Angelic Days</a></em> manga, which shows Gendou as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Troubled, but Cute</a> (in Yui's eyes!) "nobody loves me so I hate everybody!" teen.
</li><li> The actual shadow archetype from Jungian psychology shows up, as a shadowy Shinji on a train that reveals truths Shinji doesn't want to face. However, since Shinji frequently suffers from negative opinions of himself he rather likes his shadow and feels it to be much better than he is.

Both are subservient to others, but Lux helps out anyone who asks while Yoruka devotes herself to a single master at a time. They have near-identical fighting styles, having invented the same techniques independently, but Yoruka's is naturally more lethal. Finally, they both have younger siblings of the opposite sex who can't fight, but Yoruka's brother was killed prior to the start of the series.

</li><li> The Dawnbreaker represents Batman's fear of how dangerous he would be with superpowers but lacking his adult discipline, his inner despair taken to its extreme, and his inability to get over his parent's deaths.
</li><li> The Devastator is a Batman giving into despair, not recognizing how important his friendship with Superman is, and both the fear and regret that he can't fully trust the Man of Steel anymore.

</li><li> The Red Death represents Batman's fear of losing members of the Bat-family, how his love for them has clouded his judgement, and regret for those he failed. Some of his dialogue and his Speed Force quirk imply he might also represent Batman's fear of old age slowing him down.

However, what worsens and complicates matters is that Gideon tampered with Scott's memories, thus making Nega-Scott's nature even more dubious. In fact, given its appearance when Scott began going out with Ramona and the mechanics of The Glow (the psychological weapon Gideon made that traps you in your own head and brings out your worse tendencies), it's possible that <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegaScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegaScott">Nega Scott</a> didn't truly exist until Gideon messed with Scott's mind in the first place.

Jeopardizing the public to spend more time with loved ones, winning public support by being unnecessarily brutal with criminals (even terrorizing JJJ for good publicity), forcing the symbiote to stay bonded with him despite its own wishes... it all comes back to bite him, though.
</li><li> The Scorpion parallels Spider-Man's arachnid-based powers and costume, though he is quite different from Spider-Man in personality, being a crazed villain.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NormanOsborn">The Green Goblin</a> parallels Spider-Man's Halloweenish or creepy style (even going so far as to throw exploding jack-o-lanterns!), has similar strength and agility, and shares Peter's sense of humor and love of adventure.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a> has many of Peter's powers, sense of humor, and represents what he would have become if he hadn't had the will to resist the symbiote. Even after his transition into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, Venom is still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Sociopathic Hero</a> who more or less represents what Spider-Man could have been if he were fully willing to kill.

While bearing the same power set, Kaine is first an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>, then a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero">Nominal Hero</a>, and finally an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> who claims to pride himself on having all of the power but <em>none</em> of the responsibility that comes with it. Of course, those damned Parker genes won't let him abdicate that responsibility, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">he later claims it outright, telling an insane Ben Reilly that Reilly doesn't deserve to be the Scarlet Spider any more</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Baron Mordo to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a>, who represents what Strange might have become if he hadn't learned humility, patience, and respect for others. <em>Doctor Strange: The Oath</em> introduces Nicodemus West, yet another student of the Ancient One, with the added resonance of also being a physician.
</li><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>'s archenemies are dark reflections of himself:
<ul><li> General Zod is Superman with a sense of personal entitlement instead of charity. Zod also serves as an example of what Superman could become, if he gives in to self-righteousness.
</li><li> Mr. Mxyzptlk is an "alien" who is "careful" with his immense power but still uses it frivolously instead of responsibly.
</li><li> Metallo is a "Man of Steel" whose powers came at the cost of his humanity, in contrast to Clark's powers which enhance his humanity. He's also an example of what a Superman weaponized by the U.S. military might look like.
</li><li> Doomsday is all the power harnessed for destruction instead of protection.

</li><li> While not created as a Superman villain, Lobo has been used as Superman's shadow as well: both are comparably powerful, both are the survivors of a dead race (Lobo killed his race while Superman's was dead before he was old enough to know them) but Lobo does whatever he wants and leaves a path of destruction behind him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> sees Superman as his <em>own</em> Shadow Archetype: Lex sees himself as someone who's worked and struggled for everything he has who represents the best humanity has to offer, and he sees Superman as someone who never had to earn his powers who sets himself above humanity and lords it over us. Furthermore Superman uses power for the good of mankind, while Lex would use his fortune and influence just to show how powerful he is. Superman grew up with a loving family, while Lex's were abusive and were killed (possibly by him).
<ul><li> Furthermore both Lex and Superman believe in humanity's ability for self-improvement and ability to achieve greatness. However Superman believes humanity should put those traits to use for the betterment of all, while Lex holds that humanity should seek to secure its own interests and power above all.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> is what Superman would be if he decided to use his powers to be a God ruling over everyone.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> could be seen as a heroic example of this. Both Clark and J'onn are powerful, benevolent aliens who are the last of their kinds. The difference being that Superman was raised on Earth and considers himself an Earthling for the most part, while J'onn is Martian through and through. Superman is a friendly, handsome white guy; J'onn is a bald, crimson-eyed, stoic green man (though his human guise is that of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldBlackLeaderGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldBlackLeaderGuy">Bald, Black Leader Guy</a>). Superman's powers (super strength, flight, super senses) are the stuff of Greek legends; Manhunter's powers (telepathy, Shapeshifting, invisibility) are the stuff people feared about aliens during the 50's.
</li><li> Bizarro is Superman lacking his sense of justice and cannot tell right from wrong, often reveling in destruction for its own sake. He is also an imperfect copy of Superman created by science gone awry.
</li><li> Mongul I, another alien despot who enjoys watching others fight and die for his sadistic amusement, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">feels that the universe owes him its fealty,</a> and runs every planet he rules into the ground with his limitless ambition and cruelty.
</li><li> As with Metallo, Cyborg Superman's powers came at the cost of losing his sanity, causing him to irrationally blame Superman for his misfortunes.
</li><li> Ultraman of Earth-3 is what happens when absolute power is given to a small-minded, petty jerk, and demonstrates why Earth-1/the Matter universe is so lucky to get the Superman that it did.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InjusticeGodsAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InjusticeGodsAmongUs">Regime Superman</a> is an alternate Superman who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">snapped</a> because of a tragic event, lost any semblance of morality, and established a dictatorial regime. Regime Superman even irrationally blames others for the tregedies he suffered.
</li><li> Born on a parallel world that was devoid of any superheroes or even superhumans, and was destroyed during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em>, Superboy-Prime was trapped outside time for decades. Unlike mainstream Superman, his faith in Earth-1's heroes was destroyed by decades of their mistakes, and he emerged from a pocket dimension to try to replace Superman. Prime firmly believes that being Superman is his calling despite the fact that he has become a psychotic and murderous villain.
</li><li> The Ultra-Humanite is the first supervillain ever faced by Superman and one of the first of the Golden Age of Comics. He was designed to be the polar opposite of the Man of Steel: while Superman is a hero with superhuman strength, the Ultra-Humanite is a criminal mastermind who has a crippled body but a highly advanced intellect.

Both came from being traumatically removed from home into unfamiliar surroundings, with two very different upbringings. Starfire's perceptions of humanity, along with her tendency to attempt to kill whatever she doesn't like directly contrast Clark's. Star wishes to remain very private, only presenting herself willingly to the public eye when it's unavoidable.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> has a few of these as well:
<ul><li> Like Diana, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cheetah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cheetah">Cheetah</a> is a divinely-empowered woman. But whereas Diana's powers are a gift from the deities she worshipped, Cheetah's powers come with a curse that makes her the slave of an abusive god. Diana is also a beautiful woman while Cheetah is a cat person (though how monstrous Cheetah looks depends on the artist).
</li><li> Circe's cynical and hateful attitude towards humans (men in particular) is played in deliberate contrast to Diana's more compassionate and optimistic view. Really exemplified after Circe briefly stole Diana's powers and became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> to Wonder Woman.In her first Post-Crisis story, she herself pointed this out. Much like Diana, Circe was to fulfill a mission from the gods - namely, Hecate, who wished to punish humanity for her mistreatment, which Circe did by driving divides between men and women further. She later invokes their similarities again when she explains how both she and Diana are powerful women who are outsiders feared by humans because the causes they fight are hidden beneath blood shed by their hands (Circe fought and killed to get her daughter back, while Diana fought and killed others like Maxwell Lord to protect her friends and herself).
</li><li> While not a villain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Artemis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Artemis">Artemis</a> of the Bana-Mighdall is a shadow archetype to Diana as well. Both are the champions of their respective Amazon tribes and are named after a hunting goddess. But whereas Diana is friendly, warm and humble, Artemis is rude, brash and arrogant (though she does have a hidden heart of gold).
</li><li> Devastation is a creature created by deities just like Diana (in Devastation's case, the Titans of Myth).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Donna Troy</a> ultimately gained her own shadow archetype in the form of Dark Angel, an evil version of Donna from another universe.
</li><li> Heracles could be considered a shadow archetype to Cassie Sandsmark. Both are demigod offsprings of Zeus but while Cassie is Diana's friend, Heracles is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">often her enemy</a>.
</li><li> During the Golden Age, Gundra the Valkyrie served this role to Wonder Woman. Both come from mythological races of warrior women but while Diana fought for the Allies, Gundra fought for the Axis powers.
</li><li> Given that she is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Lex Luthor, Veronica Cale also serves as this to Diana. Where Diana is a princess born to a (relative) utopia, Cale was the illegitimate child of a stripper and a married man. Diana is a being blessed with godly powers while Cale had to scrape and scramble in order to get to the top. Both are viewed as feminist icons in universe but Cale feels she is more entitled to that position than Diana.
</li><li> Doctor Psycho is a dark reflection of Diana's love with his obsession.
</li></ul></li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WonderWomanVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WonderWomanVillains">LeTonya Charles/Cyborgirl</a> is a foe of Wonder Woman, she's established as an evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg">Cyborg</a>. Like Victor Stone, who was cyborgized following a horrific accident, Cyborgirl damaged her own body, but was saved by one of the scientists who repaired Victor. But unlike Cyborg, who used his newfound gifts as a Teen Titan and a member of the Justice League, LeTonya is a drug addict who deliberately damaged her own body and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection">used her cybernetics</a> to focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">personal gain</a>. Her life is just a haphazard mudslide over which she has relatively little control due to her own failures, and choosing to destroy her body with Tar is what led her to become a cyborg. For all intents and purposes, she's an insane psychopath even after being robotized.

Both are brilliant and utterly ruthless Pureblood spymasters from old families, who grew up in lives of privilege and embraced Voldemort's ideals. Both ultimately disdained those ideals, forging their own paths, merging magical power with muggle organisation and know-how, dismissing the Ministry as incompetent and unfit for purpose, looking to reshape the world they grew up in. Both fulfil every single criteria to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>. Both are borderline sociopathic, with their only apparent genuine love being for their immediate family. And both seek power.

</li><li> Steve Rogers has two: the Winter Soldier and Baron Zemo. The former Steve worries is essentially him when you take away everything human and leave behind only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> (the story hints that he's not far wrong, either), while the latter is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> explicitly described by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> as 'the Anti-Cap', being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">The Strategist</a> for HYDRA, a master combatant on the battlefield, and entirely loyal to the dream of HYDRA, while being more than willing to facilitate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a> if a specific leader is deemed unsuitable, in contrast to Steve's strategic leadership on the battlefield and loyalty to America as an idea.
</li><li> Gravemoss qualifies as this to Loki: a master sorcerer, born different to everyone around him, and occasionally shunned because of it, who delved into darkness and madness, seeking the power he deemed his due, surrounding himself with those he could control... you could be discussing either of them. Of course, even in his madness, Loki <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">had his limits</a> and did love people, as well as displaying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValour">Villainous Valour</a> and eventually turning back from the darkness.

</li><li> Harry has one in Voldemort, as per canon, though with a few twists: both are half-bloods, who grew up in miserable circumstances, and whose fathers weren't quite as dead as was generally believed, who are especially influenced by their mothers even from beyond the grave, and cleave particularly strongly to that side of the family while very closely resembling their fathers, who have become incredibly powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman">Ambiguously Human</a> beings that may not actually be able to die (with Harry, it's not down to some inherent quality so much as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the protection of the Phoenix</span>), wielding vast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> (though Voldemort's were stolen) and magic. Harry is also often stated as, if he gave into his dark side, being capable of being much like Magneto at his worst - which, in turn, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> to Voldemort. However, the difference is that while Voldemort uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> as a standard tactic, for Harry it's a last resort, one that absolutely horrifies him. Equally, Voldemort surrounds himself with puppets and sees himself as superior, while Harry plays down his background and any basis for superiority, actively seeking the company of those not dazzled by his already growing legend.

Yet although Anna tries to caution her sister about that particular danger, she is still able to realize that it is not the magic itself that is the problem and to let her love guide her instead of her fear. She still supports Elsa and sees the beauty in it when others don't, even Elsa herself, and is even the one to show her sister how to embrace her power.

<ul><li> He represents what Po could have been with a bad teacher. Notice one of his first lines (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a>) is similar, if less funny, to Po's first line. Also both of them are incurable show-offs, even when the situation calls for dead seriousness. When Tai Lung appeared before Shifu out of nowhere before their confrontation, he was hiding at a distance for some time and waiting for Shifu to blink, so that his entrance could be appropriately dramatic (as explained in DVD commentary).
</li><li> He is also one to Tigress, due to their similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">The Resenter</a> role for not being chosen as the Dragon Warrior. However while Tigress' honour code and loyalty to Shifu still offset that slight, Tai Lung's sense of entitlement made him betray his masters.
</li></ul></li><li> Lord Shen serves as one to both Po and Master Shifu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda2">Kung Fu Panda 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> With Po, both have parental abandonment issues and are real animals likened to mythical beasts (Po the Panda is the Dragon Warrior, while Shen the peacock is clearly meant to be a phoenix with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">passion for fire</a>). Both are nervous and unsure of themselves, having many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedAttemptAtDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedAttemptAtDrama">Failed Attempt at Drama</a> moment. Both are black-and-white animals who are (apparently) the last of their kind, and both fight using unconventional methods. They achieved their places of power by using fireworks and by defeating highly skilled masters (Tai Lung and the Masters' Council) who stood in their way. Both their destinies were set in motion when the Soothsayer predicted their eventual conflict, and both sought inner peace to deal with their tragic pasts. Shen represents what Po could have been had he kept on to old grudges and refused to move on from the past.
</li><li> Shen is Master Shifu's villainous foil. They both had a clairvoyant elder who watched their development (the Soothsayer and Master Oogway) and who foretold a disaster (Shen's demise and Tai Lung's return). Both proteges then try to avert said disaster, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">only to inadvertently cause it to happen</a>. Like with Shifu in the first movie, Shen's present is influenced by the pains of the past, making him demanding and biased, with his high expectations in regards to his subordinates mirroring those of Shifu with his students. In particular, neither of them believe initially that someone like Po could be a mighty warrior, only for the determined panda to defy their expectations. Their main difference is in regards to the advice offered to them by their mentors; Shifu doesn't want Oogway to leave and afterward respects his master's wish to train Po despite his doubts, but Shen eventually sends the Soothsayer away when he decides he can't find happiness from her advice. Shifu ultimately finds inner peace by listening to Oogway while Shen can find peace only in death through his own self-destructive decisions.

</li><li> Tywin notes a similarity between a young Cersei and Arya in their spirited and rebellious natures. However, Cersei was forced by Tywin to conform to the standard submissive role for a Westerosi woman, and put her energy into becoming an evil queen.
</li><li> Both Tyrell women, Margaery and Olenna, share many traits with Cersei  they're manipulative, willing to use seduction (in Olenna's case, in the past) to further their goals and were "blessed" with not particularly politically competent husbands. Olenna and Cersei also share ruthlessness and and similarities in their acts go as far as committing a regicide and letting an innocent man take the fall. However, by growing (at least in Margaery's case) in a household where the female role was valued and taught  instead of being reduced to a property of a man and a piece to haggle  and being <em>sane</em>, they get out of their roles everything Cersei couldn't: Margaery is a popular queen and gets to manipulate even Joffrey, and Olenna is the real head of her family who has raised a capable heiress and is the closest thing the series has to a female Tywin.

</li><li> The Borg are shadows to humanity, being uniform and collectivist versus human individualism and self-determination. They also share several traits with humans, such as adaptability and desire for self-improvement, all of which they can do MUCH faster. They explore space searching for other forms of life, but while the humans of Star Trek wish to meet with other species peacefully to learn about them, the Borg learn by conquering and assimilating other life. Another parallel is mentioned by Eddington in Deep Space Nine, pointing out how the Borg state their plans for assimilation, while humans slowly manipulate races into joining the Federation.
</li><li> The Dominion are shadows to the Federation - they are a large galactic alliance that professes the ideals of peace, co-operation, freedom and self-determination, yet do not truly practice them and are extremely aggressive in war. The Dominion is what the Federation would become if humanity became hypocritical to the point where they only paid lip service to those ideals.

Some characters manage to be their own shadows: Angel, Willow, Oz, Spike, and (in one episode) Xander. Willow's shadow, the vampire from the Wish Dimension, gets extra points - not just dangerous and creepy, but also showing signs of Willow's latent sexuality. Jonathan is what Xander might have become if he'd made a few wrong turns.

<ul><li> The main representatives for the factions also count. Grandmaster Satele on the Republic side is, at first appearance, an ideal Jedi. However, her being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">descended from Bastila Shan and Revan</a>, who both had nasty falls to the Dark Side put her under a lot of scrutiny.

Nadia is a powerful, but untrained Force wielder who needs to learn how to control her powers and emotions. Ashara is equally talented, but has been trained as a Jedi all her life and her arc is in accepting her passions. Xalak and Zenith aren't quite as matched, but they're both the bloodthirsty type; Zenith approving of destroying Imperials and collaborators (and civilian casualties are no big deal) as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Cold Sniper</a> and Xalek being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> who sees the Sith as living gods.

These Shadows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">follow the Jungian archetype</a> and represent whatever the characters may have repressed. They will loudly exclaim these repressed feelings to the world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">and do not take kindly to being denied</a>. Accepting and embracing the flaws the shadow archetypes represent is how the party members obtain their persona, another call-out to Jung.
</li><li> A more mundane example of the trope is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the real killer, Tohru Adachi</span>, who is a counterpart to both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yosuke Hanamura</span>.

With regards to you, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both you and Adachi are both relatively recent arrivals who received their powers from the same goddess (Adachi's own persona is basically a palette swap of your starting persona), but only you use it for good.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> plays with this. The main bosses are the Shadows of the various corrupt individuals you're trying to defeat, and represent the purest form of their distorted ways of thinking. The real people would almost certainly deny what their Shadows say about them, not out of any repression or guilt, but to protect themselves from the repercussions of their evil actions being discovered. And then there's the fourth target, whose Shadow stands as completely unique in this series: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shadow Futaba is a golden Shadow, meaning that she represents repressed <em>positive</em> traits and desires. In this case, the desire to live and be loved. Consequently, she's a very helpful Shadow who wants her real self to accept her so that she can recover from her mental illness.</span>

If this sounds overly similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em>, that's because both were created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atlus">Atlus</a>.

Specifically, Shadow is what Sonic would be if he was willing to go through some extremes to get the job done.
<ul><li> Shadow himself got his own Shadow Archetype, Mephiles, who was created from his actual shadow (take a few seconds to process that). Both were created in human laboratories and have had horrible mistreatment from humans (G.U.N. trying to shutdown Project Shadow and killing Maria, while the Solarian scientists performed experiments to use Solaris for their own game). They also have large egos and manipulated others (Eggman and Silver) to get what they want. While Shadow decided to leave behind his desire for revenge on the human race, Mephiles embraces it with a touch of sadism and wants to destroy every living thing.

Saucerors, who allow The Sauce to flow through them, fight a blob formed from the various bits and pieces rejected by the Sauce until it became sentient. Accordion Thieves fight an angry mariachi, and Disco Bandits fight the Spirit of New Wave, the genre which killed Disco. In mid-2009 brief encounters with the Nemesis became possible, and as of early 2010 it's possible to complete the full side-quest against the Nemesis, complete with a secret <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IslandBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IslandBase">Island Base</a> (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano">volcano</a>!) and the Nemesis possessing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form.

<ul><li> Byakuren Hijiri is a devout Buddhist nun. Despite having quite the rap sheet of transgressions in her past, most notably using sorcery to make herself immortal in staunch defiance of Buddhist principles and willingly consorting - even empathizing - with youkai and demons, she strives to be one of the nicest people in the setting and one of the strongest proponents for peaceful coexistence. Contrasting her, Seiga Kaku is a heretical Taoist nun whose immortality is at least partly derived from the realization nature contains no moral guidelines, which she treats like a license to be an amoral necromancer. While there is little love lost between Byakuren and the Taoist faction, she responds particularly violently to Seiga.
</li><li> The main character, Reimu, has a shadow archetype in Watatsuki no Yorihime. Both of them are naturally strong and can channel Gods, but Reimu is too carefree and blunt, even lazy, to actually train her own powers much. Yorihime on the other hand is <em>very</em> serious and trains a lot, which means in a fight, Reimu actually loses to Yorihime, despite the fact that Reimu can make herself <em>invincible</em> (for some time).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, Anders and Fenris. Both were essentially enslaved and have a deep, seething hatred of the group that enslaved them; the big difference is that Fenris is a warrior who was enslaved by mages, while Anders is a mage, and so a group of warriors - the Templars - is to him the symbol of subjugation. Both have abilities outside the norm for their class - Fenris has lyrium tattoos that grant him special powers, while Anders is possessed by a spirit of Vengeance that grants him special powers. They hate each other so passionately that there are times one will approve of something they would normally consider horribly unethical just because it pisses the other off.

Throughout the game, Lumina does some morally ambiguous things that ultimately end up working out for the best for Lightning's friends; some might say Lightning is doing the same by submitting to Bhunivelze's servitude. In their one-on-one talks, Lumina pokes and prods Lightning with facts that the savior herself denies or hides; that the "Serah" that appears to her is fake, that Hope in the Ark isn't quite genuine, and that Lightning needs to admit her own weakness and reach out to her friends for help. In the end, Lumina breaks down and cries at the prospect of being left alone in a dead world. When Lightning admits her weakness, she does the same.</span>

At the end of the first game, after Copy X's death, the real X admits that, after a century of non-stop fighting, he began to feel himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">becoming more and more like his copy.</a>

</li></ul></li><li> Revenant Sub-Zero is a dark mirror of Kuai Liang. Though he was an effective assassin of the Lin Kuei, his compassion and assertiveness prevented him from becoming a fully unfeeling and ruthless assassin. His assertiveness was even enough to make him be a good leader to the Lin Kuei. However, as a Revenant, Sub-Zero is none of those. He's completely subservient to Shinnok and Quan Chi, and he follows every order they give and kills their enemies with no remorse whatsoever. In other words, Kuai Liang's Revenant is what he would be if he were truly cold-blooded.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11">Mortal Kombat 11</a></em>: The revenant versions of Nightwolf, Kabal, Sindel, Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Kitana and Jade are dark reflections of their past selves, representing what could happen if they fully embraced the Netherrealm's taint to the point it corrupted their minds.
<ul><li> Liu Kang may be the Chosen One and the champion of two Mortal Kombat tournaments, but Revenant Liu Kang is what would happen if he lets the glory get to his head and lets it rule his decision-making. His entire hate for Raiden and desire for Kronika to rewind time is because he feels that Raiden "stole his glory" by stopping Shao Kahn and killing him accidentally, unaware of the bigger picture.
</li><li> Revenant Kitana is what would happen if Kitana became the perfect daughter Shao Kahn wanted her to be. In other words, if Kitana acted like Mileena. Arrogant, uncompromising, and indifferent to the suffering of her people, Revenant Kitana cares only about using her status to take what she desires and make those she feels has wronged her suffer under her rule, upholding her adoptive father's desire for Outworld "being the conqueror and never the conquered."
</li><li> Much like how Revenant Kitana is Shao Kahn's perfect daughter, Revenant Jade is his perfect assassin. Unlike the living Jade, who remains loyal to Kitana that is still willing to stand up to both her and Kotal when she feels they're acting out of line, Revenant Jade is a cold-hearted killer that obeys whoever she currently serves without question, taking pride in the fact that she has ditched her morals in favor of killing whoever she's ordered to. She even tells her past self that sticking to Kitana would lead to her death, an idea her past self is appalled by.
</li><li> Revenant Kung Lao is what would happen if Kung Lao was purely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenByEnvy">Driven by Envy</a> towards his friend and rival Liu Kang, and only cared about avenging the death of his ancestor instead of fighting for a greater good just as his ancestor did. His entire reason for joining Kronika is so he can have a do-over and defeat Shao Kahn in the tournament to one-up Liu Kang.
</li><li> In <em>11</em>, Sindel is depicted as a queen whose primary belief is that Edenia should embrace its divine heritage and use it to assert power and superiority over other realms. It is because of this belief that she is so compatible with Shao Kahn, as they both desire conquest and an eternal empire to rule over through superior might. Thoguh while she may be evil, Sindel does have her own standards and pride which she upholds to the letter. Her revenant has none of those qualities, meaning she is what would happen if Sindel fought solely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>. Not for her own enjoyment or for what she perceives to be good for her people, but for the sake of a higher power controlling her, thus becoming no different than one of the lowly commoners her living self takes so much pleasure in lording over.
</li><li> Revenant Kabal is this to his past self in <em>11</em>. It's revealed that in the past, while Kabal was a former member of the Black Dragon, he only joined as a sort of "get-rich-quick" plan, forgoing becoming a police officer under the impression that it "wouldn't pay the bills". Eventually, his better soncience would catch up to him, and he would abandon the Black Dragon to repent for his crimes, before being unceremoniously killed in the line of duty, resurrected, and then killed again. While a Black Dragon member, Kabal was very prideful and kowtowed to no one, not even Kano, as it's shown that Kano had to trick Past Kabal in order to get him to fight Sonya. Revenant Kabal, by contrast, is fully subservient to those who command him and, whether he realizes or not, more in line with how Kano viewed him.
</li><li> As with the others resurrected to serve Shinnok, Revenant Nightwolf is this to his past self. Years ago, Nightwolf had fallen from the righteous path and had been at odds with the faith of his people. Revenant Nightwolf is what would happen if he had remained a criminal and givne in to evil. He has completely renounced his faith in the Great Spirit and is now purely devoted to Shinnok.
</li></ul></li><li> Raiden has several Shadow Archetypes:
<ul><li> Shao Kahn, as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> who ill-treats his minions and subjects <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">just for the sake of it.</a> By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11">Mortal Kombat 11</a></em>, everyone in Outworld is sick of his tyrannical reign, and this is frequently lampshaded in arcade endings and character interactions.
</li><li> Kronika, a power-hungry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadGod">Mad God</a> who represents what Raiden could become if he started micromanaging mortals instead of guiding and respecting their free will, corrupting his mind over time. Also, when it comes to gathering followers, Kronika favors manipulation and lying, and discarding her minions when they're of no use. In his <em>MK11</em> arcade ending, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">her minion</a> Geras comments <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">how her repeated attempts to create the ideal timeline have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">whittled away her sanity</a>.</span>
</li><li> Shinnok, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">rogue Elder God</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the son of Kronika</span>. He easily serves to remind Raiden what he can become if his mind became corrupted with a raw lust for power over the realms. In the past, Shinnok was one of the Elder Gods who sealed away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">the One Being</a>, but his desire to lord over the realms caused his peers to banish him to the Netherrealm, where he became its overlord after usurping the position from Lucifer.
</li><li> Dark Raiden serves as this to his original self in <em>11</em>, as he is what happens when Raiden takes his status as Protector of Earthrealm to the worst possible extreme. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">Devoid of mercy and compassion</a>, Dark Raiden will completely destroy any threat to Earthrealm without exception. He'll even go so far as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">obliterate entire realms</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Shao Kahn is also the dark antithesis to Kotal Kahn as well, as while Kotal cares deeply for his people and understands when sacrifices and hard choices are needed in order to ensure his subjects' survival, Shao Kahn is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> who rules as a tyrant and would kill anyone on a whim. In addition to this, Kotal had achieved and attained leadership without murdering his predecessor, while Shao Kahn overthrew his predecessor Onaga and took over at first opportunity.
</li><li> As with her revenant version, Mileena is another example of what would happen if Kitana became Shao Kahn's ideal daughter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and indifferent to the suffering of her people, Mileena cares only about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">using her status</a> to take what she desires. Also, while both Kitana and Mileena do become the rulers of Outworld, Mileena leads it with complete incompetence and was widely despised for her abysmal rule. Mileena is also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">Evil Knockoff</a> of Kitana, having been created from Kitana's essence but also mixed with some Tarkatan genes. The end result is a monster with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicWomanchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicWomanchild">a child's mind</a>.

</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Is Not Evil</a> example is Karkat to John. Both have similar rooms, fulfil similar roles in the plot, and use weapons with a symbolic similarity (John uses a hammer, Karkat uses a sickle). However, their personalities are quite different - John is sweet, mischievous and innocent, and Karkat is bitter, angry, but rather wise. John types in all lower-case, but Karkat types in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice">ALL CAPS</a>. And while both of them love terrible movies, John <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnabashedBMovieFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnabashedBMovieFan">just has really bad taste</a> and defends the quality of the films he loves - Karkat is aware his favourite romcoms are terrible, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasure">loves them passionately anyway</a>. This is one of the reasons why Karkat, at one point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">falls in hate with John</a> (and also one of the reasons why John doesn't reciprocate).

<ul><li> During the Syrup Village Arc, a parallel is created between Natalie and DM, who respectively play Nami and Kurahadol. Natalie lives by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">Rule of Drama</a>, and created Nami with a complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> that makes her hate pirates. However, she's still fully capable of working together with the group while keeping Nami in-character. DM, on the other hand, makes absolutely no effort to intergrate with the others, having Kurahadol blantantly bait and insult them, then refusing to apologise in or out of character. (Unless you count her stating "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJustifications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJustifications">That's just how he is</a>," acting like it's the <em>others</em> fault for not being able to put up with him.)
</li><li> Later in the same arc, another parallel with Luffy's player Luke is revealed: both are all about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">having fun</a>. However, while Luke enjoys playing with his friends and doesn't care whether they 'win' or 'lose', DM only cares about her <em>personal</em> enjoyment. It simply doesn't <strong>matter</strong> that her preferred gaming style constantly screws over everyone else, so long as SHE's having fun.

<ul><li> Freckle and Mordecai are an interesting case as this trope works both ways: both smart kids who join a criminal gang in their late teens when they have nowhere to go and become triggermen in their respective gangs, and both happen to have significant trouble handling social situations. While Freckle is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">painfully shy</a>, nice to anyone remotely nice to him and struggles to remain a good person in spite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">his sudden outursts of rage he can barely control when he has to use a gun</a>, Mordecai is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">cold, calculating, heartless, has no sense of loyalty, only following his own interests</a> and keeps himself in check thanks to his obsession with order. Mordecai is what Freckle would become if he stopped caring about his friends, and Freckle is what Mordecai would become if he didn't control his impulses.
</li><li> Mordecai and Rocky eventually become this as well. Both are intelligent men who, like the above example, are socially awkward and who work in organized crime (and used to be coworkers), and both men are clearly willing to get violent in order to achieve their goals. However, Rocky's intelligence is creative while Mordecai's is strictly logical. Rocky clearly craves affection and validation which fuels most of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">impulsive, eccentric and erratic behavior</a>, while Mordecai largely rejects interpersonal relationships and is a remorseless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sociopath">Sociopath</a>, albeit an extremely ordered and serious one. Rocky's need for affection also fuels his all-consuming loyalty to anyone willing to give him the time of day, while Mordecai has no loyalties beyond himself. Both men also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sustained brain damage which has drastically altered their personalities. A stray bullet to the brain turned the nerdy, anti-social, but basically decent Mordecai into a heartless murderer. While Rocky was always erratic and kind of flaky-in-a-charming-way, his general demeanor has become more...disturbing after he got hit in the head by a hearse. Notably, it isn't clear that Mordecai has sustained such an injury, but Rocky has a large, ugly gash in the middle of his forehead</span>. Rocky is effectively what Mordecai would be if he had empathy but no impulse control, and Mordecai is what Rocky is in danger of becoming if he gives up on trying to gain the approval of others.

Aang tended to default to airbending, his native element, Korra doesn't carry any water with her and tends to use other types of bending more. Korra accepted her identity as the Avatar at such a young age she had trouble finding self-worth outside of it, while Aang didn't want to be the Avatar at first.

Also, much like Batman and his seemingly harmless alter-ego Bruce Wayne, Bullock seems inept as all hell but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">as capable of a fighter as Batman</a> when surrounded by bad guys or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>. He also has that "one rule" he'll never, ever, EVER break, for all his flaws, Bullock is one of the few regular Joes in Gotham that will <em>never</em> take a bribe.

He's just as prideful and arrogant, but while the others have gained experience and made friends on Sodor, Spencer is an unpopular fool that looks his nose down on the others. Downplayed as his character softened slightly in later episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> has one of the most literal examples of this trope in the episode "Rest and Ricklaxation". After going to an alien spa to get the toxic parts of their personalities removed, a version of the titular characters called Toxic Rick and Toxic Morty are created. They don't just contain Rick and Morty's negative traits, but also traits they <em>feel</em> are negative, even things most people would consider good (in Rick's case his compassion for Morty).
</li><li> Sarah Lynn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a></em> proves to be one to her cast-mates, including BoJack, showing that, for as messed up as they may be (save for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Bradley</a>), they could have it <em>much</em> worse.

Both are the only known girls to wear hats, are very intelligent, and harbored romantic feelings for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Eric Cartman</a>. However Wendy does to recognize how having feelings for a person like Cartman could have a negative impact on her life, while Heidi is refuses acknowledge this fact and continued to be Cartman's girlfriend, letting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToxicFriendInfluence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToxicFriendInfluence">influence</a> change her. As a result, Wendy was able to resolve and lose all her feelings for Cartman on her own and keep her self-worth and identity, while Heidi became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">female version</a> of Cartman until an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingResponse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingResponse">Armor-Piercing Response</a> from Kyle makes her realize the follies of her feelings.

Both were once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">heroic characters</a> whose bad choices has caused them to be shunned by society, with only Kyle trying to help them, only for them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">to take a level in jerkass</a> and mistreat Kyle resulting in him giving up on them. However, Heidi would eventually learn to take responsibility for her own actions, while Mr. Hankey would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">constantly refuse to do so</a> continuing to blame his behavior on Ambien(R).

Like Kion, Scar once had the Roar of the Elders and led his own Lion Guard during Mufasa's reign, but lost the Roar permanently when he used it to kill his own Lion Guard for refusing to back him in his plot to overthrow Mufasa. For this reason, Kion actively strives to not become another Scar. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Some scenes in season 3 even depict Scar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter">actively attempting to corrupt Kion.</a></span>

<ul><li> Catra parallels multiple people. She mirrors Adora (raised in the same toxic environment, but Adora left and began to recover while Catra stayed and ended up stewing in the venom), Glimmer (both intent on earning the love and respect of a parental figure, but Glimmer's is a decent person who happens to have faults while Catra's is an abusive, self-serving monster), and even Shadow Weaver (Catra is, in many ways, a continuation of the cycle of abuse begun by Shadow Weaver...but Shadow Weaver's cruelty is driven by her arrogant and self-serving nature, while Catra's, founded as it is in her past as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">The Un-Favourite</a>, is more self-destructive, with her envy driving her to continually hurt the people around her and make her own life worse).
</li><li> Entrapta is, in many ways, Bow without the moral compass. They're both smart, compassionate, technically savvy, care about their friends and like learning new things...but Bow is also committed to the side of the Rebellion because he knows why the Horde is a problem (what with all the warmongering and burning down villages), while Entrapta has trouble seeing anything outside her immediate circle of friends and her research.
</li><li> In many ways, Hordak is a dark mirror image of Adora. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Like Adora, he was intended to be an obedient tool in his predecessor's war machine. Neither he nor Adora were supposed to bond with others, as this would distract them from their intended purpose (Light Hope frowns upon Adora's friendships, and Horde Prime is angered by Hordak's love for Entrapta). Both he and Adora have acted on free will and developed strong personalities in spite of their predecessors' intentions. However, Hordak uses his autonomy to conquer Etheria in a futile attempt to win Horde Prime's respect, while Adora uses her autonomy to stop the Etherian superweapon and reclaim her own destiny. Hordak is intentionally or unintentionally mimicking Horde Prime in his tyranny, while Adora is transcending the evil ways of the First Ones.</span>

They end up finding other kids who were exaggerated versions of themselves, Tommy hanging with a girl covered in bandages from getting banged up all the time, Chuckie finding a kid who was crippled by all their phobias. They both recognized the value of their friendship after spending an episode dealing with these kids.

<p class="_pmvv-vidbox-descTxt" id="overlay-descrip">
After witnessing the destructive power of the Roar of the Elders, Kion worries about becoming very much like Scar and consults with his grandfather Mufasa on his fears, but Mufasa reassures Kion that he'll never be like Scar. Like Kion, Scar once had the Roar, but selfishly abused its power and lost it permanently.	</p>
