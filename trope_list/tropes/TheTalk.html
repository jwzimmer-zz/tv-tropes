May be occasioned by the question, "Where do babies come from?"
</p><p><strong>Comes in two flavours</strong>:
</p><p><strong>Awkward</strong>: A serious conversation that runs the gamut from mildly awkward to horribly painful, with the elder speaking nervously and the younger reaching for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainBleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainBleach">Brain Bleach</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">The sexual acts and organs themselves are always described circumspectly</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotActuallyTheUltimateQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotActuallyTheUltimateQuestion">One frequent subversion is that the kid was asking for completely innocuous information</a>, like what to put on the "Sex" line of a form.
</p><p><strong>Ironic</strong>: A humorous conversation in which the child proves to be far more versed in the subject than their parent, having already learned the Facts of Life from school, friends, and media, or even through firsthand experience. May end with the fascinated parents taking notes or interjecting "You can <em>do</em> that?" This subversion is common enough that it has become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromTheMouthsOfBabes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromTheMouthsOfBabes">a trope in itself</a> (which makes this an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope">Undead Horse Trope</a>).

<ul><li> There was a Swedish ice cream manufacturer (whose trick was the fact that they drove up to your driveway, selling ice cream to the whole neighborhood) whose commercial showed a young boy showing a condom to his father and asking what it was and the father trying to figure out what to tell his son, only to be interrupted by the insane, yet addictive jingle that tells us that the ice cream truck is about, and then distracting the kid by offering him ice cream. Cut to the kid eating ice cream in front of the ice cream truck and showing the condom to another kid who <em>also</em> had a condom.
</li><li> There is McDonald's commercial where a young kid asks his father what sex is. They go to eat and you see him making gestures <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">but don't hear what he says</a>. After he's done the child says "all that goes here?" and shows a sign up sheet for soccer that was asking what his gender was.
</li><li> McDonald's are obviously fond of this trope - they also had an ad in the UK where a man finally succeeds in deflecting his daughter's questions about where babies come from by suggesting a trip to McDonald's.
</li><li> A PSA had a thirteen-year-old boy come home from school, only to find that his dad had set up a diagram to talk about sex. Dad gives the kid a choice: talk about drugs, or talk about sex. They decide to talk about drugs.
</li><li> There is a really funny car ad in New Zealand, where a boy asks his father where he came from. The father then proceeds to explain to the son (with music playing on top of his words) while driving, with the help of visual innuendo and gestures. At the end, it doesn't end well.
</li><li> A Nando's ad from Australia has a kid asking his father where came from. He responds with a golfing analogy, talking about how he sometimes gets a 'hole in one' (just as his wife returns to the table). The kid then says that he thought they came from England.
</li><li> According to one blurb about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheMostInterestingManInTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheMostInterestingManInTheWorld">The Most Interesting Man in the World</a>: "He gave his father The Talk."

Flo even asks the mother if she'd rather the kid "learned it on the streets."

(Which doesn't teach them about how sex actually works, or birth control, or STI prevention, or healthy relationships, or consent, or positive body image, or treating women with respect.)

What makes it <em>hilarious</em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelaxOVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelaxOVision">Relax-o-Vision</a> (and music) accompanying the scene, and then, when Nyamo is sober again the next morning, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Chiyo asks some questions.</a> Watch the whole scene <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY8L_apFieE#t=1m20s">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Fumoffu</a></em>, Kaname gives a sort of similar talk to Sōsuke (though it was more explaining what "flirting" and "picking up women" is). No dialogue is heard, and his reaction is to turn deathly pale and break out into cold sweat, stammering that he "can't do that." Lord knows what his reaction would be should anyone ever give him The Talk about explicit sex. "Listen up! Flirting is... (fast forward mode) When a guy talks to a girl he doesn't know in the city or a store to invite them to hang around with them. The trick is to smile often, and show that you are a cheerful guy. If the girl agrees to come along, you can take her to a cafe or anywhere else you want. Entertain her plenty, smile constantly, and bring up conversations that modern girls would enjoy talking about. And be sure to include some moderate amount of compliments in between. And you have to pay the bill. In short, just act like Kurz-kun." At which point Sōsuke realizes he's in waaay over his head... (The dialogue has been Transcribed by intensive use of freeze-frame on a subtitled version of that episode.)
</li><li> Surprisingly enough, a similar phenomenon comes up in, of all things, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a></em> movie. Shun has spent the first parts of the movie talking about how his mother sent him to find Ryu, but Ken notices something.

</li><li> Off-hand mentioned in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakutenShootBeyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakutenShootBeyblade">Bakuten Shoot Beyblade</a></em> when Tyson tries to sneak away from his grandfather:

Kirie, frustrated, spends the rest of the night educating Touta on the subject (not a euphemism, she gets out a blackboard and starts teaching him as though in a classroom). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And when that fails to work, she just pulls up some porn on pay-per-view to show him.</span>
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>, Kaguya, Kurogane, and Fujiwara come across a magazine article that says just over a third of people their age have had their "first time" by then. Kurogane and Fujiwara are surprised it's so high, but Kaguya thinks it's about right, if not <em>low</em>. However, she then goes on to say it's very common to the point she did it with her newborn nephew and expects Fujiwara did it with her <em>dog</em>. This results in the obvious question of what Kaguya <em>thinks</em> "first time" means, and Kaguya reveals she's talking about kissing, as that's the extent of her sexual education. Fujiwara steps up to the plate and, sixteen minutes later, Kaguya is both educated and flustered beyond belief.

In other words, the kid wanted to know what Psalms 23:4 meant.</span>
</li><li> A kid comes home from school and says "We learned how to make babies today!" Her mom doesn't think that sex ed was on the curriculum so she asks, "Really? How?" The kid says "Well, you take off the 'y' and add 'ies'."
</li><li> A Frenchwoman asks her husband to give their son The Talk, but be sensitive about it and start with bees and butterflies. The man goes to his son and tells him: "Pierre, remember our visit to Madam Josie's place last week?" "Yes, papa." "Well, bees and butterfly have it the same way."
</li><li> A widowed mother, raising her son by herself is seeing him get married, but she never had the time to have The Talk with him as she was so busy working for the family. She pulled her son over after the ceremony and told him "Son, I've never had time to tell you the facts of life in detail, so I'll make this quick. When you go to bed with your wife tonight, take the stiffest part of your body and jam it in the place where she uses the bathroom." The son nods in agreement, hugs mom, and takes off with his wife for their honeymoon. A little after midnight, mother's phone rings. She groggily answers "Hello?" It's her son: "Mom, I jammed my foot in the toilet. <em>Now</em> what?"
</li><li> A mother tells her son that in their honeymoon he should do that thing dogs do in the street. So that night he proceeds to raise his leg and pee on her.
</li><li> A girl went to her mother and asked where the new baby next door came from. The mother explained that the stork had dropped him off.

The father thinks to himself "well, the time has finally come I guess", takes a deep breath, and launches into a deep, long-winded explanation of the entire thing: men's and women's body parts, the physical aspects of the act, pregnancy, childbirth, the whole lot. After he's done, he asks his wide-eyed son "Why did you ask all of a sudden?"

His father told him to keep a schedule of one night per wife, eldest to youngest, repeat, and never let his wives know who his favourite is if he has one. What his grandfather taught him is only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod">hinted at</a>. Where babies come from seems to be common knowledge in the setting, as men are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRarityValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRarityValue">extremely rare</a> and Jerin's former teacher freely tells him that she looks forward to getting married; not so much because of the husband but because of the pregnancy. On the other hand, it is considered improper to talk about miscarriage and stillbirth in front of young menfolk like Jerin.

<ul><li> There were two attempts by the older witches in the Lancre Coven to explain it to Magrat (who's almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Chaste Heroine</a>). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters">Wyrd Sisters</a></em>, Granny Weatherwax quickly decides (as she did with Esk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites">Equal Rites</a></em>) that she's not up to the task, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero">Celibate Heroine</a> herself. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies">Lords and Ladies</a></em>, the decidedly non-celibate Nanny Ogg makes a more spirited attempt that is completely misunderstood ("After the wedding, is what I'm hinting about." "Oh, <em>that</em>. No, most of that's being done by a caterer."), although it later transpires that Magrat was deliberately winding her up (and instead has sent away for a book on the subject, which turns out to be on <em>martial arts</em>, not marital arts). Verrence instead gets his information from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">Casanunda</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BawdySong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BawdySong">an interesting song sung by Nanny Ogg</a>. They eventually also manage to get a proper book on marital arts; Nanny finds it one day while snooping around in the Royal bedroom. She spends a few productive minutes drawing mustaches on the pictures, which leads to Verence asking where he could buy some false mustaches. They apparently figure it out eventually, as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em> starts with the birth of their daughter.

It leads to a very, very amusing conversation, and gets even more awkward for the wizards when the normally straitlaced housekeeper, Mrs. Whitlow, volunteers to explain "the facts of life" to the God (and prompts the wizards to wonder, out of morbid curiouity, what Mr. Whitlow's life was like).
</li><li> At another point in the book, when the wizards are facing down the notion that they are the only men and Mrs. Whitlow the only woman who are likely to come along for some time (like thousands of years), they speculate that there must have been a Mr. Whitlow at some point, because she's, well, <em>Mrs.</em> Whitlow. A different book references a "Hepzibah Whitlow" in passing, who may be related, and, if the actual wizard rules on marriage (frowned upon, but never actually forbidden, as such) are anything to go by, may even be the man we're looking for. Incidentally, in her first appearance in <em>Equal Rites</em>, Mrs. Whitlow is stated to have out-lived <em>four</em> husbands.

</li><li> In the novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDukeAndI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDukeAndI">The Duke And I</a></em>, Violet Bridgerton has had 8 children, and yet still can't get up the nerve to give the talk to her oldest daughter Daphne the night before her wedding. This leads to a reverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissConception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissConception">Miss Conception</a> situation, where Daphne (who wants kids) has no idea that what her husband's doing with her will actively prevent them.

In the novel it just comes across as fairly uncomfortable, but in the movie (see above) Billy Burke and Kristen Stewart's reactions make it hilarious.
</li><li> In the last book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">The Collegium Chronicles</a></em>. Herald Jakyr asks Mags about his relationship with Amily and is prepared to give him some form of The Talk. Mags explains that he knows the basics, but has no clue about how to make it pleasurable for Amily. Herald Jakyr, realizing that his planned speech is useless, then proceeds to explain to Mags (who is horribly embarrassed by this) how to go about doing exactly that.

<ul><li> This comes up in a heartbreaking way in the episode "Competence", involving a young pregnant woman with Down Syndrome. The girl's mother had never given her The Talk or allowed her to take sex-ed classes at her day center, believing she wasn't mature enough for that information, and the girl's lack of knowledge hampers detectives' efforts to determine who fathered the baby (and thus determine if it was consensual sex or if she was raped). When another character finally explains to her how babies are made, she replies "That's not sex — that's exercise!" It turned out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the girl's boss at her part-time job</span> had been raping mentally disabled girls for years and calling it exercise, counting on them being too sheltered to know otherwise.

Hal sits Reese, Malcolm, and Dewey down for "the talk" (because he doesn't want to have to have a separate talk for each one), complete with an action figure and something that resembles a Barbie. Beginning with "I wanna tell you about what happens when a boy really likes a girl," shortly into the talk he follows with "...and if they love each other, and take the proper precautions, they have sex. But I've told you about that already." <em>This</em> talk turns out to be about how the men in the family do everything possible to screw up relationships.

Lois finds out that Malcolm and his girlfriend are getting serious and, since she's leaving soon and won't have time to give him all the lessons he needs, drags poor Malcolm around in an endless car-trip where she tells him <em>in graphic detail</em> everything she thinks he'll ever need to know about sex. Subverted in that Malcolm already knows all of this and doesn't want to hear it from his mom... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then double-subverted when he actually learns an extremely important lesson from her towards the end</span>.

After much stalling ("In order for you to be brought about... it was necessary for your mother and I... to do something.") he makes wild claims that his son's conception was through his mother sitting in the same chair that he had been in and "was still warm... from my body". The conversation eventually escalates into them discussing Uncle Bertie ("Dirty Uncle Bertie they call him at school." "And they're right, Roger! Uncle Bertie is a dirty, <em>dirty</em> man"). <a class="urllink" href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=d0Z1QGpTZSo">The sketch can be viewed here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Laurie replies "I always sort of assumed that you put your penis into mummy's vagina and then intercourse occured". Fry responds that this is indeed what they told him but that it is a bit more complicated than that, going on to say that somehow carpets are involved in the process. (The whole sketch turns into a spoof plug for the show's supposed sponsor's "Tideyman's Carpets').
</li><li> Even better in another Fry and Laurie sketch when a father (Laurie) brings his son to the headmaster (Fry) complaining about the "vulgar lies" his son had been taught in his biology class. "Sexual intercourse sometimes leads to pregnancy in the adult female." Apparently the man believed that children came out of nowhere after a man and woman had gotten married and bought a house.

She's especially not looking forward to it because she and her ex-husband agreed that she'd give the Talk to their daughter Elena, and he'd give it to Alex, but because he's absent, Penelope has wound up stuck with both of them. When Penelope tries to have the discussion, Alex is absolutely mortified and hides under a blanket, asking why Penelope is doing this to him... and then it turns out that <em>Elena</em> is the one who downloaded the movie, meaning Penelope is talking to the wrong kid anyway. (Elena, being fifteen, already knows the facts of life, but the movie is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">apparently</a> extreme enough that Penelope is worried that a teen watching it might get the wrong idea about sex.) When Elena gets home, Alex hands her the blanket, cryptically warning her, "You'll need this..."

Then Peggy, a substitute teacher, was asked to sub for the biology class, so she had to work to overcome her aversion to The Talk.
