Either it is a purely symbolic function with no actual power, or the title itself is made up, and it has no genuine authority over its "subjects". As such, most characters of this trope have no one (except for the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">Professional Butt-Kisser</a>) who actually respects their non-existent authority. May often be referred to as the Pretender to the Throne or claim he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillTheLeader">Still the Leader</a>.
</p><p>In terms of the ranks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityTropes">Authority Tropes</a>, the next steps up are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">The Caligula</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodChancellor">The Good Chancellor</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt">Standard Royal Court</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt">Decadent Court</a>.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayorOfAGhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayorOfAGhostTown">Mayor of a Ghost Town</a>, where the person <em>is</em> a recognized authority figure, it's just that there's no one left to rule over. Also contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen">Just the First Citizen</a>, where the figure doesn't claim a grand title but holds the real power nevertheless — the diametric inverse of this trope. For characters who actually do wield tyrannical control over some place, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOwnThisTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOwnThisTown">I Own This Town</a>. Can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a> if the title is actually bestowed by someone else who <em>does</em> have real authority, often specifically to appease the victim or move them out of the way.

<ul><li> Luffy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is the official captain of the Straw Hats, but considering he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> in most situations they pretty much do their own thing, with Nami taking charge as often as not. Exceptions do exist, as they will defer to Luffy when making decision either affecting the crew in a big way, or when deciding where to head next, Luffy does have the last word. When he says to sail for an incredibly dangerous-sounding island and uses the phrase "captain's orders", the others do not argue, even if some of them may facepalm. On a day-to-day-basis, though, Nami is usually acting as captain.
<ul><li> This isn't that far removed from how many ships operated back in the day. The captain was a strong leader with the final say in all things, but it was the quartermaster who managed daily rations and made sure everything that needed doing was adequately done.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, the position of "Sub-Viceroy of Area 11 (formerly Japan)" was created for Euphemia by Cornelia. However, the position is basically just a figurehead's job, which several characters mention during her tenure. Even her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">creation of the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan</span> was the result of her going to Schneizel for help.
<ul><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">Novelization</a> where it's spelled out that Euphemia may be a figurehead, but she's a remarkably <em>accomplished</em> figurehead. Due to Cornelia's tendency to dump all the social appearances required of the Viceroy on her little sister, like galas, inauguration ceremonies, charity events and the like, Euphemia soon became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace">The Face</a> of the Britannian government. That together with her non-discriminatory nature, and actions like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Knighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Knighting">Knighting</a> an Honorary Britannian (i.e. a Japanese man), made Euphemia very popular among the Japanese, which took a lot of popular support away from the Black Knights. Later on, her good rep also helped to sell the idea of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Special Administrative Zone</span> to the population, a political gesture that could have spelled the end of the Black Knights and forcing Lelouch to plot his half-sister's downfall — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">something that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">backfired</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">horribly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">right</a>.</span>
</li><li> Turns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nunnally</span>, when appointed as <em>Viceroy</em>, has even less power than Euphemia had as sub. Gino even has to remind Lohmeyer, ostensibly said Viceroy's personal assistant, of who is supposed to be Viceroy.
</li><li> C.C. claims her time as Director of the Geass Order was this, saying she didn't have any real power like V.V. and Charles did.
</li></ul></li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>, Jack Atlas was known as the King of the Riding Duels. He didn't know that his title meant nothing. He was a puppet being manipulated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Rex Godwin</a> to entertain the people of Neo Domino and maintain the illusion of a utopia, and a lot of his victories, like the one against Dragan, were rigged without him knowing. Bommer even called him out on this during the Fortune Cup, calling him a "poor king" (and when Jack tried to hit him for the insult, knocked the punch aside as if he didn't care). (In Jack's defense, after Godwin's fall, he would later prove during the WRGP that he was capable of defeating Dragan in a fair duel when the two faced each other again. Although, to be honest, this was after Jack had acquired Burning Soul, an ability he didn't have the first time.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful">The World is Still Beautiful</a></em>, Nike's father is the duke of the Rain Dukedom but doesn't actually hold any power, and even admits as such to Livius. Instead, the power is held by Nike's grandmother.

</li><li> Zigzagged with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a></em>, who has legitimate authority as the ruler of Latveria, but who doesn't hold an actual doctorate despite his title. Of course, with all his power he probably gave himself one.

Too bad King Loki is also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> and got the title by virtue of killing off the entire population so there is no one to be the king <em>of</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a></em> has Izaya the Highfather, a rare example of this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">being framed in a completely positive light</a>. Despite being regarded as a very important figure, his actual lawful authority is mostly nonexistent—his duty is more of a religious or ceremonial one, that being to interpret the will of the Source. In his first appearance, he even points out to Orion that if he doesn't want to follow Highfather's request, there will be no repercussions for him if he refuses. People follow what Highfather says not out of duty or fear of punishment, but because they personally believe that what he says is the right thing to do. This is to contrast him with his rival Darkseid, who rules with an iron fist and answers a refused request with immediate disintegration if he's feeling merciful.

This is fixed at the end of the season finale, when Princess Luna officially decrees that the Bearers of the Elements of Harmony (both current and any future) will hereafter hold the rank of Knights of the Realm, with all powers and privileges appertaining thereunto. In addition, they also get the Right Of Approach, which means that if they want to talk to the Princess, <em>only</em> the Princess can turn them away.

<ul><li> Robert Baratheon. While he's still the <em>official</em> king of Westeros, only the Crownlands and the Stormlands still respect his authority after the Remembering. Everyone else has pledged themselves to House Targaryen, more specifically Jon, making him both the rightful and <em>actual</em> king. The only holdout is Dorne, who's not inclined to side with either side thanks to Elia Martell, and is currently too embroiled in their own internal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> to be anyone's concern. And since everyone is avoiding contact with King's Landing, Robert is <em>completely unaware of this</em>. He doesn't even become aware of Jon's existence until one of Hoster Tully's bannermen secretly betrays him, and by that point there's no hope of him swaying any of the other kingdoms back to his side.
</li><li> Ned Stark. Officially, he's the Head of House Stark. In reality, only Catelyn, Robb, and Rickon really listen to him. Bran and Arya do what they want, while Sansa only takes orders from Jon. Jon, while raised as a member of House Stark, is actually the head of House Targaryen, and his orders therefore supersede Ned's since he's king.
</li><li> Catelyn Stark as well. Officially, she's returned to being the Lady of Winterfell. In reality nobody trusts her anymore thanks to her disastrous mistakes in the previous timeline, so Sansa has taken most of her duties instead. To make it official, Sansa is named an emissary by Jon after he departs from Winterfell for the Wall, putting her above Catelyn in status.
</li><li> Robin Arryn is the current Lord Paramount of the Vale and the Head of House Arryn. However, as he's currently a child who's nowhere close to his majority, all the power is in his new regent and caretaker, Bronze Yohn Royce.

It's mentioned several times that his father Jules Corrino would never have allowed the likes of Manford Torondo (the leader of the fanatical Butlerians) and Josef Venport (the CEO of what would eventually become the Spacing Guild) to hold so much power in the Imperium and even dictate terms to the Emperor. Meanwhile, Salvador's brother Roderick is much more competent but is also fiercely loyal to his brother, even stopping a Sisterhood conspiracy that would leave him in power over his inept brother. While it's true that both Manford and Josef hold enormous power (Manford through his ability to incite mob violence, and Josef through having a monopoly on spice mining and a nigh-monopoly on foldspace shipping), it's also made clear that part of that lies with Salvador's previous policies that turned the Imperial military into a shadow of its former self by assigning command posts based on political motives rather than by merit. Roderick understands this, but Salvador is insistent on playing politics.

Every time Pteppic tries to use his alleged authority, everyone ignores him and waits for Dios to declare what the pharaoh's decision is (Which usually has absolutely nothing to do with what Pteppic had said).

In practice, the only thing he ever does is the traditional annual Address (Basically a State of the Union speech). All real power (Including deciding what Erek says in said Address) is wielded by Chancellor Trynair, to the point where people joke that Erek demonstrates his independence from the Chancellor by deciding what shoes to wear in the morning. It eventually gets to the point where an coup breaks out in the holy city and the fate of the reigning Grand Vicar isn't even <em>mentioned</em> beyond the fact that someone else ends up with the title. Over the course of the series Trynair also transitions into this as the Inquisition grabs more and more power.

The Commonwealth of Tyre is a constitutional monarchy and therefore King Hadrian, while commander-in-chief of the military, has much less legal power than Parliament... <em>in peacetime</em>. In wartime, however, Commonwealth law grants him absolute power, rather like the classical Greek "tyrant". This provision of the War Powers Act has never actually been activated before (because the Commonwealth has never had to declare war before), and Hadrian fully expects it to be amended after the war is over.

Lift is in Tashikk, and when the local government gets word from the Emperor to follow her instructions they do so, even when her orders include referring to her as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Your Pancakefullness</a>". Right up until a massive storm unexpectedly rolls in and they ignore Lift to deal with the disaster.

This theoretically gives him command over the Vale's armies, which is enough to make Ned Stark worried about what would happen if Jaime also got his father's position as Warden of the West. In practice, since the position's always been given to an Arryn, the Vale lords are suspicious about what role the Lannisters might have played in Jon Arryn's death, and Westeros is going through a civil war, he has absolutely no control over the Vale and the Lannisters are forced to give the position to Robert Arryn to win the his mother's official loyalty.

In one episode Michael admits that it isn't even a real position, he just made it up one day to keep Dwight quiet; Dwight takes this very hard. In a later season, Dwight purchases the building that the branch operates out of, which does give him the ability to control things like temperature, lighting, and the ply of the toilet paper, but this doesn't really give him any actual power (other than a higher-than-average degree of job security, of course).

Carcetti at the same time can't fire Burrell without having ready an African-American replacement due to the fact that Carcetti himself is a white mayor in a city with a majority black population. Finding a replacement is further complicated by a lack of ranking African-American officers in the department besides Burrell. There is only one African-American Deputy Commissioner named Hawthorne, who is over 70 years old, and no African-American officers over the rank of Colonel. The next highest ranking African-Americans in the department are Majors and Lieutenants, most of whom such as Major Reed are loyal to Burrell and his methods of policing.

So, in essence, his authority extends as far as The Poopsmith and anyone who's on the far end of The Poopsmith's billy club. "Strong Badia the Free" actually lampshades the fact: Strong Bad is in the middle of answering an email, telling the writer that the KoT is pretty much harmless since he's too old and demented to do much damage, when the King barges in, Poopsmith in both riot gear and tow, to inform Strong Bad that he's delinquent on his taxes.

But a bishop is supposed to be the head of a diocese, and a bishopric in a real diocese is a full-time job. The church instead assigns bishops intended to work in the Vatican to a "titular see", which is a diocese that's no longer extant. (Most are located in the Middle East or North Africa, areas that were wholly Christian before the advent of Islam.) The best-known titular bishop might be Nicolaus Steno (aka Neils Stensen), the Titular Bishop of Titiopolis, a geologist and the subject of an essay by Stephen Jay Gould.
</li><li> Nominal dioceses over areas lacking active Christian congregations have been also been used as a means to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">reassign bishops to Antarctica</a>, particularly if the bishop in question has unusual opinions and/or criticizes Church policy but hasn't actually broken with Church doctrine.
</li></ul></li><li> South Korea, which claims to be the rightful government of the <em>entire</em> Korean peninsula, appoints governors for its Northern "provinces". Nobody's sure what they actually do (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_Five_Northern_Korean_Provinces">the closest estimate being the "North Korean defector resettlement office"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), but reportedly the offices are quite busy. (Incidentally, North Korea makes the exact same claim, but there's only one authority up there.)
</li><li> Colonel Harland Sanders, founder of KFC, was not a Colonel in any military sense. Rather, he was a Kentucky colonel, a title of honor in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, given by the governor and the secretary of state to individuals in recognition of noteworthy accomplishments and outstanding service to a community, state, or the nation. Sanders was given the honor <em>twice</em> for his work in the food industry. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_colonel">More info on it here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Other notable colonels include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp">Johnny Depp</a>. Thompson also acquired the title of Doctor from the Universal Life Church.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>'s manager Colonel Tom Parker's title was an honorary one for the Louisiana State Militia, given to him for helping out with Jimmie Davis' successful campaign for governor in 1944.
</li></ul></li><li> Ugandan dictator Idi Amin Dada had a few of these, the most infamous to movie goers being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastKingOfScotland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastKingOfScotland">The Last King of Scotland</a>. His full title was "His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular", among other dubious claims.
</li><li> Most monarchies have been slowly transitioning towards this over the centuries, with most of the official duties of the crown being ceremonial, and the remainder being things they technically only do when the elected government asks them to do it. For example, the British Monarch is the only person with the authority to name a Prime Minister, and has the authority to name whoever he/she chooses, whenever he/she chooses, but in practice the Monarch always selects the leader of the party or coalition of parties that controls the House of Commons, and does so only when the party leadership or control of the House of Commons changes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4tx5l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4tx5l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4tx5l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the event of the Government falling apart, the Monarch genuinely can name whoever he/she wants as a placeholder PM until the next election, but that doesn't happen often</span>.
<ul><li> Parliamentary republics work in a similar way, except that they have ceremonial presidents instead of monarchs.
</li></ul></li><li> In theory Canada has the British Queen/King as head of State, and he/she is represented by a Governor General who is allowed to exercise most of the monarch's power on their behalf, including the power to appoint anyone to be the Prime Minister. Of course in practice the Governor General simply appoints the leader of the party with the most seats in Parliament and the Governor General is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister (read: he tells her who to pick), which means the powers of both positions are mostly symbolic.
<ul><li> This is actually true of most Commonwealth Realms (Commonwealth nations that recognize the British monarch as their head of state). However, Canada did it first—it's the oldest (and biggest, in every sense) Commonwealth Realm.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vgth');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5vgth" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vgth');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unless you count the UK itself as a Commonwealth Realm, in which case Canada is second-oldest and second-biggest in every sense except land area, but that's another story.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Many African republics are home to a number of "traditional rulers" and tribal leaders who are referred to as kings or some equivalent title (i.e. emir). The national government typically offers some official recognition of their status, but they have no actual legal power. Examples include the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwill_Zwelithini_kaBhekuzulu">King of the Zulus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and actual <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_traditional_rulers">Nigerian princes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Due to complications involving a farming co-operative's tax dispute and the government simply forgetting to file certain paperwork (seriously), a small area of land in Australia has technically seceded from the nation and become Terra Nullius technically owned by the co-operative, making the area a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanyTown">Company Town</a>. The board members of the co-op have total authority there, although with a relatively tiny spit of farmland to their name there's not much to be done with it. While they have printed their own currency (mostly as a joke) it's valued 1:1 with the Australian dollar, which is also accepted there. The Australian government likes to pretend this never happened, having quietly changed the long-obsolete law that allowed it, and treats the area as a single corporate entity that doesn't pay taxes.
</li><li> When Aslam Maskhadov was elected as President of Chechnya following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChechnyaWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChechnyaWars">First Chechen War</a>, his authority was undermined by his field commanders who had turned into warlords and held the real power and influence in the country. By the time of the Second Chechen War happened, Maskhadov was just one of the many warlords with their own militias and they wouldn't answer to anyone but themselves individually.
</li><li> Arguably, the <em>entirety</em> of the United States' Continental Congress, which was designed to have as little authority as possible. It lasted from September 5, 1774 to April 2, 1789 (by which time the new constitution had been ratified and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> elected president). At its last meeting, only two people attended: member Philip Pell and the Secretary of Congress Charles Thomson. According to the last entry in the <em>Journal of the Congress of the Confederate States of America</em> (what the Continental Congress was called at the time, not <em>that</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Confederate States Of America</a>): "The hour of 2 o'clock having arrived, the Speaker announced that the House stood adjourned <em>sine die</em>" (Latin for "without day", i.e. "indefinitely".) Washington was inaugurated the next month, and Thomson handed over the Great Seal and resigned as secretary that July, which officially ended the Continental Congress.
