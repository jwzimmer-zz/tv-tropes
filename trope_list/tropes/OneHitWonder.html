If they're lucky, their next single may chart as well, but despite the ubiquitous fame of their first hit, they never really take off.
</p><p>It is not uncommon for a group to be a one-hit wonder then break up, allowing one or more members to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout">become (more) successful solo acts</a>. It is also not uncommon for the one hit to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">atypical of their oeuvre</a>. Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">Tough Act to Follow</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">One-Book Author</a>. Of course, if sufficient backlash is applied, they will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Never Live It Down</a>. Note that a one-hit wonder on the American charts may be a different story in other countries; many popular European artists, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman">Gary Numan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieGoesToHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieGoesToHollywood">Frankie Goes to Hollywood</a>, charted only once in America. For that matter, many American artists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queensryche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queensryche">Queensrÿche</a> have only charted once in their homeland <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">but are popular in foreign markets such as Europe, Asia and Australia.</a> Likewise, there are many artists who only once reached the mainstream Top 40, but are respected figures and even trendsetting within their genre; several such examples are listed below.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>But usually, a "one-hit wonder" is defined by cultural impact rather than chart placements. For example, if an artist has a massive #1 hit, getting a #40 will technically disqualify them as per <em>Billboard</em>'s definition of a one-hit wonder, but it's highly unlikely that the #40 will continue to be remembered over time and they will likely become a textbook example of such an artist (well-known examples of this situation include the cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chamillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chamillionaire">Chamillionaire</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TommyTutone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TommyTutone">Tommy Tutone</a>, Rockwell, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanessaCarlton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanessaCarlton">Vanessa Carlton</a>). Their "second hit" doesn't have to only scrape the bottom of the top 40 to ensure they be remembered as such. In fact, there are a handful of artists who were massive in their prime, and even though they still had clearly defined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Songs</a>, nobody would ever consider labelling them as one-hit wonders. However, as time goes on, the artists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco">fall so hard into obscurity</a> or the signature song's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic status and ubiquity</a> so overshadows their other work that their discographies are almost completely forgotten outside of the signature song. Thus, they are erroneously looked back upon as a one-hit wonder — acts like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce">Vanilla Ice</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SouljaBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SouljaBoy">Soulja Boy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickAstley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickAstley">Rick Astley</a>, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer">MC Hammer</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0g51k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0g51k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0g51k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">All of whom had at least two top ten hits, with Astley even having two #1 singles</span> are commonly thought of as one-hit wonders for this very reason.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>There are other artists, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGratefulDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGratefulDead">The Grateful Dead</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a>, who are well-regarded legends with plenty of classics under their belts, but through some fluke or stroke of luck, ended up with just one Top 40 hit a piece. Some observers and music writers believe these acts don't count as one-hit wonders, merely artists that had one Top 40 hit and more of a piece of chart trivia than a specific label.
</p><p>For further reading, and a good definition of who may and may not be a one-hit wonder, check out <a class="urllink" href="http://www.villagevoice.com/music/100-and-single-three-rules-to-define-the-term-one-hit-wonder-in-2012-6637330">this 2012 article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <em>The Village Voice</em>. It largely focuses on the specific cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OwlCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OwlCity">Owl City</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarlyRaeJepsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarlyRaeJepsen">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>, both of whom are generally considered one-hit wonders despite the fact that their collaboration "Good Time" became a top 10 hit, but also looks at the term "one-hit wonder" from a broader aspect (for example, Rick Springfield, who had five top 10 hits but is still primarily known for his only #1 hit, "Jessie's Girl").
</p><p>There are countless examples, so this article will only list a handful of representative samples. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder">No-Hit Wonder</a>, wherein an artist manages long-term success without even so much as <em>one</em> big hit, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder">Two-Hit Wonder</a>, where an artist is lucky enough to score a second hit. Also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlessHitAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlessHitAlbum">Hitless Hit Album</a>, where an artist has a hit album with no hit songs. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit">Breakthrough Hit</a>, where one hit leads to a string of later hits. Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> which is the biggest hit. May overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">Small Reference Pools</a>, especially non-music examples. Many of the artists listed here are mislabeled because they have a signature song but still had lesser hits. There have been rare instances where the band had a Top 40 hit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement">but it is not their most popular song and the signature song the band is known for didn't chart well or at all.</a> Often, this is due to a chart technicality affecting the signature song, as Arlo Guthrie, the Rembrandts, and Fastball have seen. When the artist's best-known hit is in a markedly different style than the rest of their work, that's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">Black Sheep Hit</a>.

<ul><li> <strong>Elvin Bishop</strong> is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, but as a solo artist, he is known almost entirely for his 1976 hit "Fooled Around and Fell in Love", which reached #3 on the Hot 100. While Bishop wrote the lyrics and played lead guitar on the recording, he believed his gritty voice wasn't a good match for the song. Instead, the lead vocals were handled by future Jefferson Starship singer Mickey Thomas.
</li><li> <strong>J.J. Cale</strong> had only one top 40 hit in his career with 1972's "Crazy Mama". Overall, he's better known for writing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton">Eric Clapton</a> classics "Cocaine" and "After Midnight".
</li><li> <strong>Delbert McClinton</strong> is a true rarity, as he managed to be a one-hit wonder on three different charts with three different songs. First, he hit #8 on the pop charts in 1980 with the blues-rock song "Givin' It Up for Your Love". Then he got to #13 on Mainstream Rock Tracks in 1992 with "Every Time I Roll the Dice"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ovi3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ovi3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ovi3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which barely made Top 40 in Canada as well</span>. <em>Then</em> he got to #4 on the country charts in 1993 as a duet partner on Tanya Tucker's "Tell Me About It". He remained a fairly popular artist regardless, having written Emmylou Harris's 1978 hit "Two More Bottles of Wine" in addition to winning a handful of Grammys.
</li><li> <strong>Alannah Myles</strong>, though she had another Top 40 hit afterward in the US, is mainly known only for her late-1989 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> tribute song "Black Velvet", a #1 smash on the Hot 100 that was also a Top 10 hit in many other countries. Myles charted several more times in her native Canada (including 1992's "Song Instead of a Kiss", which topped the Canadian charts), but never saw the US charts again after "Black Velvet". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AtlanticRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AtlanticRecords">Atlantic Records</a> simultaneously released a soundalike version by <strong>Robin Lee</strong> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> format, which proved to be <em>her</em> only hit there; however, Lee has had somewhat more success as a songwriter.
</li><li> Boston band <strong>Treat Her Right</strong> scored a #15 hit on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart in 1988 with "I Think She Likes Me". It was the group's only chart entry. They're better known nowadays as the first major group led by singer Mark Sandman, who later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout">became much better known</a> as the frontman for the acclaimed alt-rock trio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Morphine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Morphine">Morphine</a>.
</li><li> Blues-rock singer <strong>Beth Hart</strong> scored a #88 Hot 100 hit in 1999 with "LA Song (Out of This Town)". The song also made the top 10 on the Adult Top 40 chart and was a #1 hit in New Zealand. Although that was it for Hart as a singles artist, she has maintained a following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">in western Europe</a>, with several of her albums charting well in Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/POD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/POD">P.O.D.</a></strong>'s "Youth of the Nation," a song inspired by the Columbine and Satana High School shootings, was their only hit on mainstream charts, reaching #28 on the Hot 100 in 2001. They narrowly missed having another Top 40 hit with their song "Alive" that same year: It peaked at #41. Although "Nation" was their only Top 40 hit, they're now remembered outside of the rock radio format as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder">Two-Hit Wonder</a> for both it and "Alive".
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SixpenceNoneTheRicher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SixpenceNoneTheRicher">Sixpence None the Richer</a></strong> reached #2 with their 1998 hit "Kiss Me" thanks to its appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShesAllThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShesAllThat">She's All That</a></em>. Their next single, a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLas">The La's</a> "There She Goes", peaked at #32 on the Hot 100, but it managed to go Top-10 on the AC charts. The band had one more noteworthy adult contemporary hit, "Breathe Your Name" in 2002, but it did not cross over to the pop charts. All their other followup singles flopped and are completely forgotten today.
</li><li> <strong>dc Talk</strong> were one of the biggest names in Christian music in the late '80s and early '90s and won four Grammy awards over the course of their career. But only one of their songs ever crossed over to the non-religious charts: "Just Between You and Me", a Top 30 hit on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart in 1996.
</li><li> Christian new wave singer Leslie Phillips had a ton of Christian chart hits in the mid-'80s, but by the end of the decade, she had transitioned into a secular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a> career by signing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginRecords">Virgin Records</a> and changing her stage name to <strong>Sam Phillips</strong> (her childhood nickname). Despite critical acclaim for several of her secular albums (she is also the composer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em>), she only scored one chart single on the Billboard Alternative chart: "Holding On To The Earth", which made it to #22 in 1989.

However, pretty much every pre-schooler and young boy in Italy knows the song "I due liocorni" ("The Two Unicorns") which became a classic for kids in kindergartens, scout camps, summer camps and so on, so much so that it's considered some kind of traditional folk classic while in fact it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">written in 1978</a>. It's never credited to the original composers and the religious undertones (it's about the animals that Noah brought on the Ark) are downplayed. The song was also translated in <a class="urllink" href="https://itunes.apple.com/ch/album/i-due-liocorni-international/id1159386416?l=it">several languages<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and, while not really popular outside of Italy, it's still several hundred times more known than anything else Zafra did.
</li><li> <strong>Ocean</strong> is known almost exclusively for their 1970 gospel-pop song "Put Your Hand in the Hand". They had a few more minor hits in their native Canada, but nothing else left much of an impact there either.

<ul><li> <strong>Jimmy Boyd</strong> had a novelty hit in 1952 with the Christmas classic "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus". Between its novelty stigma and the fact that Boyd was 13 at the time, the song cannibalized his career. He had a moderately successful acting career afterwards but never captured the stardom he had with his megahit.
</li><li> <strong>Elmo &amp; Patsy</strong> had a Christmas classic with "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer", first released in 1979, but nearly anyone would be hard-pressed to name any other release. Interestingly, Patsy isn't even on that song, so it's often just credited to <strong>Dr. Elmo</strong>. Despite its popularity (so popular that it even spawned an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GrandmaGotRunOverByAReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GrandmaGotRunOverByAReindeer">animated special</a>), it never entered the Hot 100 until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, and its highest peak on <em>any</em> chart was a mere #48 on Hot Country Songs in 1999. In Canada, the higher-charting version was a #20-peaking release by the Irish Rovers in 1982.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffFoxworthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffFoxworthy">Jeff Foxworthy</a></strong>: Although the comedian best known for his "you might be a redneck" one-liners released several "songs" that included snippets of his comedy set to music, usually with a chorus from a country music singer, the only one that entered the country music top 40 was "Redneck 12 Days of Christmas", a half-song, half-recitation that he performed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloDuet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloDuet">Solo Duet</a>. (And unlike the others, it didn't "sample" existing standup work of his for the verses.) It also set a record for the highest-charting Christmas song on the country charts<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2yijv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2yijv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2yijv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">later tied by Jimmy Wayne's "Paper Angels"</span>.
</li><li> Before he became better known as the original voice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Donatello</a>, <strong>Barry Gordon</strong> had a #6 hit in 1955 with "Nuttin' For Christmas". He was only 6 at the time.
</li><li> <strong>Bobby Helms</strong> will forever be known as the guy who did "Jingle Bell Rock". His other big hits "My Special Angel" and "Fraulein" have fallen into obscurity.
</li><li> <strong>NewSong</strong>: "The Christmas Shoes" was a huge crossover hit (#1 AC, #42 pop, #31 Country), and they've been pretty silent outside their usual Contemporary Christian demographic ever since. Interestingly, a cover of "The Christmas Shoes" was <em>also</em> the only Top 40 country hit for the short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Group</a> <strong>3 of Hearts</strong> one year later.
</li><li> <strong>Gayla Peevey</strong> had her only hit in 1953 with "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas", which reached #24 on the Hot 100 when she was 10. She had a few later singles under her real name of Jamie Horton, but none were successful.
</li><li> <strong>MC Einar</strong> was a pioneer of Danish hip-hop in the Eighties, but is almost only remembered for his Christmas hit <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/orHhn4zll7w">Jul, Det' Cool<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, where he raps a sarcastic text about the commercialization, repetitiveness and forced <em>hygge</em> of Danish Christmas over a sampling of Leroy Anderson's <em>Sleigh Ride</em>. Sadly Einar never made any money from the song; it was intended for a one-time joke performance only, so he signed over the rights to Leroy Anderson's estate before the song became popular.
</li><li> <strong>Song Trust</strong>, a project spearheaded by defunct independent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> label Giantslayer Records (which was owned by songwriters Rory Lee Feek and Tim Johnson), released a Christmas single under that name in late 2007. That song, "Bring Him Home Santa", was sung by an anonymous six-year-old girl, and proceeds from singles sales went to St. Jude's. Although other "Song Trust" material was released, none of it charted. Giantslayer folded in 2009 as Johnson died and Feek focused more on his work with his wife, Joey Martin Feek, in their duo Joey + Rory.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TransSiberianOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TransSiberianOrchestra">Trans-Siberian Orchestra</a></strong> are a hugely successful album and touring act, but they've just had one major singles chart entry, with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> "Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)". The prog-metal medley of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" and "Carol of the Bells" made it to #25 on the adult contemporary chart, #29 on the Mainstream Rock chart and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It also charted at #49 on Billboard Radio Songs, a feeder chart into the Billboard Hot 100, but didn't make the Hot 100 proper. They've had a few other adult contemporary chart hits, but they've never had another song that's reached widespread popularity the way that "Sarajevo" has... though their 2004 track "Wizards in Winter" is well-known as the backing music for a massively memetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> video of a Christmas light show created by a Cincinnati-area engineer in 2005.
</li><li> <strong>Vince Vance &amp; the Valiants</strong> are known almost entirely for "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (not to be confused with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey">Mariah Carey</a> song), which is one of the most-played Christmas songs in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> genre. They got a tiny bit of buzz beforehand for their "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">Barbara Ann</a>" parody "Bomb Iran" in 1980, but they are not the only act to have done a parody of that name.

<ul><li> 18th-century Italian composer <strong>Tomaso Albinoni</strong> has the dubious honour of being considered a one-hit wonder for a piece he didn't even write. "Albinoni's Adagio in G minor", frequently used as the background music for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> scenes in films and television, was in fact written in the 1950s by Italian composer Remo Giazotto, who claimed to have based the work on a manuscript fragment recovered in 1945 but could offer no proof of this claim.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3to1p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3to1p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3to1p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Whether or not he was telling the truth remains a matter of contention.</span> The Adagio therefore qualifies Giazotto as a one-hit wonder rather than Albinoni (whose works are mostly known only by Baroque music enthusiasts).
</li><li> You don't know who <strong>Euphemia Allen</strong> is, but if you ever took piano classes, chances are you were taught to play <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/JM5fjgiFrxg">Chopsticks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. This little waltz song was her only work, which she composed in 1877, at the age of 16, under the pseudonym Arthur de Lulli.
</li><li> Although American composer <strong>Samuel Barber</strong> is moderately well-known in the classical community for his violin concerto and Symphony No.1, he is mostly remembered for the Adagio for Strings, which started life as the slow movement of his String Quartet in B minor. To put into perspective how much the Adagio has overshadowed its parent work, there are over 250 recordings of various settings of the Adagio (mostly the string orchestra version, but the choral setting, using as its text the "Agnus Dei" from the Catholic Mass, is also frequently performed and recorded), and just over a dozen of the complete string quartet.
</li><li> <strong>Luigi Boccherini</strong> is mostly remembered solely for the Minuet in A major from his String Quintet in E major, Op. 11 No. 5, used prominently in such films as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLadykillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLadykillers">The Ladykillers</a></em> among others.
</li><li> If you have heard anything by <strong>Alfredo Catalani</strong> it is most likely the soprano aria <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/kYUYbCksb">"Ebben? Ne andrò lontana"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em>Le Wally</em>, which was featured prominently in Jean-Jacques Beineix's 1981 thriller <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Diva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Diva">Diva</a></em>.
</li><li> Like his compatriot and contemporary Mouret, <strong>Marc-Antoine Charpentier</strong> is mostly known for a fanfare that has been adopted as a theme by a broadcasting organisation: the opening <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/iwU37osOkQA">Prelude (Marche en rondeau)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from his <em>Te Deum</em> in D major, used as the theme of the European Broadcasting Union and played before broadcasts of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, <em>Jeux Sans Frontières</em>, and any other programmes simultaneously broadcast across Europe by the EBU. Though he was very prolific, his other works are primarily known only to Baroque enthusiasts.
</li><li> British composer <strong>Jeremiah Clarke</strong>, active around the turn of the 18th century, is today remembered mostly for writing the <em>Prince of Denmark's March</em>, nowadays a popular wedding tune and usually known incorrectly as <em>Trumpet Voluntary</em>. Making matters worse for him, it was long incorrectly attributed to Henry Purcell.
</li><li> Today, French composer <strong>Paul Dukas</strong> is remembered mostly for writing <em>The Sorcerer's Apprentice</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em> fame, although the fact that he was a fanatical perfectionist and destroyed or abandoned many compositions after he became dissatisfied with them means there is not much other music by which to remember him.
</li><li> <strong>Julius Fucik</strong> is only remembered for his <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/_B0CyOAO8y0">Entry of the Gladiators<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">standard</a> circus music.
</li><li> The Danish composer <strong>Jacob Gade</strong> is only known for one work, the world-famous <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/7mTEh5awKGQ">Tango Jalousie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. Given that the royalties made him financially independent and allowed him to set up a handsome scholarship for young talented Danish musicians, he probably didn't mind much.
</li><li> <strong>Benjamin Godard</strong> and his <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/rVGsKhyK5Wo">Lullaby (Angels Guard Thee)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, a popular tenor hit, originally from his opera <em>Jocelyn</em>.
</li><li> <strong>Gustav Holst</strong>'s most famous work by far is the great orchestral suite <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Isic2Z2e2xs">The Planets<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. It overshadowed his other compositions to the point where he himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">came to resent it</a> and flat-out refused to write an extra movement when Pluto was discovered in 1930.
</li><li> <strong>Engelbert Humperdinck</strong> (the composer, not the singer) scored a great success with his first opera, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HanselAndGretel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HanselAndGretel">Hansel and Gretel</a></em>. None of his later operas were anywhere near as successful, though the now-forgotten fairy-tale opera <em>Königskinder</em> was somewhat known in its day.
</li><li> <strong>Ruggero Leoncavallo</strong>'s only well-known work is the two-act opera <em>Pagliacci</em>, which is often paired with <em>Cavalleria Rusticana</em> in a one-hit wonder double bill. (The song "Mattinata" is relatively well known, as it was written for and a favorite of Caruso.), In fact, Leoncavallo is mainly known not just for the opera, but for <em>one moment</em> in it (the aria "Vesti la giubba").
</li><li> The prolific composer, pianist and music publisher <strong>Henry Charles Litolff</strong> is today known mainly for his still existing music publishing business <em>Collection Litolff</em> - and for the bubbly <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/aIX1Q4kT17s">scherzo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from his Concerto Symphonique No. 4 in D minor.
</li><li> <strong>Pietro Mascagni</strong> is really only well-known for his one-act opera <em>Cavalleria Rusticana</em> (<em>Rustic Chivalry</em>), which was also one of his first major works.
</li><li> Most of the works of French Baroque composer <strong>Jean-Joseph Mouret</strong> are not performed today. At least in the U.S., he's mainly known for the opening Fanfare-Rondeau from his first <em>Suite de symphonies</em>, used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS">PBS</a> as the theme for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Masterpiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Masterpiece">Masterpiece</a></em> series (and also a popular wedding tune).
</li><li> <strong>Leopold Mozart</strong>, the father of the more famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>, was an acknowledged musician and composer in his own right, but today only his <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/NhTGbp6ta5Y">Toy Symphony<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is played regularly. Worse, it was for many years incorrectly attributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JosephHaydn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JosephHaydn">Joseph Haydn</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Otto Nicolai</strong> was a popular opera composer in his days, but only his last opera, <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor</em> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerryWivesOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerryWivesOfWindsor">Shakespeare</a>, is performed today, mainly in Germany. Outside the German-speaking world only the <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/wSadbV70__I">overture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is sometimes heard. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4m0r1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4m0r1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4m0r1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Nicolai's greatest contribution to music history might be the opera he <em>didn't</em> write: in 1841 he was offered an opera text by Merelli, the impresario of the La Scala Opera in Milan, but he rejected it for being too grisly. Merelli then sought out a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiuseppeVerdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiuseppeVerdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>, who had just decided to give up composing after flopping with his second opera <em>King for a Day</em>, and more or less bullied him into setting the text to music. The opera, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Nabucco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Nabucco">Nebuchadnezzar</a></em>, was a colossal hit, and Verdi went on to become perhaps the greatest Italian Opera composer ever.</span>
</li><li> <strong>Carl Orff</strong> is known mainly for one work, his cantata <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana">Carmina Burana</a></em> - after its premier Orff himself told his publisher, "Everything I have written before can be destroyed." Indeed, he's known mainly for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> from this, the opening (and closing) cantus "Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi: O Fortuna", although "Gassenhauer" is also pretty well-known.
</li><li> <strong>Johann Pachelbel</strong>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PachelbelsCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PachelbelsCanon">Canon in D major</a> is perhaps one of the most famous and frequently performed classical works. Though some of his organ works are popular with organists, the overwhelming majority of the general population, if they know him at all, only know the Canon.
</li><li> <strong>Christian Petzold</strong> is known only for his <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0V0r89DMfk">Minuet in G<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which, until the 1970s, was incorrectly attributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>. A good part of that piece's fame comes from it being adapted into "A Lover's Concerto", a 1965 hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Group</a> The Toys.
</li><li> The only thing <strong>Amilcare Ponchielli</strong> is remembered for is "The Dance of the Hours" from his opera <em>La Gioconda</em>, which was both used in the original 1940 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em> and adapted by comedy singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllanSherman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllanSherman">Allan Sherman</a> for his 1963 song "Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh".
</li><li> <strong>Emil von Reznicek</strong> wrote a multitude of works in almost every classical genre, but the only piece of his that is regularly played today is the cheerful overture to his comical opera <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/2QAszol-yoo">Donna Diana<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.
</li><li> <strong>Juventino Rosas</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">died when he was only twenty-six</a> and of a handful of works he wrote, most people would only know <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/zX8Uk5ly-As">Sobre las Olas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Author <strong>Claude Joseph Rouget</strong>, called <strong>Rouget de Lisle</strong>, wrote plays, songs, essays and so on, but with so little success that he ended up in debtor's prison for a time and his works are now forgotten. Yet there are many streets named after him, monuments were erected in his honour, and his body was transferred to the Dôme des Invalides. All because of one song he wrote and of which few people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondVerseCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondVerseCurse">remember more than the first verse</a>. It is entitled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">War Song for the Army of the Rhine</a></em>, but became famous as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalAnthem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalAnthem">La Marseillaise</a></em>.

</li><li> The only known compositions by <strong>Paul de Schlözer</strong> is two small pieces for piano, one of which, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/DjjJ9xGb-7I">Etude de concert Op. 1 No. 2 in A flat minor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, is a brilliant and extremely difficult piece, that is often played as an encore. This, and the fact that very little is known about de Schlözer and his life, has given rise to the story that de Schlözer did not write the piece himself, but won the manuscript from the more well-known pianist and composer Moritz Moszkowski in a card game.
</li><li> <strong>Johann Strauss Senior</strong> suffered a fate similar to Leopold Mozart above, being a talented and popular composer whose memory has been completely overshadowed by a more talented son. He is almost exclusively known today for his <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/3XjQ7ssv9ag">Radetzky-Marsch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, which is always played at the end of the Vienna Philharmonic's New Years Day Concert.
</li><li> The dance music of <strong>Émile Waldteufel</strong> is not entirely unknown, but his most well-known piece by far is <em><a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/zirn3M3ewQc">The Skater's Waltz<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, a longtime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> in film and television for winter landscapes and skating.
</li><li> Although the works of French composer <strong>Charles-Marie Widor</strong> are popular with organists, most listeners probably only know the concluding Toccata from his Organ Symphony No.5 in F minor, Op. 42 No. 1, a popular recessional.
</li><li> <strong>Mason Williams</strong> was a talented comedy writer who wrote many of the most memorable sketches on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSmothersBrothersComedyHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSmothersBrothersComedyHour">The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour</a></em> and was briefly the head writer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>. He was also a talented classical guitarist, and he showcased those skills on his lone hit in 1968, "Classical Gas".

I Love You)" peaked at #1 on the UK singles chart and Irish charts in December 1998. <em>Say everybody, have you seen my Balls?</em>
</li><li> <strong>The Joe Dolce Music Theatre</strong>: "Shaddup You Face" became a million-selling number one in many countries, but nothing else he made could even chart, let alone become a major hit. The song is now particularly infamous because it kept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ultravox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ultravox">Ultravox</a>'s much-acclaimed new wave ballad "Vienna" from reaching #1 in the UK.

The only such recording that was a real hit was "Here's Your Sign (Get the Picture)", which remixed a series of "here's your sign" jokes off his debut album with a sung chorus by non-one-hit wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisTritt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisTritt">Travis Tritt</a>. The single peaked at #29 on the country charts and #43 on the Hot 100, representing his only big hit (although "Here's Your Sign Christmas", a parody of "Jingle Bells" with original comedy bits, got some seasonal airplay).
</li><li> Comedian and late-night talk show host <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyFallon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmyFallon">Jimmy Fallon</a></strong> is well known for his musical comedy, but he's only had one bonafide chart hit to his name: "Ew!", a collaboration with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackEyedPeas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackEyedPeas">will.i.am</a> that made it to #26 on the Hot 100 shortly after he introduced it on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">The Tonight Show</a></em> in October 2014.

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodies">The Goodies</a></strong>: They had a string of comedy hit singles in the 1970s that were a natural spin-off from their TV comedy show. What makes them a one-hit wonder is the fact that their first single, "(Do, Do, Do) The Funky Gibbon", a parody of disco dance crazes, was initially taken as a straight song in the USA and made it into the lower reaches of the Dance and Disco charts... before they realized... it remains the boys' only American chart success.
</li><li> <strong>Dickie Goodman</strong> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer">Record Producer</a> known for creating the "break-in" style of novelty recordings, wherein voice actors pose comedic questions that are "answered" through snippets of songs. Considered an early form of sampling, the technique was codified with Goodman's 1956 debut release "The Flying Saucer", where he and songwriter Bill Buchanan recount a flying saucer encounter through snippets of then-contemporary songs. Goodman continued to record well into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> in this style but was never able to fully replicate the success of his debut.

</li><li> <strong>Larry Groce</strong>, who is primarily a country, folk, and children's music singer, had a #9 hit in 1976 with the novelty song "Junk Food Junkie".
</li><li> <strong>Screamin' Jay Hawkins</strong> is technically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder">No-Hit Wonder</a>, but his 1956 song "I Put a Spell on You" has become a rock and roll classic. Since it's the only song of his still remembered today, he is often considered a one-hit wonder.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens">Ray Stevens</a> is by no means a one-hit wonder, with multiple successful songs in both country and pop. But as <strong>The Henhouse Five Plus Too</strong>, he had his only Top 40 hit doing a cover of "In the Mood" entirely in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluckingFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluckingFunny">chicken clucks</a>.

Despite this, the song is probably one of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement">less remembered songs</a> today, especially when compared to singles that didn't make the Top 40 like "I'm On a Boat", "Jack Sparrow" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegoMovie">Everything is Awesome</a>".

The song peaked at #32 on the Billboard alternative chart and was an even bigger hit in the UK, where it made it all the way to #10.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveMartin">Steve Martin</a></strong> has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s, and has had some success in the bluegrass scene.

Like many of the artists in this category, he's better known for his contributions outside the music scene, namely, for composing the theme tunes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse">Danger Mouse</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula">Count Duckula</a></em>.

The recording was basically one long spoken-word sketch held together by a chorus sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Geddy Lee</a>. While both Moranis and Thomas subsequently had long and successful film careers, neither reached the pop charts again, in or out of character.
</li><li> <strong>Morris Minor and the Majors</strong>: Their only big hit was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys">Beastie Boys</a> parody "Stutter Rap (No Sleep Til Bedtime)". The followup, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StockAitkenWaterman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StockAitkenWaterman">Stock Aitken Waterman</a> parody called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeName">This Is The Chorus</a>", did less well. In his book <em>One Hit Wonderland</em>, former member Tony Hawks explains that the first record sold to kids who wanted to wind up older siblings who listened to the Beastie Boys. The second record made fun of the music that said kids actually listened to, so it flopped. The group then had their own BBC sitcom, <em>Morris Minor's Marvellous Motors</em>, but it suffered from low ratings and only lasted one season.
<ul><li> The aforementioned <em>One Hit Wonderland</em> book charts Hawks' - who had become famous in the meantime for his comedic travel books - attempts to have a second hit. He succeeded...sort of. He wrote a tune called "Big in Albania", and roped in composer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimRice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimRice">Tim Rice</a> and comedian Norman Wisdom (who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">beloved in Albania</a>) to perform the song with him. For his troubles, Hawks was rewarded with a #18 hit in Albania in 2002. Humorously, for all his work, that only made him a one-hit wonder in two different countries with different songs, since "Stutter Rap" never charted in Albania.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MrBlobby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MrBlobby">Mr Blobby</a></strong> from the TV show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoelsHouseParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoelsHouseParty">Noel's House Party</a></em> had a UK Christmas number-one single with his eponymous song, beating out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TakeThatBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TakeThatBand">Take That</a> for the spot, despite being dubbed one of the worst number 1 singles of all time. He did have a number 36 hit two years later with "Christmas in Blobbyland", but in hindsight, he is seen as a one-hit wonder.

Not only couldn't he score another hit, but the song didn't even have a proper flipside. Instead, it was just "!aaaH-Ah ,yawA eM ekaT ot gnimoC er'yehT", which was just the song played backwards.

</li><li> <strong>Pinkfong</strong> is a South Korean children's entertainment company that releases kids' media in several different languages. One of said songs, a rendition of the campfire song "Baby Shark", went viral and charted within top 40 of the Hot 100 in 2019. Given the unique circumstances, it is unlikely that they will ever chart again.
</li><li> <strong>General Larry Platt</strong> made headlines in 2010 when he auditioned on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> with his unconventional self-penned composition "Pants on the Ground". The 62-year-old Platt was decades over the age limit for the show, and the response from the judges to the song was... mixed, to say the least. The song nonetheless became a meme; Platt soon released a version through rapper Mims' record label, and it reached #46 on the Hot 100. After "Pants on the Ground" faded from public consciousness, Platt never released another song.
</li><li> <strong>The Rabbit Joint</strong> are a rock band whose only claim to fame is a novelty song about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>.</em> It is commonly considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SystemOfADown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SystemOfADown">System of a Down</a> song due to the Serj Tankian soundalike lead singer. When it turned out that it <em>wasn't</em> by them, interest in the group vanished.
</li><li> Rap trio <strong>Sporty Thievz</strong> had a #12 Hot 100 hit in 1999 with "No Pigeons", a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TLC">TLC</a>'s hit "No Scrubs". Their followup, a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild">Destiny's Child</a>'s "Bills, Bills, Bills" called "Can't Pay Your Bills" did not chart. In 2001, group member Marlon Bryant was killed by a drunk driver, and the group effectively stopped after his death.
</li><li> Comedian <strong>Johnny Standley</strong> had a #1 hit in 1952 with "It's In The Book", a comedic analysis of <em>Little Bo-Peep</em>. It was his one and only recording to ever chart.

They had no further hits.
</li><li> Despite an influential career as a folk singer, <strong>Loudon Wainwright III</strong> had exactly one chart entry, with 1973's "Dead Skunk". Surprisingly, the song isn't even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">Black Sheep Hit</a> because he always had the propensity for throwing novelty songs onto his records.
</li><li> <strong>Sheb Wooley</strong> only had a single Top 40 hit on the Hot 100, when his novelty tune "Purple People Eater" topped the chart in 1958. Outside of that chart, he's been very successful in other areas: He had a #1 hit on the country chart in 1962 with "That's My Pa", and later in the decade, had a string of country hits under the name Ben Colder with parodies of other songs. He also had a long career as a Western actor, and had a supporting role on the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rawhide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rawhide">Rawhide</a></em>. That's also his voice on the deathless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockScream">Wilhelm Scream</a> sound effect, recorded during the filming of the 1951 film <em>Distant Drums</em>.

In 2013, the duo released the single "The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)" and saw it become a surprise viral hit around the world, including #17 in the UK, #6 in the US and #1 in Norway. Their followup single "Trucker's Hitch" only charted in Norway, and the duo has mostly focused on their television career since then.

The series had aired its last episode two years beforehand, but the cast reunited and collaborated with Richard - who was a running gag on the show, which was named after another of his hits - for the Comic Relief charity. The cast scored no further hits together.
<ul><li> Nigel Planer, in the guise of <strong>Neil</strong>, his hippie character from <em>The Young Ones</em>, reached #2 in the UK in 1984 with a cover of Traffic's psychedelic classic "Hole in My Shoe". The song's success was helped by both the popularity of the show at the time and Planer's self-aware appearance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopOfThePops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopOfThePops">Top of the Pops</a></em>. The character's next single was another psychedelic-era cover, this time Tomorrow's "My White Bicycle", but it only reached #97.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>John Zacherle</strong>, a famous television personality known for hosting a popular block of horror movies in the New York City and Philadelphia markets. He had a top ten novelty hit in 1958 with "Dinner With Drac". Although Zacherle released a few more horror-themed novelty singles and album, none of them charted.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a></strong> scored his only US Top 40 hit in 1982 with the #32 novelty song "Valley Girl", a duet with his daughter <strong>Moon Zappa</strong> that was also her only chart entry ever. Zappa is one of the best known and most commonly cited examples of a specific type of one-hit wonder: A legendary artist who notched just one pop hit, even though they are known for much more than that one song. Zappa was famous for his cult following, and he was even a well-known media personality for much of his life, and he did way better as an album artist and touring act instead of one reliant on singles. Apart from "Valley Girl", Zappa's only Hot 100 entries were "Don't Eat the Yellow Snow", which made #86 in 1974, and "Dancin' Fool", a #45 hit in 1979.

Foster did enjoy more success on the adult contemporary charts, and in his native Canada, but he has made his greatest mark as a songwriter, arranger, and especially producer, with a total of 16 Grammys in those roles.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesHorner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesHorner">James Horner</a></strong> was one of the most highly regarded and best-known film composers of the 1980s, '90s, and 2000s.

Horner never made the pop charts again after this.
</li><li> Austrian musician <strong>Anton Karas</strong> had an enormous hit in 1950 with the "Harry Lime Theme" from the film noir <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThirdMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThirdMan">The Third Man</a></em>, a single release of which reached #1 in the US and became the first record to sell half a million copies. His other compositions are almost completely unknown outside a few devoted zither players.

As performed by the <strong>London Symphony Orchestra</strong>, the single version got to #10 on the Hot 100. The LSO charted a second time with the main <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie">Superman: The Movie</a></em> theme, but it only got to #81. The LSO remains one of the world's most respected symphony orchestras and still regularly record film scores, but they haven't touched the pop charts as a billed artist since the 1970s.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HansZimmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HansZimmer">Hans Zimmer</a></strong> is an Oscar-winning film composer and a pioneer of electronic music. While he's had several hit albums with his film score soundtracks, he's only had one major chart single as a lead artist. "Spider-Pig", an offbeat 1-minute long choral piece he composed with arranger Michael A. Levine (uncredited on the single) for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie">The Simpsons Movie</a></em>, made it to #23 in the UK and #8 in New Zealand, and is the shortest song to ever make the Top 40 in either country. He's had a few low charting hits on the UK charts with some other film score excerpts, but none have come anywhere close to the Top 40.

<ul><li> <strong>Gale Garnett</strong>, a folk singer born in New Zealand and raised in Canada, had only one hit with the Grammy-winning "We'll Sing in the Sunshine", a #1 AC and #4 pop hit in 1964.
</li><li> <strong>The Lumineers</strong> 2012/2013 hit "Ho Hey" reached #3 in the U.S. They haven't made the Top 40 since. They've been luckier as an album and genre chart band: Their debut album went platinum and its follow-up topped the album charts. In 2016, their song "Ophelia", which made it to only #66 on the Hot 100, was named <a class="urllink" href="http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2016/alternative-songs">the top song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for the year on the Billboard Alternative chart.

His follow up "Dreams of You" cracked the top 40 a year later, but stalled at #36.
</li><li> British singer-songwriter <strong>Passenger</strong> (yes, it's just one guy) managed to cross the pond with the #5 smash hit "Let Her Go". He hasn't yet had another big hit in Europe, let alone North America. He can at least take comfort in his performance somewhat further South, though, with a couple of albums doing pretty well in Australia and New Zealand; "Anywhere" even reached #6 on the NZ charts.
</li><li> <strong>Peter Sarstedt</strong>, with "Where Do You Go To, My Lovely" in 1969, as shown <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/L8XQZYIiNgo">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Follow-up "Frozen Orange Juice" did crack the top 10 later that year, but was not the hit its predecessor was.

The song was a crossover smash in Canada, reaching #1 on the country and AC charts, and #3 on <em>RPM</em> Top Singles. While she had a few other chart entries, most of them are very obscure now.
</li><li> Danish guitarist <strong>Jorgen Ingmann</strong> is best known for his 1961 crossover hit "Apache" — and being one-half of the winning duo of the 1963 Eurovision contest.
</li><li> Peter, Paul, and Mary are not one-hit wonders, but <strong>Paul Stookey</strong> was as a soloist with his hit "The Wedding Song".
</li><li> <strong>Barry McGuire</strong> is known almost entirely for his 1965 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong">Protest Song</a> "Eve of Destruction". McGuire became a born-again Christian in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> and recorded a few albums of Christian music.
</li><li> Although <strong>George Ezra</strong> is incredibly popular in his native U.K., his presence on the American charts was restricted to "Budapest".
</li><li> <strong>The Brothers Four</strong>, a folk-rock quartet from Seattle, had a #2 hit with "Greenfields" and no other major hits.
</li><li> <strong>The Village Stompers</strong>, a group from Greenwich Village who played what was described as "folk-dixie", had a number of hits in 1963-1965, but are today only known for "Washington Square", a #2 hit on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 and a #1 on the Adult Contemporary charts in September 1963.

His follow-up stalled in the '30s and he never charted again.
</li><li> <strong>Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler</strong> had a huge crossover in 1966 with "The Ballad of the Green Berets", a patriotic song that was obviously drawn from his real-life experience as a soldier in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a>. It was a 5-week #1 smash on the Hot 100 and the biggest pop hit of 1966, as well as a #1 Easy Listening and #2 country hit. He charted only one other single, "The 'A' Team", but it has since been forgotten. Sadler later became a novelist before dying of a gunshot wound.
</li><li> <strong>Asaf Avidan and the Mojos</strong> are a popular folk act in their native Israel, but their only hit outside of it was a 2012 remix of their 2008 song "One Day/Reckoning Song".
</li><li> Finnish group <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Loituma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Loituma">Loituma</a></strong> became this thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>. Their version of the Finnish folk classic "Ievan Polkka" ("Eva's Polka") from their self-titled 1995 album became a huge meme back in 2006 thanks to a random Russian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> user, who combined the scatting portion of the song with a brief looping clip taken from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>. So, "Leekspin" was born. Loituma even released a new single with the English title "Ieva's Polka" in 2006 to capitalize on the fad, but since the craze died down nobody cared anymore about them outside of Finland.
</li><li> While there are many British artists who are stars in their home country, but only managed one hit in America, the reverse is true too. One such example of this is <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnDenver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnDenver">John Denver</a></strong>. In his native United States, Denver was one of the biggest music stars of the 1970s, with four #1 singles and a series of gold or platinum albums. Across the Atlantic in the UK, however, he only had one top 40 single: "Annie's Song", which went to #1 there in 1974. After that, he only had one other song ever hit the UK charts, when "Perhaps Love", a collaboration with famed opera tenor Plácido Domingo, made it to #46 in 1981. Several of his other songs, including "Leaving on a Jet Plane" and "Take Me Home, Country Roads", have since become more well-known in the UK <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">following his death</a>.
</li><li> Canadian folk-pop group <strong>Walk Off the Earth</strong> had an international hit in 2012 when their cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gotye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gotye">Gotye</a>'s "Somebody That I Used to Know" went viral - driven by its gimmick of five band members playing the song on the same guitar at the same time. The cover's novelty didn't translate into a career: While followup "Red Hands" was a minor hit on American adult alternative radio, the only other chart action they've seen since are a couple of low-charting singles on the Canadian Hot 100.
</li><li> The country and folk duo <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCivilWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCivilWars">The Civil Wars</a></strong> were one of the most buzzed-about bands of the early 2010s; Their 2011 debut album <em>Barton Hollow</em> was critically acclaimed, went Gold and won them two awards at the 2012 Grammys. While they were riding high on the success of the album, they got a Top 40 pop hit in early 2012 through a feature credit on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan">Big Name Fan</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>'s song "Safe &amp; Sound". But then the band's career came to a screeching halt: Due to creative and personal conflicts between its two members, the group effectively broke up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">while recording their self-titled second album</a>. "Safe &amp; Sound" ultimately wound up being their only entry onto the Billboard Hot 100, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement">despite not being as well known</a> as anything off their actual albums.
</li><li> Canadian folk singer <strong>Indio</strong> scored a top ten hit on both the Canadian pop chart and the American alternative chart with his 1989 debut single "Hard Sun", which featured no less of an icon than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell">Joni Mitchell</a> on backing vocals. Then, just as the song was at the peak of its popularity, Indio more or less dropped off the face of the Earth. He had become disillusioned by the music industry and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">never recorded another album</a>. The next time he popped up was in 2009 when he sued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Eddie Vedder</a> for changing the lyrics to "Hard Sun" in his cover version for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWild">Into the Wild</a></em> soundtrack.
</li><li> <strong>Bruce Cockburn</strong> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTroPay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTroPay">pronounced "Co-burn"</a>) is highly regarded in the folk music world for his guitar playing and songwriting and has racked up several hits in his native Canada. Below the border in America, however, he's only had one hit single: 1979's "Wondering Where the Lions Are", which made it to #21.
</li><li> <strong>The Irish Rovers</strong> have recorded for more than 50 years, but they only made an impact with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShelSilverstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShelSilverstein">Shel Silverstein</a>-penned "The Unicorn" in 1968. In Canada, they were slightly more successful with "Wasn't That a Party", credited as just <strong>The Rovers</strong>, but success was limited after that.
</li><li> South African folk quintet <strong>Four Jacks and a Jill</strong> took their song "Master Jack" to #18 on the US pop chart in 1968. Their followup "Mister Nico" topped out at #98 and they never made the Hot 100 again, although they did have a few more Top 20 hits in South Africa.
</li><li> <strong>The Springfields</strong> had several hits in their native UK, but just one became a hit across the Atlantic in the United States, when "Silver Threads and Golden Needles" made it to #20 in 1962. Interestingly, it failed to chart back home in Britain. A few years later, member Dusty Springfield left the band to start her own solo career and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout">became a 1960s pop music icon</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Todd Snider</strong>'s only chart hit came in 1993 with "Talkin' Seattle Grunge Rock Blues", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>-esque talking blues novelty tune about a grunge band that becomes huge when they decide to become "the only band that wouldn't play a note, under any circumstance." Despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack">Hidden Track</a>, the song caught on with rock radio stations that played the very same bands it was lampooning and reached #31 on the Mainstream Rock Chart in late 1994. After that, Snider went back to his cult following. Two other tracks off the same album as "Blues" were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singers: "Alright Guy" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryAllan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryAllan">Gary Allan</a>, and "Trouble" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkChesnutt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkChesnutt">Mark Chesnutt</a>.
</li><li> <strong>The Spokesmen</strong> had a Hot 100 hit with "Dawn of Correction", their conservative, Vietnam War-defending answer to Barry McGuire's "Eve of Destruction". Like McGuire, it would be their only hit. Their cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> "Michelle" also got significant airplay on WIBG, but was nowhere of a hit as "Dawn of Correction". Group members John Medora and David White were more successful as songwriters: they co-wrote Danny and the Juniors' "At the Hop" (White was a member of that group), Lesley Gore's "You Don't Own Me" and Len Barry's "1-2-3", among others.
</li><li> <strong>Arlo Guthrie</strong>, the son of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie, had his one and only significant hit with a railroad blues song, "City of New Orleans" in the fall of 1972, peaking at No. 18 on the Hot 100, No. 4 on the adult contemporary chart and being a minor country hit as well. "... New Orleans", written by Steve Goodman, was successfully covered in 1984 (in a much more upbeat arrangement) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a>. That said, Guthrie — who like his father performed many socially conscious songs — was also well known for his 1969 composition and recording "Alice's Restaurant", an anti-Vietnam War protest song that also shines a light on the 1960s counterculture. As a song, "Alice's Restaurant" was a cultural phenomenon that was even turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlicesRestaurant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlicesRestaurant">a feature film</a>, but was completely unsuitable for single release because it was an 18 minute-long story song. Guthrie did try though, releasing the "Alice's Rock &amp; Roll Restaurant" single which kept the song's chorus, removed the whole story and added three new verses that were about the actual restaurant, but it only made it to #97 on the Hot 100, and was his only other chart entry aside from "New Orleans".
</li><li> <strong>The Rose Garden</strong> had a Top 20 hit in 1967 with "Next Plane to London" but were never heard from again. The songwriter, Kenny O'Dell, was also a one-hit wonder twice over; see the "Country" subpage.
</li><li> <strong>Nizlopi</strong> scored a #1 hit in the UK with their song "JCB" in 2005. Their second single made it to #91 and after that, they never reached the charts again.
</li><li> <strong>The Silkie</strong> took a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away" to #28 in the UK and #10 in the US in 1965. The cover had input from the Fab Four themselves: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> produced the single, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> played guitar, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> contributed percussion. However, the band's further success in America was hampered when they were unable to obtain visas and permits in time for a scheduled tour of the country, forcing them to cancel those dates as well as appearances on both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEdSullivanShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEdSullivanShow">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanBandstand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanBandstand">American Bandstand</a></em>. Although the Silkie continued to perform for another three decades, they never had another chart entry anywhere in the world.
</li><li> <strong>Newton Faulkner</strong> has enjoyed critical acclaim and had two chart-topping albums in the UK, but his only hit to date is the #7 "Dream Catch Me". He would later go on to have a #8 hit in Australia with "I Hate Mondays"; however, that song was written specifically for an Australian radio show and thus was never released in any other country.
</li><li> <strong>Moms Mabley</strong>, best known as a comedienne and novelty musician, recorded a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">completely serious</a> cover of Dion's "Abraham, Martin, and John" a year after the original. It was her only hit, and for many years it made the then-75-year-old Mabley the oldest artist to have a single on the Hot 100.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Funk </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <strong>Cameo</strong> had a massive crossover hit in 1986 with "Word Up!", which hit #6. While their direct follow-up "Candy" did manage to hit #21, it's virtually unknown to those outside their audience.
</li><li> <strong>Cookin' On 3 Burners</strong>, a small Australian funk group, had their only chart action when "This Girl" was remixed by Kungs (also a one-hit wonder outside of a few European countries) and became a massive worldwide hit in 2016.
</li><li> <strong>Eddy Grant</strong>: If you know any of his songs, it's likely "Electric Avenue", which was a #2 hit in the US and UK in 1982. His only other American Top 40 entry was the theme song to the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomancingTheStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomancingTheStone">Romancing the Stone</a></em> in 1984, which faded into obscurity afterward. However, he had more hits internationally.
<ul><li> Before he went solo, Grant was the guitarist for the 1960s band <strong>The Equals</strong>, who were one of the few mixed-race British rock bands of the era. The band had several hits in the UK, but just one in the US: "Baby Come Back", which made it to #32 in 1968. Another one of their songs, "Police on My Back", is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">better remembered</a> for the 1980 cover version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>E.U.</strong> were one of the leading bands in Washington D.C.'s go-go funk scene of the 1980s, but only had one national hit despite their regional following. Their song "Da Butt" reached #35 on the Hot 100 and topped the R&amp;B chart in 1988 after being featured in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeLee">Spike Lee</a>'s film <em>School Daze</em>. The band would have two more top ten hits on the R&amp;B chart but never made the Hot 100 again.
</li><li> Technically, <strong>The Ides of March</strong> are a one-hit wonder with their 1970 hit "Vehicle" (#2), but in Chicago, they had other hits on local radio ("You Wouldn't Listen", "Superman", "L.A.

</li><li> Kentucky-based electro-funk group <strong>Midnight Star</strong> had several hits on the R&amp;B charts, but their sole #1 "Operator", proved to be their only pop crossover at #18. Another tune, "Freak-A-Zoid", has also had some staying power, but it made it no further than #66 on the Hot 100. After the group disbanded, members and brothers Reginald and Vincent Calloway formed a duo of their own called <strong>Calloway</strong>. The group had a massive #2 pop hit with "I Wanna Be Rich", but their momentum dried up not long afterwards and they turned to production work.

<ul><li> <strong>The Dave Brubeck Quartet</strong> is one of the most influential and popular jazz groups of all time, but their only Top 40 entry was the classic "Take Five", a #25 hit in 1961. "Take Five" is often cited to be the best-selling jazz single of all time, and its parent <em>Time Out</em> album was the first jazz LP to sell more than one million copies, but they never reached the singles chart again for the rest of their long career.
</li><li> Bill Chase was a jazz musician who had a cult following but never tasted mainstream success, tragically dying in a 1974 plane crash at 39. His only hit, recorded with his band <strong>Chase</strong>, was 1971's "Get it On". The song went to #24 on the Hot 100 in 1971 and is best known as the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TRex">T Rex</a>'s contemporaneous hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">of the same name</a> was renamed "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" upon its release in the United States.
</li><li> <strong>Boots Randolph</strong>'s only Top 40 hit was "Yakety Sax" in 1963. The song was popularized through its use in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBennyHillShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBennyHillShow">The Benny Hill Show</a></em>, and by extension, has become a tune used to automatically make anything funny.
</li><li> <strong>King Pleasure</strong> (born Clarence Beeks), an early master of vocalese, is best known for "Moody's Mood for Love", a 1952 classic which added lyrics to James Moody's alto sax improvisation of "I'm in the Mood for Love" recorded in 1949.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatMetheny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatMetheny">Pat Metheny</a></strong> is an icon of the jazz fusion genre, has won 20 Grammys, and often rates highly on lists of the greatest guitarists of all time. He scored his only American Top 40 appearance in 1987, when "This Is Not America", a collaboration with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>, made it to #32.
</li><li> Country-pop band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RestlessHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RestlessHeart">Restless Heart</a> is no one-hit wonder, with multiple hits on the country, Hot 100, and AC charts. But their 1993 single "Tell Me What You Dream" was the only major chart entry for Canadian smooth-jazz saxophonist <strong>Warren Hill</strong>, who was credited for his solos and appeared in the song's music video. Being an instrumentalist, Hill was largely limited to his own genre after that.
</li><li> <strong>Norah Jones</strong> is a weird example in that she's only had Top 40 hit in her career — "Don't Know Why", which only peaked at #30. At the same time, the album that the song came from, <em>Come Away with Me</em>, went <em>Diamond</em> (as in <em>selling ten million copies</em>) in the United States alone. Her lack of chart success relative to her album sales is primarily because her music isn't really fit for pop or rock radio, yet has massive appeal to adult contemporary and adult alternative audiences. Jones has had four #1 hits on the Billboard Adult Alternative chart (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChartDisplacement">"Don't Know Why" was not one of them</a>), and not a single one crossed over to the Hot 100.
</li><li> <strong>Les and Larry Elgart</strong> had a successful run of big band albums in the 1950s and 1960s, both individually and as a duo, that featured their trademark "Elgart sound". Nowadays, they're only remembered as the originators of "Bandstand Boogie", the theme song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanBandstand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanBandstand">American Bandstand</a></em>.
</li><li> <strong>Spyro Gyra</strong> were one of the most popular jazz groups of the 1980s and were a major influence on the smooth jazz genre, but their only Top 40 hit was the instrumental "Morning Dance", which reached #24 in the US in 1979.
</li><li> <strong>Gordon Haskell</strong>, a former vocalist for progressive rock legends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson">King Crimson</a>, scored a #2 hit in the UK during Christmas 2002 with his jazz ballad "How Wonderful You Are". The song's success was the result of heavy airplay on BBC Radio 2, and it remains the most played song in the history of that station. Despite the success of the song, Haskell had no further hits.
</li><li> <strong>Bobby McFerrin</strong> had a #1 hit in late 1988 with "Don't Worry, Be Happy", the first <em>a cappella</em> song ever to reach the top of that chart. McFerrin had a long career as a jazz musician before and after, but he has never released any other singles. Since his only hit, he has remained popular in jazz circles and as an orchestral conductor.
</li><li> <strong>Cannonball Adderley</strong> reached #11 on the Hot 100 in 1966 with the instrumental tune "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy". The song was written by Adderley's pianist Joe Zawinul, who would later go on to much success as the co-leader of the jazz fusion band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeatherReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeatherReport">Weather Report</a>. As for Adderley, he never made the Hot 100 again, but he was a highly regarded saxophonist and best known for his work with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis">Miles Davis</a>; He shared saxophone duties with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnColtrane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnColtrane">John Coltrane</a> on Davis' legendary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KindOfBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KindOfBlue">Kind of Blue</a></em> album.

Despite her importance and popularity, she only had one Top 40 hit in the United States, when her cover of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/PorgyAndBess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/PorgyAndBess">I Loves You, Porgy</a>" reached #18 in 1959. Five more Simone singles reached the Hot 100, including her legendary recording "I Got No, I Got Life", but none of them got any higher than #76. Simone was more successful as a singles artist in the UK, where four of her songs reached the top ten.

<ul><li> Quite possibly the quintessential one-hit wonder is <strong>Los del Río</strong>, who you know as the duo who released the "Macarena" and absolutely nothing else. They were a well-known flamenco duo in their native Spain, and had been performing together since the early 1960s; the song was such a phenomenon that it made the two middle-aged singers incredibly wealthy within a few months. Although they never had a global hit again  not even charting in the Latin countries again  they've continued to record and perform to the present day. Additionally, it's not the original version that we all know and love. The well-known version is actually a remix by <strong>The Bayside Boys</strong>, probably because it added English lyrics. The original version of the song also charted on the Hot 100, peaking at #23. A third version of "Macarena", called "Macarena Christmas" also hit the Hot 100 and went top 5 in Australia. There was also a knockoff cover version by <strong>Los del Mar</strong> at the same time, which proved to be <em>their</em> only hit. Finally, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a>-themed parody called "Macarena (Country Version)" was the only hit for <strong>The GrooveGrass Boyz</strong> (whose membership included several popular bluegrass musicians and funk bassist Bootsy Collins).
</li><li> "Heaven" by <strong>Los Lonely Boys</strong>. They had two more minor chart entries on the AC and Adult top 40 charts, but "Heaven" will forever be their defining hit.
</li><li> <strong>Son By Four</strong> are a popular Puerto Rican salsa group, but their only hit in the English-speaking world was the "Purest Of Pain," a remake of their Spanish song "A Puro Dolor", which reached #26 on the Hot 100 in 2000.
</li><li> In 1999, German producer <strong>Lou Bega</strong> added lyrics to the mambo standard "Mambo No. 5" and created a smash: the song was a #1 hit around the world, including France, where it spent 20 weeks at the top (the only chart it didn't top was the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, but it still made #3 and was omnipresent in popular culture there). Bega was unable to follow up on his success. His next singles "I Got a Girl" and "Tricky, Tricky" were very minor hits in a few countries, and were nowhere as popular as "Mambo". His second album was a flop, and he was dropped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RCARecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RCARecords">RCA Records</a> shortly thereafter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EnriqueIglesias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EnriqueIglesias">Enrique Iglesias</a> is definitely not a one-hit wonder, but <strong>Descemer Bueno</strong> and <strong>Gente de Zona</strong>, the two featured acts on his 2014 hit "Bailando", are one-hit wonders. Both acts have been fairly popular in their native Cuba, but neither came close to the success of "Bailando" since. At least the latter later scored some hits on the Latin charts (especially 2015s La Gozadera, which features salsa superstar Marc Anthony and has also passed the billion view mark on YouTube like Bailando), but the former is a better example of the trope, as he even falls short of Gente de Zonas success; besides Bailando and his domestic success, Bueno is mostly just known for featuring on 2017s Súbeme La Radio, <em>another</em> Enrique Iglesias single.
</li><li> <strong>Kaoma</strong> are only known for their 1990 hit "Lambada" and nothing else.
</li><li> <strong>The Chakachas</strong> were a Belgian group of Latin studio musicians who were popular all throughout Europe, but only made a dent on the international charts with the 1971 instrumental "Jungle Fever".
</li><li> Basque singing group <strong>Mocedades</strong> were entered into the 1973 Eurovision song contest with "Eres Tu — Touch the Wind". Although they finished in second, the song became a massive worldwide hit. Naturally, all further success was limited to Spain.
</li><li> In his native Spain, <strong>Miguel Ríos</strong> is one of the most revered musicians of all time. Internationally, he's only really known for his remake of "Ode To Joy", titled "A Song of Joy", which hit #14 on the Hot 100.
</li><li> Argentinean fusion rock group <strong>La Mosca Tsé-Tsé</strong> exists since 1995, but the only song of theirs that was a success outside their country borders was "<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Zj4zbiMEK9A">Para no verte mas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", which gained good airplay in 2000.

Their only other top 40 was a feature on "Got To Get It", a minor Sisqo hit released around the same time.
</li><li> Brazillian guitar duo <strong>Los Indios Tabajaras</strong> only had one hit in America — a version of "Maria Elena".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shakira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shakira">Shakira</a> is not a one-hit wonder, but some of her collaborators have been:
<ul><li> "La Tortura" was the sole American hit for Latin singer <strong>Alejandro Sanz</strong>, although he's a big deal on the genre charts and south of the border.
</li><li> <strong>Freshlyground</strong> are an iconic folk band down in South Africa, but otherwise are only known for singing backup on "Waka Waka".
</li><li> "Loca" provides a double example. The Spanish version is the only hit of <strong>El Cata</strong>, a Dominican singer, who while popular in his homeland, never quite made it big elsewhere. He had another later hit collaboration with Shakira with "Rabiosa", but it didn't chart on the pop side. Meanwhile, the English version was the only American hit of <strong>Dizzee Rascal</strong>, a British rapper who is certainly <em>not</em> a one-hit wonder in his homeland. Strangely enough, the song was never released in the UK.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>The Blackout All-Stars</strong>, a one-off supergroup consisting of several veteran Latin musicians, scored a Top 30 hit on the Hot 100 in 1996 with their cover of Pete Rodriguez' "I Like It Like That". The cover had been recorded two years prior and it had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization">a spike in interest</a> due to its use in a Burger King ad. The recording was also the first and only time that legendary Latin jazz drummer <strong>Tito Puente</strong> ever ventured into the US Top 40.
</li><li> <strong>Gerardo</strong> had a hit in 1991 with the Latin-rap song "Rico Suave". While "We Want the Funk" was also a top 20 hit, it was quickly forgotten.

The band is better known now for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand">rotating lineup of members</a> who were removed from the band when they either turned 16 or grew too tall, and for being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout">former group</a> of hitmaker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickyMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickyMartin">Ricky Martin</a>.
</li><li> Spanish girl group <strong>Las Ketchup</strong> is best known for its novelty pop song "The Ketchup Song (Aserejé)" was a huge international hit, reaching #1 in 25 countries (a major exception being United States, where it only reached #54). Subsequent singles from the group didn't reach the same level of success as they had with "Aserejé" though.

</li><li> Despite already having time within the genre and recording with well-known acts, Colombian reggaeton artist <strong>Wolfine</strong> is best known for his 2017 hit Bella, but unfortunately he pales in comparison to other domestic acts such as J Balvin and Maluma; the latter of whom was featured on the subsequent remix to Bella, which at least wasnt much of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EclipsedByTheRemix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EclipsedByTheRemix">Eclipsed by the Remix</a>.

<ul><li> During his lifetime, <strong>Scott Joplin</strong>'s one and only hit was his 1899 breakthrough "Maple Leaf Rag", though he continued to write and publish rags until his death in 1917, always marketed as being "from the composer of the Maple Leaf Rag". (He also attempted to branch out into more "serious" music by writing a couple of operas, but these were even bigger failures than his follow-up rags.) In retrospect, thanks to his music being featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting">The Sting</a></em> and the subsequent ragtime revival of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, a much larger library of his work has become remembered by modern audiences, including one of his lesser works, "The Entertainer", even supplanting the "Maple Leaf Rag" in the popular consciousness. (His operas remain niche works, but have been staged and are appreciated for their ambition at a time when Joplin's race was an impediment to being taken seriously as a "legitimate" artist.)
</li><li> In 1974, composer <strong>Marvin Hamlisch</strong> took a cover of Joplin's "The Entertainer" - from his score for the aforementioned <em>The Sting</em> - to #3 on the Hot 100. Although Hamlisch is an American music icon, being the rare example of a PEGOT (winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony in addition to his 1975 Pulitzer Prize), he never again made the pop charts.

<ul><li> <strong>Big Mountain</strong> are known entirely for their cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterFrampton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterFrampton">Peter Frampton</a>'s "Baby, I Love Your Way", which was an international smash in 1994.
</li><li> <strong>Ini Kamoze</strong> topped the <em>Billboard</em> charts in 1994 with "Here Comes the Hotstepper". His follow-up single "Listen Me Tic" made it to just #88 and he never charted again after that.
</li><li> <strong>Snow</strong> topped the <em>Billboard</em> charts for a whopping seven weeks in 1993 with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae">Reggae</a> meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop">Hip-Hop</a> song "Informer", and became the best-selling reggae song of all time despite the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndecipherableLyrics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndecipherableLyrics">nobody could understand what he was saying</a>. While his follow-up "Girl I've Been Hurt" charted in the Top 20 (peaking at #19), it's widely considered to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">Creator Killer</a>. All songs since then have failed to chart at all. The fact that Snow was in jail at the time it was released, and couldn't actually leave his native Canada to tour the world at the height of his popularity, certainly didn't help. Also featured in the song was a producer and old-school rapper <strong>MC Shan</strong>, who contributed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWildRapperAppears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWildRapperAppears">guest rap verse</a> that. 2019 would later see Snow featured on Daddy Yankee's "Con Calma", itself interpolating "Informer". The song would become a massive hit in many countries and a moderate hit in the U.S., but Snow being a featured artist, and the fact it was directly based on the song that made him famous in the first place, doesn't disqualify him from one-hit wonder status.
</li><li> <strong>Nina Sky</strong>, a female duo consisting of identical twins from New York, had a #4 hit in 2004 with "Move Ya Body". That was also their only song to chart on the <em>Hot 100</em>, not counting a guest's appearance on N.O.R.E.'s #12 "Oye Mi Canto", which wasn't <em>their</em> hit and is mostly forgotten today; thus it doesn't disqualify their status as a one-hit wonder. By extension, <strong>Jabba</strong> the featured artist on the song is also a one-hit wonder.
</li><li> <strong>MAGIC!</strong>, a Canadian reggae group fronted by well-known songwriter Nasri Atweh hit #1 for six weeks in 2014 with "Rude", but a massive backlash against the song and the band took place almost immediately afterward. Thus, MAGIC! never even hit the Bubbling Under charts with any of their other songs. Only thirteen other artists can claim such a dubious honor. And given the fact that "Rude" was so left-field a hit, they're unlikely to ever chart again (although their followups managed modest success in their native Canada).
</li><li> <strong>OMI</strong> had a massive chart-topping hit in the summer of 2015 with a remix of his 2012 song "Cheerleader", which topped numerous charts including the United States. However, it was seen as too much of a left-field novelty for consistent success and OMI had no public image whatsoever. His follow-up "Hula Hoop" flat-out bombed in most countries (Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Australia, Austria and Belgium being the exceptions; in the U.S. it missed the entire Hot 100)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7c0zq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7c0zq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7c0zq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though the song has fared somewhat better on music streaming platforms, with a respectable 210 million Spotify streams, but still pales to Cheerleaders <em>one billion</em>...</span>, and his album <em>Me 4 U</em> only debuted at #51, making it one of the lowest-selling albums to ever house a #1 hit (and it placed behind, of all people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Stryper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Stryper">Stryper</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">a Christian hair-metal band whose only Top 40 hit came in 1987</a>); that's not even taking into account that the peak was inflated by streams and single sales (most of which came from, unsurprisingly, "Cheerleader" itself), when in actuality it completely failed to hit the top 100. His third single, "Drop in the Ocean" (featuring fellow one-hit wonder AronChupa) bombed everywhere (even harder than "Hula Hoop"). In fact, <strong>Felix Jaehn</strong>, the DJ behind the remix, has fared far better than OMI, having scored a massive European hit of his own with his cover of Rufus and Chaka Khan's "Ain't Nobody (Loves Me Better)", and has quickly climbed up the electronic music scene. That being said, Jaehn remains a one-hit wonder in the U.S.
</li><li> <strong>Kevin Lyttle</strong> managed a #4 hit in 2004 with "Turn Me On". It was his only ever entry on the Hot 100.
</li><li> While <strong>R. City</strong> are successful songwriters, the Virgin Islander sibling duo had their first bonafide hit as musicians with 2015's "Locked Away" (featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamLevine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamLevine">Adam Levine</a>), which went Top 10. However, since Adam Levine is the reason it charted, it's mostly associated with him and/or misattributed to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Maroon5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Maroon5">band</a>. Given how "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">well</a>" this situation worked out for Mark Ronson (see the pop subpage) and being yet another act in the Nico &amp; Vinz/MAGIC!/OMI mold, combined with the fact that R. City doesn't have any following in the mainstream and that their album <em>What Dreams Are Made Of</em> was released to little fanfare, it was hardly surprising that their next single "Make Up" made no noise on the charts, and thus they have next-to-no chance of ever scoring a successful follow-up.
</li><li> Although Michael Franti of <strong>Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead</strong> had a few minor hits in the U.K. in the 90s, most people in North America probably can't name anything he's done besides his 2009 #18 hit "Say Hey (I Love You)".
</li><li> UK group <strong>Hotshots</strong> had their only hit in 1973 with a ska version of "Snoopy vs. The Red Baron". The original version by <strong>The Royal Guardsmen</strong> had also been <em>their</em> only big hit a few years earlier. The sequel song "Return of the Red Baron" scraped the top 40 a few months later.
<ul><li> While in the US, the Guardsmen are remembered pretty much only for "Snoopy vs. The Red Baron," both "Return of the Red Baron" and the non-Snoopy related "Baby Let's Wait" (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> version of a song originally recorded by The Rascals) were top 40 hits there. The song "Snoopy's Christmas," however, is also fondly remembered (had Billboard not restricted Christmas songs to a separate chart in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, "Snoopy's Christmas" probably would've given them a second Top 10 hit).
</li></ul></li><li> Despite being one of the most influential and important artists in Jamaican music, <strong>Desmond Dekker</strong> only managed a single Top 40 hit in the US, with his classic 1968 single "Israelites". The song is considered to be one of the earliest hits in the then-nascent reggae genre. Dekker had several other hits in the UK.
</li><li> <strong>Musical Youth</strong> had an international smash in 1982 with "Pass the Dutchie". The song topped the charts in several countries around the world and made the Top 10 in the United States. While the band racked up several other hit singles in their native United Kingdom and neighboring Ireland, "Dutchie" was their only hit in the United States or Canada.
</li><li> <strong>Ziggy Marley and The Melody Makers</strong> scored their only major international pop hit in 1988 when "Tomorrow People" made it to #39 in the US and #22 in the UK. At the same time, Ziggy and his siblings and bandmates Stephen, Sharon, and Cedella became the first members of the Marley family to ever have a Top 40 single in the US; Their legendary father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob</a> got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder">no further than #51</a>, and their brother Damian would only manage to reach #55 when his own career took off in the mid-2000s. Despite having no further pop success, both Ziggy and Stephen have remained superstars in the reggae world.
</li><li> <strong>Wayne Wonder</strong> has been recording since the late 1980s, but his first hit didn't come until 2003, when "No Letting Go" charted all around the world, including #11 in the US and #3 in the UK. His follow-up "Bounce Along" was only a hit in the UK and he hasn't made any chart since.
</li><li> Teenage Jamaican duo <strong>Althea &amp; Donna</strong> went all the way to #1 in the UK in 1978 with their single "Uptown Top Ranking", following airplay on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnPeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnPeel">John Peel</a>'s radio show. The duo's next two singles did not chart, and neither did their only album.
</li><li> Shaggy is not a one-hit wonder by himself, but both of his #1 hits feature one-hit wonders:
<ul><li> "It Wasn't Me" features Jamaican-English singer <strong>Ricardo "RikRok" Ducent</strong>, which was also a #1 hit in the UK and the year's top-selling single there. Nothing else he put out made a dent.
</li><li> "Angel", which sampled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveMillerBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveMillerBand">Steve Miller Band</a>'s "The Joker" and Juice Newton's "Angel of the Morning", featured Barbadian singer <strong>Rayvon</strong>. Rayvon and Shaggy also collaborated on a cover of Mungo Jerry's "In the Summertime" six years prior, but it was only issued as a B-side.
</li></ul></li><li> Jamaican dancehall artist <strong>Charly Black</strong> is hardly known for anything other than his 2016 hit Gyal You A Party Animal. It didnt help that it was followed by a remix featuring Daddy Yankee, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EclipsedByTheRemix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EclipsedByTheRemix">surpassing the original in streams on many platforms such as Spotify</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Matisyahu</strong> scored a #28 Hot 100 hit in 2006 with "King Without a Crown", a rare instance of a reggae song crossing over to pop from alt-rock radio. The song's success helped make Matisyahu one of the most talked-about new artists of that year, in part because he was a devout follower of Hadisic Judaism performing hip-hop and rock-influenced reggae, and that unique mix of styles and influences helped him stand out. While he had a few more alternative hits after "King Without a Crown", he never made the pop Top 40 again.

<ul><li> In 1974, Canadian broadcaster <strong>Gordon Sinclair</strong> penned a commentary piece called "The Americans", which was read on-air on the Windsor, Ontario station CKLW by fellow broadcaster <strong>Byron MacGregor</strong>. Due to the positive reception of the commentary, MacGregor's version was issued as a single, accompanied by an instrumental recording of "America the Beautiful". It reached #4 and he never saw the charts again. A recording by Sinclair was also issued, this one featuring "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" instead; it was also a minor hit, reaching #24, but he never saw the charts again either.
</li><li> <strong>Wink Martindale</strong> had a big hit in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> with his take on T. Texas Tyler's spoken-word standard "The Deck of Cards", about a soldier who uses ordinary playing cards as a means of religious symbolism. Martindale never had another chart hit, but he later made his living as a TV host, most notably for the game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough">Tic-Tac-Dough</a></em>.
</li><li> In 1971, disk jockey <strong>Tom Clay</strong> recorded "What the World Needs Now Is Love/Abraham, Martin, and John", which combined clips of the two hits (albeit sung by studio vocalists) with his narration and interview clips of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, and other important '60s icons. The song got to #8, but he never charted again.
</li><li> Also from 1971, <strong>Les Crane</strong> released a narration of the spiritual poem "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Desiderata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Desiderata">Desiderata</a>" with orchestral accompaniment. The poem, which was thought to be an ancient text, was actually written by a little known Indiana writer named Max Ehrmann, and after a lawsuit, his family got royalties from the song. Crane's accompanying album, featuring recitations of both existing and original poetry, won him the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. Crane was far more popular as a radio and television broadcaster but never recorded again.
</li><li> During the heat of the 1972 Presidential Election, a novelty group called <strong>The Delegates</strong> was formed to create the record "Convention '72." It consisted of a fictional convention between the many Presidential candidates of the year, depicted via snippets of popular songs of the time in the "break-in" style popularized by Dickie Goodman.
</li><li> Australian film director <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BazLuhrmann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BazLuhrmann">Baz Luhrmann</a></strong> is credited as the artist of the 1998 hit "Everbody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)", but it's an (understandable) misconception that he is the performer on the track. The actual narrator on the track is voice actor Lee Perry, who reads Mary Schmich's "Wear Sunscreen" essay (aka "Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young"). Luhrmann was merely the producer of the song and the person who came up with the idea of setting the essay to music. The single was a massive international hit, but Luhrmann went back to directing immediately afterward.
</li><li> In 1967, then-Senate Majority Leader <strong>Everett Dirksen</strong> scored a Top 40 hit with "Gallant Men" a recitation of a patriotic poem he had written backed by music. He was the first sitting United States Senator to score a pop hit. Although Dirksen recorded several spoken word albums, "Gallant Men" was his only chart entry before his death in 1969.
<ul><li> Around the same time, comedian Bill Minkin created an impersonation of him as <strong>Senator Everett McKinley</strong> alongside a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RobertFKennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> parody called <strong>Senator Bobby</strong> and recorded a single featuring two covers of the Troggs' "Wild Thing", with the Kennedy impression on one side and the Dirksen impression on the other. With the Bobby version getting lead billing, "Wild Thing" also went top 40.
</li></ul></li><li> Veteran radio broadcaster <strong>Victor Lundberg</strong> had a Top 10 hit in 1967 with "An Open Letter to My Teenage Son", a patriotic, and often histrionic, pro-Vietnam draft monologue that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">contrasted sharply in tone</a> with the rest of the Top 40 in the week that it peaked on the Billboard Hot 100. No less than <em>eight</em> response records were made, including one by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickClark">Dick Clark</a>. Lundberg never returned to the charts after the single's run,
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyGriffith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyGriffith">Andy Griffith</a></strong> was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow">incredibly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Matlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Matlock">famous</a> actor, but his only chart hit was his 1953 monologue "What It Was, Was Football".
</li><li> <strong>John Cooper Clarke</strong> is one of the most famous performance poets in the UK, known for his punk rock delivery style and strong affiliation with the Manchester post-punk scene. Despite his fame, he only managed one Top 40 single in the country, "Gimmix! (Play Loud)", a #39 entry in 1979.
</li><li> <strong>2NU</strong>, so named for the fact that they were "too new" to even <em>have</em> a name when their one hit was getting airplay, only charted once in 1991 with "This Is Ponderous," a bizarre hybrid of dance pop, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sampling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sampling">sampling</a> and deadpan, free-verse spoken word lyrics about a guy having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealDreamsAreWeirder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealDreamsAreWeirder">a weird dream</a>. It peeked at #44 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was briefly a staple of <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento">Dr. Demento</a> Show</em>, but neither their second single, "Spaz Attack," or their full-length LP, <em>Ponderous</em>, charted.
</li><li> Writer and performance artist <strong>Meryn Cadell</strong> scored a Top 40 hit in his native Canada and got to #24 on the Billboard alternative chart with "The Sweater" in 1992. Cadell released a few more albums during the '90s, but had retired from the music business by the end of the decade, and he is now a creative writing professor.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TellySavalas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TellySavalas">Telly Savalas</a></strong> was a television and film icon best known for playing the title role on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kojak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kojak">Kojak</a></em>, but he also had a career as a spoken word artist on the side. In 1975, he made it all the way to #1 in the UK with a cover of Bread's "If". A followup cover of The Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" failed to make the Top 40, peaking at #45, and that was hit last UK chart entry. In 1981, Savalas had a European hit with a cover of Don Williams' country hit "Some Broken Hearts Never Mend", which topped the charts in Switzerland and made the top 5 in the Netherlands and Austria, and was his only hit in those countries. Of course, Savalas had a long career as a television and film legend before and after his hits.

<ul><li> Boulder, Colorado-based group <strong>The Astronauts</strong> had only one charted hit with "Baja", which reached #94 for one week in July 1963. None of their other singles charted and only the first of their nine albums charted (<em>Surfin' with the Astronauts</em>, which featured "Baja", at #61).
</li><li> "Pipeline" by <strong>The Chantays</strong>. This surf-rock classic won them the #4 spot on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 and an appearance on <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LawrenceWelk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LawrenceWelk">Lawrence Welk</a> Show</em> (of all shows!), but none of their follow-ups charted.
</li><li> <strong>The Frogmen</strong> had their only hit with "Underwater", a proto-surf instrumental which reached #44 in 1961. It was the biggest hit Candix Records ever had; the release that label is better known for these days, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a>' debut "Surfin'", only reached #75 in early 1962, and it and "Underwater" were the only nationally charting hits of the short-lived label.
</li><li> <strong>The Rivieras</strong> are known almost solely for the widely covered "California Sun", which was a cover of Joe Jones (see the R&amp;B page).
</li><li> <strong>The Rumblers</strong> had one minor hit in 1963 with "Boss", which peaked at #87 in February 1963. All of their other releases failed to chart.
</li><li> <strong>The Rip Chords</strong> are pretty much known only for "Hey Little Cobra", a #4 hit in February 1964 which featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">Bruce Johnston</a> and Terry Melcher as uncredited vocalists. A couple of non-surf singles which didn't feature Johnston and Melcher had previously charted, but most of the attention the group gets nowadays outside of "Cobra" is for their other surf and hot-rod songs featuring the duo, which also recorded as "Bruce and Terry".
</li><li> "Wipe Out" by <strong>The Surfaris</strong>, which managed to chart <em>thrice</em> on the <em>Billboard</em>: #2 in August 1963, #16 in July 1966 and #110 in August 1970. The follow-up, "Point Panic", did chart at #49, but that one is largely forgotten outside the surf rock fanbase.
</li><li> <strong>The Trashmen</strong>, a surf rock band from Minneapolis, had two top 40 hits, the #4 "Surfin' Bird" and the #30 "Bird Dance Beat", but today are remembered only for the former, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization">especially due to its</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">constant usage</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>.

<ul><li> "Zoot Suit Riot" by <strong>The Cherry Poppin' Daddies</strong> released in 1998. It's their best-known song, having peaked at #32 on the U.S. Billboard Top 40 Mainstream, and hit the top 20 of the Modern Rock and Adult Top 40 charts. It just barely missed the top 40 of the Hot 100, however.
<ul><li> This song is an interesting example because first and foremost, the Cherry Poppin' Daddies were a <em>ska</em> band. They did occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette">wander into swing and jazz</a> on their albums here and there, but "Zoot Suit Riot" is probably among their most swing influenced songs. It originally appeared as a new song on <em>Zoot Suit Riot</em>, a compilation of all the swing-oriented songs that had appeared on their other albums. When the song became a hit, so did the album, and now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">they're identified as apart of the Swing Revival fad forevermore</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <strong>Squirrel Nut Zippers</strong> were a similar case. Their musical style was more diverse than just "swing revival", but their one hit, the top 20 rock hit "Hell," ended up associating them with the genre.

<ul><li> After having struggled in the Israeli pop music scene for nearly a decade, rocker <strong>Haim Zinovich</strong> felt that nobody would ever take him seriously, and effectively disappeared by the end of the '90s. In 2000, an Israeli talk show announced that they have booked a singer with a very unusual backstory: he was a man who lost the use of his legs and nearly burnt to death when his house caught on fire. Dubbing himself <strong>HaSaruf</strong>, or the Burnt Man, his debut single "Hevel HaChen, Sheker HaYofi" was an instant hit on Israeli radio, and Israelis rushed out to buy his mysterious debut album. After his big television appearance, HaSaruf unmasked himself to reveal that he was Zinovich in disguise all along. The ploy worked big time, as his album sold over 400,000 copies, becoming one of the best selling in the country's history, and "Hevel HaChen" was named the fifth-biggest hit of 2000. Unfortunately, his popularity waned considerably afterwards as the novelty had worn off; although he had a few more minor hits and released one more album under the HaSaruf name, they failed to live up to the success of his debut, and the project was shelved not long after. Zinovich and his songwriter Tomer Biran then started to make dance-funk music together under the name "Zino &amp; Tommy"; while their music made appearances on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em> and in several hit movies like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Click" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Click">Click</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RV">RV</a></em>, they never really sought getting hit singles in Israel or anywhere else.
</li><li> Legendary South African singer <strong>Miriam Makeba</strong>'s only American hit was her signature smash "Pata Pata", which reached #12 in 1967, ten years after she first recorded it. The song became one of the most famous "world music" songs of all time and ultimately became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> for African pop music as a whole.
</li><li> Israeli pop singer <strong>Ofra Haza</strong> had a surprise worldwide hit in 1988 with her dreamy update of the 17th century Hebrew poem "Im Nin'alu". In addition to being a smash all across Europe (including reaching number one in four countries), it was also a Top 20 hit on the Billboard Modern Rock charts in the United States. It was also Haza's only hit outside of Israel.
</li><li> Canadian Celtic singer <strong>Loreena McKennitt</strong> scored a Top 20 hit on both the Hot 100 and the alternative chart in 1997 with a remixed version of her song "The Mummers' Dance". Although this was the only time one of her singles made the American charts, she's continued to have a strong cult following, and she has three Gold-certified albums.
</li><li> Hawaiian ukuleleist <strong>Israel Kamakawiwoʻole</strong> recorded his medley of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" and "What a Wonderful World" in 1990, but it did not become a hit until after his death in 1997. His unique interpretation of the songs picked up a considerable following over the years, and the medley found its way into several film soundtracks. It slowly became a hit around the world, making it to #22 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart in 2004 and #1 in France in 2010. It's been Kamakawiwoʻole's only charting single, and despite never making the Hot 100, it's been ceritified quadruple platinum for <em>four million sales</em> in the United States alone.
</li><li> The Nigerian highlife group <strong>Prince Nico Mbarga &amp; Rocafil Jazz</strong> only had one major hit, 1976's "Sweet Mother", but it was a big one: The 10 minute-long single is reputed to have sold <em>13 million copies</em> and is one of the best-selling recordings in world history, despite being largely unknown outside of West Africa.
</li><li> British DJ <strong>Panjabi MC</strong> and Indian singer <strong>Labh Janjua</strong> scored an international hit in 2003 with a remix of their 1999 electro-bhangra single "Mundian To Bach Ke" that included a newly recorded guest verse from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ">Jay-Z</a>. The song went to #33 in the US, #5 in the UK, and #1 in Italy, Belgium and Greece. Panjabi MC's follow-up single "Jogi" was a hit in a couple of other countries, but not in the US or UK. Janjua, who was uncredited on the remix despite being the vocalist, had no further international hits before his death in 2015.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AfroCeltSoundSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AfroCeltSoundSystem">Afro Celt Sound System</a></strong>, an eclectic group formed as a collaboration between Irish and West African musicians, scored a massive adult-alternative hit in 2001 with their song "When You're Falling". It spent six weeks atop Billboard's Triple-A chart that summer, helped in part because it featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> (who also owned their record label Real World Records) on lead vocals. The band never had another Billboard hit afterwards.
</li><li> Gabriel was also responsible for another world music one-hit wonder. <strong>Big Blue Ball</strong> was a supergroup he had formed in the 1990s, but whose album was stuck in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> for 18 years. It was finally released in 2008, and shortly after that, its lead single "Burn You Up, Burn You Down" - which featured Gabriel alongside Billy Cobham of Mahavishnu Orchestra, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicImageLtd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicImageLtd">Jah Wobble</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PrincesAssociates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PrincesAssociates">Wendy Melvoin</a> - made it to #18 on the adult alternative chart. The group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">never recorded again</a> after the release of their album, and none of its other singles made any other music charts.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyClegg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyClegg">Johnny Clegg</a></strong> was an influential and highly significant musician and activist in South Africa, known for leading one of the few multi-racial musical groups during the Apartheid era. However, despite his international importance, Clegg only had one American hit single; "Cruel, Crazy, Beautiful World", recorded with his band <strong>Savuka</strong>, reached #27 on the modern rock chart in 1990.
</li><li> Cameroonian jazz-funk saxophonist <strong>Manu Dibango</strong> scored a #32 Hot 100 hit in 1972 with his single "Soul Makossa". The song was later interpolated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s hit "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'". Dibango never had another hit single, but he continued to be a star in the afrobeat and jazz scenes until his death from the COVID-19 virus in 2020.
</li><li> Guinean singer <strong>Mory Kanté</strong> had an international hit in 1987 with "Yé ké yé ké", which reached the top 40 in the UK, Ireland, Germany, and France, and topped the charts in Israel, Belgium, Finland, and Spain. The song remains one of the best-selling singles by an African artist outside of Africa, but Kanté had no further European success apart from a remix of "Yé ké yé ké" by the German techno group Hardfloor that was a hit in a few of those same countries in 1994.

Based on her statements in interviews and convention panels, this is by choice, and she has no desire to act after <em>Greys</em> finishes.

Only three of the main actors (one of them being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenStiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenStiller">Ben Stiller</a>'s wife Christine Taylor) went on to have acting careers beyond the ranch.
<ul><li> This is in fact true of most Nick shows of the 1990s—with rare exceptions (namely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaJoanHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaJoanHart">Melissa Joan Hart</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenanThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenanThompson">Kenan Thompson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiloKiley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiloKiley">Blake Sennett</a>) the vast majority of the channel's child actors dropped off the map after serving their time on Nick.

However, the one-season actors (Ed Alonzo and Leanna Freel), the newcomers from <em>The College Years</em> and the majority of the actors from the <em>The New Class</em> were, for the most part, never heard from again. Even the ones who still acted afterwards didn't really do anything memorable (with the exceptions of Bianca Lawson (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>) and Sarah Lancaster (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em>)). Isaac Lidskey, who played Screech-clone Weasel, didn't mind too much considering he graduated from Harvard law school at 19 and eventually worked with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor at 28 despite becoming legally blind.
</li><li> Carrie Henn, who played Newt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em>, has never had another acting role. According to <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>'s 2011 Reunion Issue, Henn was bullied by her schoolmates about her role and has since become a schoolteacher.
</li><li> Jeremy Black, who played the infant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouClonedHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouClonedHitler">Hitler clones</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoysFromBrazil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoysFromBrazil">The Boys from Brazil</a></em>, has his only film credit with that movie - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDB">IMDB</a> lists a TV appearance, but he really focused on theater.
</li><li> Another infant, 3 years old at the time, Oliwia Dąbrowska, was the girl in red in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchindlersList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchindlersList">Schindler's List</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> asked Dąbrowska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven and was <em>horrified</em>. Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played, although she never has acted again.
</li><li> Mary Badham's debut role as Scout Finch in the film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ToKillAMockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ToKillAMockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></em>, for which she was nominated for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Oscar</a>. She appeared in a few other roles before retiring from acting at 14. She went on to become an art restorer and a college testing coordinator, though she had a small role in an independent film in 2005.

He played only one other small role in a TV film before quitting acting and becoming a teacher.
<ul><li> Also, the actresses who played the naked girl in the bathtub and the old hag she turns into never did anything else before or after.
</li></ul></li><li> Lots of horror and slasher roles:
<ul><li> Nancy Kye's only significant role is Annie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978">Halloween</a></em>. She did do other on-camera work (including other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter">John Carpenter</a> films), but nothing as popular.

</li></ul></li><li> Adrienne King, who played the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">Final Girl</a> in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th1980" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th1980">Friday the 13th</a></em> has no other major film credits, although this was mostly because she quit acting the following year after being targeted by a stalker, and didn't come out of retirement until 2010.
</li><li> Marilyn Burns, who played the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">Final Girl</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainSawMassacre1974" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainSawMassacre1974">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></em> had no other major film roles outside that franchise before her death in 2014.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeatherLangenkamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HeatherLangenkamp">Heather Langenkamp</a> is only known for playing Nancy in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet1984">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet3DreamWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet3DreamWarriors">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WesCravensNewNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WesCravensNewNightmare">sequels</a>. She had some other small roles, but nothing as notable. Playing ice skater Nancy Kerrigan in a TV movie <em>Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story</em> is her second most famous role.
<ul><li> Patricia Arquette (Kristen Parker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet3DreamWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet3DreamWarriors">A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</a></em>) would later become an Oscar-winning actress and is not a one-hit wonder. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TuesdayKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TuesdayKnight">Tuesday Knight</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">replaced her as Kristen in</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet4TheDreamMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet4TheDreamMaster">A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master</a></em> has no other major acting credits.

Outside of a small role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em> as Cougar, his acting career never took off, mainly due to starring in films that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">BoxOfficeBombs</a> and/or critical failures, such as <em>Dangerously Close</em>, which he unfortunately co-wrote. It's why he became a director.
</li></ul></li><li> Nia Vardalos came out of nowhere in 2002 with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBigFatGreekWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBigFatGreekWedding">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a></em>, which she wrote and starred in, and which subsequently became the highest-grossing romantic comedy of all-time. She fell as fast as she rose with a number of flops (the <em>My Big Fat Greek Life</em> television show, <em>Connie and Carla</em>, <em>My Life in Ruins</em>, <em>Larry Crowne</em>). In 2016, she returned with <em>My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2</em>, which did decently at the box office, but was thrashed by critics and quickly forgotten, and as a result didn't do very much to re-establish Vardalos as either an actress or writer.
</li><li> All the child actors from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</a></em>.

Philip Wiegratz (Augustus) has no other credits outside some small films in his native Germany. Julia Winter (Veruca) has no other credits at all outside of the video game adaptation of the movie.

</li><li> Several non-professional actors have been cast in a film that remains either their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">only role</a>, or their only role of note:
<ul><li> Harold Russell's film debut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBestYearsOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBestYearsOfOurLives">The Best Years of Our Lives</a></em> netted him <em>two</em> Oscars, the only time two Oscars have ever been awarded for the same performance.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8t1ax');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8t1ax" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8t1ax');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Academy's Board of Governors wanted to recognize Russell's performance in the film but thought that as a non-professional in his first role he would never win a competitive award. So, they gave him an honorary Oscar for "bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans." Then he won Best Supporting Actor.</span> It would be 34 years before he had another film credit; his two remaining credits were very minor roles in since-forgotten movies.
</li><li> Dr. Haing S. Ngor, a Cambodian gynecologist, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his only major film role, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKillingFields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKillingFields">The Killing Fields</a></em>. Along with Harold Russell, he is one of only two non-professional actors to win an Academy Award.
</li><li> Wrestler Stanislaus Zbyszko was cast in the 1950 noir <em>Night and the City</em> because the director, Jules Dassin, wanted to coach a wrestler to act rather than teach an actor to wrestle. He had seen Zbyszko when he was young and wanted someone like him, without knowing Zbyszko was still alive. It turned out Zbyszko even lamented the transformation of wrestling into showmanship the same way his character in the movie, Gregorius, did.
<ul><li> For similar reasons, light-heavyweight boxing champion Antonio Tarver was cast as Mason "The Line" Dixon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa">Rocky Balboa</a></em>, which remains his only professional acting role to date - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> thought it would be easier to teach a boxer to act rather than train an actor to box convincingly. He might have come to this conclusion after casting boxer Tommy Morrison in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV">Rocky V</a></em>.
</li><li> In the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Miracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Miracle">Miracle</a></em>, about the 1980 gold-medal winning US Olympic hockey team, many of the actors who portrayed members of the team were real-life hockey players; Billy Schneider played his father, Buzz Schneider, for instance. (For that matter, coach Herb Brooks is played by proven actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell">Kurt Russell</a>, who was briefly a real-life pro baseball player before becoming a full-time actor.)
</li></ul></li><li> Michael Wallis, a historian and journalist who has written 17 books on the Western United States, only has one acting role: the voice of the Sheriff of Radiator Springs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars">Cars</a></em>, its sequel and other spinoff media.

Around the same time she also got pregnant at the age of just 16; something not really <em>that</em> big of a deal in her native New Zealand, but in the U.S. it produced such a backlash from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> that it ensured no studio would go near her for any mainstream family-friendly projects. She tried to make a comeback with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>, but her performance was considered underwhelming, especially by the show's standards, and is today one of the very few <em>Game of Thrones</em> actors' whose part on the show has not become their most famous role.

That being said, today she is commonly considered a one-hit wonder for her role in the latter, as it's the only movie people remember her by, while her silent film work is long forgotten.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyPerkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyPerkins">Anthony Perkins</a> played Norman Bates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Psycho</a></em>. He became so strongly associated with the Bates character that his career got destroyed due to chronic typecasting.
</li><li> Mira Sorvino is known for her Oscar-winning role in <em>Mighty Aphrodite</em> and not much else, except maybe <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomyAndMichelesHighSchoolReunion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomyAndMichelesHighSchoolReunion">Romy and Michele's High School Reunion</a></em>.

For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> version, you had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera">Christina Aguilera</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinTimberlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinTimberlake">Justin Timberlake</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanGosling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanGosling">Ryan Gosling</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeriRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeriRussell">Keri Russell</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSync" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSync">J.C.

The latter five are almost never brought up when talking about the show's famous alumni, and it's common for Gosling to be ignored in favor of the show's musical breakouts.
</li><li> Nearly all of the child actors on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney &amp; Friends</a></em> disappeared from the spotlight afterwards, as they were for the most part natives of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DFWMetroplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DFWMetroplex">DFW Metroplex</a>, which is hardly a breeding ground for major entertainment stars.

In the public consciousness, it's only widely known that the former two are ex-<em>Barney</em> stars and the fact that they met on the show and became best friends afterwards. The latter two, although popular, were never nearly as big a star as Gomez or Lovato and few people remember they were on the show, as their parts were merely minor background roles whereas Gomez and Lovato were part of the main kids cast. Of the dinosaur actors, the only one who ever did anything else notable was Michaela Dietz, who voiced the Riff; even then, she is known for only one other role — Amethyst in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>.
<ul><li> From the feature film, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KylaPratt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KylaPratt">Kyla Pratt</a> was quite popular thanks to her role in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorDolittle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorDolittle">Doctor Dolittle</a></em> movies and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily">The Proud Family</a></em>, and Trevor Morgan has had a reasonably prolific child acting career afterwards. Diana Rice, however, never appeared in another major production again.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the actors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie">American Pie</a></em> didn't go on to do much afterwards, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannonElizabeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannonElizabeth">Shannon Elizabeth</a> seen in the eyes of the public as the most triumphant example. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonBiggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonBiggs">Jason Biggs</a> was previously the franchise's most notorious laughingstock until he landed a memorable role on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack"> Orange Is the New Black</a></em>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArianaGrande" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArianaGrande">Ariana Grande</a>'s only successful role as an actress was as Cat Valentine in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Victorious</a></em> (which she wasn't even the star of).

However, she has transitioned into a pop superstar with numerous hits and certified albums under her belt and has never looked back since. As a musician, she is most certainly <strong>not</strong> a one-hit wonder. In fact, she's easily the most successful music act ever produced by Nickelodeon.
</li><li> Alfonso Ribiero is only known for playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir">Carlton Banks</a>.

Since then, however, he's gotten no other major roles, and is still best known as Jacob in <em>Twilight</em>.
</li><li> Taylor Dooley's only significant role is playing the titular Lavagirl in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfSharkboyAndLavagirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfSharkboyAndLavagirl">The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl</a></em> and nothing else.

While Jana Kramer is nowadays better known as a singer, Alex Dupre remains her only notable acting role.
</li><li> While most actors on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC">The O.C.</a></em> have broken into other roles (or famous beforehand in the case of Tate Donovan), Mischa Barton is mostly known for playing Marissa Cooper. The same goes for Autumn Reaser and Taylor Townsend.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Adam Copeland</a> may have had a long wrestling career, but he's known for one acting role: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven">Haven</a></em>. For a while, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> was in the same situation with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>, but he's now also known for his role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>.
</li><li> Aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland">Judy Garland</a>, the entire main cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> is known exclusively for that one movie:
<ul><li> Ray Bolger was primarily a Broadway actor when he landed the role of the Scarecrow. Because he got caught up doing USO shows overseas, he worked very sporadically in Hollywood throughout the 1940s, only making five films. After that, he hardly got any roles at all, focusing more on TV.
</li><li> Jack Haley, the Tin Man, was a well-known actor not only on film but also on radio and vaudeville. He primarily worked for RKO, so his switch to MGM was an anomaly. While he got more frequent work than Bolger post-<em>Oz</em>, he quit acting after refusing to participate in a version of <em>Seven Keys to Baldpate</em>.
</li><li> Bert Lahr played the Cowardly Lion. Aside from that, his work in Hollywood was scarce and unsuccessful. Like Bolger, he focused primarily on stage acting afterwards.
</li><li> Frank Morgan, who played the title role, was a contracted character actor for MGM, and thus his roles were rarely if ever, leads. Sadly, Morgan died only ten years after <em>Oz</em> at the early age of fifty-nine.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretHamilton">Margaret Hamilton</a>, the Wicked Witch of the West, had a far more successful acting career than most of her co-stars, but she was never quite able to shake off her "Wicked Witch" image. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">self-parodied</a> her role during the last decade before her death.
</li><li> Billie Burke was probably the most successful, as she had been in the acting industry since the 1910s. Burke was a major Ziegfield Follies star and also appeared in other classics like the <em>Topper</em> series and grabbed an Oscar nomination for <em>Merrily We Live</em>. But she'll always be best known as Glinda the Good Witch.
</li></ul></li><li> Hallie Kate Eisenberg appeared in a few movies but is today only remembered for being the "Pepsi Girl" in the company's late-'90s/early 2000s ad campaign. Other than that, she's best known for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JesseEisenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JesseEisenberg">Jesse's sister</a>.
</li><li> Although he had a number of supporting roles before (mostly in Westerns), James Arness remains remembered largely as Marshall Matt Dillon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a></em>, with his filmography after being cast as Dillon being quite limited. He also had a lead role in the TV series of <em>How The West Was Won</em>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">garnered a cult following in Europe</a> but failed to make much of an impact in the US.
</li><li> While her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> co-stars have continued to find success afterward, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseMcGowan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseMcGowan">Rose McGowan</a> is still known mostly as Paige Matthews. Other than that, she's more known for being one of the most visible accusers against Harvey Weinstein for sexual abuse.
</li><li> Ilan Mitchell-Smith will always solely be known for playing the "other" kid in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeirdScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeirdScience">Weird Science</a></em> (Wyatt), though a few might also recognize him as the lead in the film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChocolateWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChocolateWar">The Chocolate War</a></em>. He's now a professor of Medieval Studies at the University of Houston and a major tabletop gamer.
</li><li> The kids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em>. Lecy Goranson will forever be known as the original Becky, although she did have a small role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoysDontCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoysDontCry">Boys Don't Cry</a></em>, all her other roles are in indie films and shorts. Sara Gilbert has had it a little bit better, with recurring roles on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>, along with co-hosting <em>The Talk</em> on CBS, she's still best known as Darlene. DJ is Michael Fishman's only major credit. Averted with Sarah Chalke (Becky in later seasons), who's better known these days for her work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>.
</li><li> Ahney Her, the Chinese girl of Hmong ethnicity who appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GranTorino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GranTorino">Gran Torino</a></em> alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, impressed several critics with her performance. She later appeared in <em>Night Club</em>, a 2011 low budget film that nobody saw despite the presence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestBorgnine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestBorgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MickeyRooney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MickeyRooney">Mickey Rooney</a>, and then nothing else so far.
</li><li> Patrick Renna is best known for his role as Ham in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSandlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSandlot">The Sandlot</a></em> or better yet the Youre killing me Smalls guy.
</li><li> Just like with music, several actors have died before being able to take new roles leading them to this status.
<ul><li> Heather ORourke had just completed the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Poltergeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Poltergeist">Poltergeist</a></em> trilogy when she was misdiagnosed and died at the age of 12.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoryMonteith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoryMonteith">Cory Monteith</a> died of a drug overdose before production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>s fifth season.
</li><li> George Reeves committed suicide not long after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">The Adventures of Superman</a></em> ended. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hollywoodland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hollywoodland">feature film</a> was made around the mysterious circumstances around his death and how his deep-seated fear of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TypeCasting">Typecasting</a> from his role as Superman may have played a role in it.
</li></ul></li><li> Although he made over forty movies, the only film from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudieMurphy">Audie Murphy</a>'s acting career most people remember today is <em>To Hell and Back</em>, which is based on his autobiography. Of course, what he's <em>most</em> famous for is being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Crazy Awesome</a> war hero.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChiakiKuriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChiakiKuriyama">Chiaki Kuriyama</a> can be considered from a Western perspective. She will be forever known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho">homicidal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlWithPsychoWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlWithPsychoWeapon">schoolgirl</a> Gogo Yubari from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill">Kill Bill</a></em>.

She also had a brief singing career which however didn't leave much of an impression.
</li><li> Actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelGough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelGough">Michael Gough</a> (not the voice actor who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">Gopher</a>) had a long career, but he is remembered today almost exclusively as the first actor to play Alfred the Butler in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman</a></em> movies.
</li><li> Briana Evigan, the daughter of television actor Greg Evigan, is mostly known only for her leading role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StepUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StepUp">Step Up</a> 2: The Streets</em>.
</li><li> Creed Bratton had huge musical success with 60s folk-rock group The Grass Roots, but his only notable acting role is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">Adam Westing</a> role on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardBelzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardBelzer">Richard Belzer</a> is only known as Detective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/JohnMunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/JohnMunch">John Munch</a>, though said role technically also make him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder">Two-Hit Wonder</a> as said character was a cast member on two iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedurals</a>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> and appeared in cameos on countless others.

It could be argued that he is also a technical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder">Two-Hit Wonder</a> like Belzer above since he was part of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">the mothership</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>.

They appeared in two other films together, neither of which came close to that success. While Dotrice has continued to occasionally appear in bit parts, Garber never acted again and died of pancreatitis in 1977.

She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Despite the acclaim she got, she chose to follow it up by making critically panned rom coms. This killed her momentum badly and she never regained the stardom she got from her breakout role.

While some of her other work has gained followings, most of that is limited to the <em>Sailor Moon</em> fandom, and she has yet to have any other title match the success of <em>Sailor Moon</em>.

The series went on for 6 years, received an anime, and some movies, and the characters are always used in <em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em> crossovers. He has attempted to write other series, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunBlazeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunBlazeWest">Gun Blaze West</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em>, but they never received enough acceptance to go on for more than two years.

Although this may change, as his current manga, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyashiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Inuyashiki">Inuyashiki</a></em>, is starting to get some fame.

His next creation named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FunnyMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FunnyMan">Funny Man</a></em> is a completely obscure work that only comic book historians would be able to recognize and eventually faded into complete oblivion. They also created several other characters before Superman that are likewise forgotten.
</li><li> Similarly, Bob Kane and Bill Finger's 1939 creation, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a></em> remains their only widely known creation.

That was his only major work in comics, as he became better known for inventing the lie detector.

His next film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ultraviolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a></em> quickly wiped out that fanbase, and he hasn't directed another film since.

Since then, however, they've only directed two more films, which have gotten decent enough receptions but had very limited theatrical releases, with <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em> screenwriter Michael Arndt having been the person who really benefited from that film's success in retrospect.

<ul><li> A strange case: Gerald Mayo was very infamous, for many reasons, in the early 1970s. You should see the number of news articles printed about him at the time; it was <em>huge</em>. Nowadays, he is only known for something he was <em>not</em> famous for in the 1970s: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_ex_rel._Gerald_Mayo_v._Satan_and_His_Staff">suing Satan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Dissatisfaction from some voters over the choice between the unpopular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter">Jimmy Carter</a> and the staunchly right-wing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a> gave Anderson 6% of the final vote, but rather than becoming a major national political figure, he spent the rest of his life being remembered as "the guy who ran against Carter and Reagan".
</li><li> Joe Donnelly was a Democratic congressman from Indiana who representative the conservative blue-collar wing, which was dying off at the time. In 2012 he decided to run for Senate against longtime Republican incumbent Richard Lugar in what many saw as a "sacrificial lamb" campaign rather than a serious challenge, as Indiana was a red state and Lugar was well-liked across the isle. However, he wasnt particularly popular with those in his own party, and he was ousted by the very conservative Tea Party champion Richard Mourdock in the primaries. This caused some headaches with the Indiana GOP, which culminated in a statement in which he said that rape victims should not get abortions because babies were a gift from god. Mourdocks campaign crashed and Donnelly scored the upset win. The win was, by all intentions a fluke, and the next time the seat was up, Donnelly lost by five points to state legislator Mike Braun.
</li><li> During the 2010 senate cycle, Republicans channeled anger at President Obama to pick up two Senate seats in very liberal states. Scott Brown won a special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy, taking advantage of its irregular timing in January and relatively low turnout to win. Meanwhile, Mark Kirk picked up the Illinois senate seat that was once held by Obama himself by defeating a weak Democratic challenger. Both went on to lose badly the next time the seats were up, both in presidential years. Brown was defeated by Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts and Kirk was ousted by Tammy Duckworth in Illinois. Brown tried to make a comeback Senate bid in neighboring New Hampshire, considerably redder territory in a year favoring the GOP, but ultimately fell short.

<ul><li> Jimmy Glass, the English football player responsible for keeping Carlisle United F.C. in the Football League by scoring a goal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">in the last seconds of the final match</a> of the 1998-99 season against Plymouth Argyle F.C. Made all the more remarkable by the fact that he was Carlisle's goalkeeper, and thus would ordinarily have been at the opposite end of the pitch, and at the time he was an emergency loan signing from Swindon Town F.C. which had to receive special approval because Carlisle had run out of goalkeepers. He only ever played three matches for Carlisle, who were unable to negotiate a long-term contract for Glass, and he returned to Swindon and retired two years later. His subsequent biography was titled <em>One-Hit Wonder</em>. For people who don't understand football, he was basically playing in one of the lowest professional divisions in England, had an otherwise unremarkable career as a player, and after having his contract expire, retired to become an office worker.
</li><li> On 7 May 2003, Arsenal beat Southampton 6-1, with 19-year old Jermaine Pennant scoring a hat-trick on his first ever league appearance for the club. The match would later become notable as the first game of a 49-game unbeaten run by Arsenal, the longest ever in English football. Pennant, however, would never score another goal for the club.
</li><li> Roger Maris, forever known as the man who hit 61 home runs, isn't even in the Hall of Fame because other than his MVP years of 1960 and '61 (the year which he hit 61 homers), he was an above-average but hardly spectacular baseball player.
</li><li> Washington Redskins rookie running back Timmy Smith was only in the starting lineup for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> XXII due to injuries to the Redskins' other running backs. Smith made the most of that opportunity, rushing for a Super Bowl record 204 yards with two touchdowns in the Skins' 42-10 victory over the Denver Broncos. Smith's career lasted only 15 more games before he was out of the NFL in 1990.
<ul><li> Similarly, David Tyree of the New York Giants. A bottom of the depth chart receiver who managed to catch a ball from Eli Manning by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet_Catch">pinning it to his helmet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and never did anything else of note.
</li><li> Buffalo Bills kicker Scott Norwood is a unique example, being known for one failure rather than an accomplishment. Norwood is famous for a missed 47-yard field goal at the end of Super Bowl XXV, and pretty much nothing else.
</li><li> Mike Jones of the St. Louis Rams is basically defined for <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_play_of_Super_Bowl_XXXIV">a tackle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> he made of Titans receiver Kevin Dyson stopping him from scoring the game-tying touchdown at the one-yard line.
</li></ul></li><li> Dick Shiner was a career backup quarterback. During a stint with the Atlanta Falcons, he became the first quarterback to officially achieve a perfect passer rating, when he led the Falcons to a 62-7 victory over the New Orleans Saints. He also set the record for highest score in a football game that the Falcons have reached. This is the only thing he ever did of note - he was a career second stringer who had one brilliant game.
</li><li> Bucky Dent was a solid defensive shortstop and a decent situational hitter. However, all he will ever be known for, especially in Boston, is the home run he hit for the Yankees in 1978 that knocked the Red Sox out of playoff contention that year and winning the World Series MVP that same year.
<ul><li> To young non-Yankee/Red Sox fans he may best known for being in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Steinbrenner rant</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, Carlton Fisk may be a Hall of Fame player with the Red Sox, but his entire career has been defined by his home run off the foul pole in the 1975 World Series.
<ul><li> Enough so that most casual baseball fans (at least outside Chicago's South Side) forget that Fisk spent the majority of his career with the White Sox.
</li></ul></li><li> This seems to be the fate of any player who comes up big in a high-profile situation. Other players defined by World Series moments include Bill Wambsganss (a solid defensive second baseman best known for turning an unassisted triple play in the 1920 World Series—still the only triple play of any kind in World Series history), Don Larsen (a journeyman pitcher who pitched a perfect game in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series—was the only no-hitter of any kind in postseason history for 54 years), and Cookie Lavagetto (pinch-hit two-run walkoff double in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series, which also broke up what <em>would</em> have been the first no-hitter in World Series history, as the two baserunners he drove in reached via walks—the ninth and tenth allowed by starter Bill Bevens. Also, neither Bevens nor Lavagetto played in the major leagues after 1947.)
</li><li> Jack Morris's 10-inning shutout for the Twins in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series completely overshadowed the rest of his excellent career; this one game was so epic that hardly anyone remembers that Morris was also the ace of <em>the following year's champion</em>, the Toronto Blue Jays. Then again, he was also the ace of the Detroit Tigers earlier in his career.
</li><li> The ultimate baseball one-moment wonder might be Francisco Cabrera of the 1992 Atlanta Braves. The Braves were one out away from being eliminated in the NLCS when they sent Cabrera, the last position player left on the bench, up to bat. Cabrera could barely even be considered a part-time player; he only had ten at-bats during the regular season and only one prior at-bat in the playoffs. He stroked a two-run single to put the Braves in the World Series, then immediately faded back to obscurity. He was out of the majors the following year.
</li><li> Armando Galarraga catapulted into the headlines after umpire Jim Joyce's blown call cost him a perfect game (retire 27 batters in order without allowing any of them to reach base) in July 2010. Since then he's had nothing but hard luck - cut by 3 teams, kicked around the minors, and barely had the proverbial "cup of coffee" in the bigs since.
<ul><li> Also Jason Donald is known for that one "hit".
</li></ul></li><li> Luis Gonzalez had a respectable career as a member of the Diamondbacks, but ask if they know who he is and they'll probably say he's the guy whose walk-off single ended the 2001 World Series.
</li><li> Kirk Gibson was a two-time MVP and World Series Champion, but he is best known for hitting a pinch-hit walk-off homer off Dennis Eckersley in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The main reason he's known is that he had been vomiting all day and could barely walk due to both his illness and lingering leg injuries, and didn't appear again in the series.
</li><li> Former Pirates second baseman Bill Mazeroski. While he eventually made the Hall of Fame, he's known almost exclusively for the walkoff home run he hit in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, which will likely never be forgotten due to the remarkable statistical fluke that the series produced. In Game 1, the Yankees outhit the Pirates 13-8 but lost 6-4, and in Game 4 they again outhit the Pirates 8-7 but lost 3-2, and in the deciding Game 7, Mazeroski's home run leading off the bottom of the ninth, breaking a <em>9-9</em> tie, was just the Pirates' 11th, to the Yankees' 13. So even in three of their four <em>victories</em>, the Pirates were outhit. "Even" in their victories, that is, because the Yankees won Games 2, 3, and 6 by the scores of <em>16-3, 10-0, and 12-0</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0p0ke');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0p0ke" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0p0ke');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Oddly enough, the Pirates had more hits in the 16-3 loss than in any of their four wins.</span> The result was a Series in which the Yankees scored 55 runs on 91 hits, batting .338 as a team—just a few of the many records they set—and <em>lost</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a>:
<ul><li> Jacques Villeneuve took the World Championship in only his second year in the sport in 1997, then proceeded to never win another race. He has found success in other forms of racing, though.
</li><li> Jean Alesi was an even more literal example of this. He only won a single race in F1 and even that was considered a lucky (although popular) win. Despite his talent being obvious to all who saw him race, a mixture of poor luck and lackluster machinery contributed to denying him further wins.
</li><li> Venezuelan driver Pastor Maldonado scored one Formula One race win in a career otherwise known for spectacular crashes.
</li></ul></li><li> Trevor Bayne surprised everyone by winning the 2011 Daytona 500, just his second start in NASCAR's top level of competition. He has yet to score a follow-up win and lost his ride with Roush-Fenway Racing at the end of the 2018 season.
</li><li> Many cricket fans consider the late Sir Donald Bradman's Test cricket batting average of 99.94 (across 80 innings) to be the greatest statistical achievement in any sport, but in cricket statistics, it's customary to consider Test averages only from players who have played more than 20 innings. Cricket's highest Test batting average technically belongs to a one-hit wonder, West Indian wicketkeeper Andy Ganteaume, who was called up for a single Test against England in 1948 and scored 112 runs in his one and only innings at the crease.
</li><li> Salvatore "Totò" Schillaci was the star of the 1990 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">World Cup</a>, scoring six goals (the top scorer) and bringing Italy to third place  amazingly, he only ever scored one other goal for Italy, and apart from Italia 90 the rest of his career was unremarkable.
<ul><li> The same could be said about Fabio Grosso, the man who almost single-handedly brought Italy to victory in the 2006 World Cup. He scored all the important goals, including the one in the semifinal and the decisive penalty kick in the final match, but never did anything else of note in his home country.
</li></ul></li><li> Oleg Salenko, who played for the Russian national team in the 1994 World Cup. During the 1994 World Cup, he scored 5 goals in a game against Cameroon (the most goals anyone has scored in a single World Cup match) and 6 goals overall, the joint top scorer of the tournament (and the only time where a top scorer played for a team that was knocked out in the group stages). The 6 goals turned out to be the only goals of his national team career.
</li><li> Prior to 2004, the Greek national team had only qualified for two tournaments (the 1980 European Championships, and the 1994 World Cup), and been officially ranked the worst team at the tournament at both. Then they miraculously won the 2004 European Championships. Since then, they have been unable to get past the first knockout round of any tournament. Greece won more games at Euro 2004 than they have won at all other tournaments before or since combined.
</li><li> Joe Johnson was a previously unremarkable and little-known snooker player who suddenly hit form in the 1986 World Championship, taking the title having never previously advanced beyond the first round. It was his only ranking event win; despite making the final again the following year, he slipped down the rankings quite swiftly thereafter.
</li><li> On February 11, 1990, 42-1 underdog James "Buster" Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson, who was an undefeated champion at the time. (For some perspective, this was the first time Tyson had even been knocked down.) He retired just a few months later, after losing the heavyweight title to Evander Holyfield.
</li><li> When Holly Holm beat the previously thought to be invincible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey">Ronda Rousey</a>, it was called the biggest upset since Douglas/Tyson. And not only did Holm win, but she also did so so convincingly she had MMA fans convinced she was the second coming. Her first defense of the Women's Bantamweight Championship, she lost to Rousey's arch-rival Miesha Tate. Since defeating Rousey she's gone 2-5, with her two wins being over undercard talent<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note952e4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note952e4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note952e4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">to be fair to Holm here, in her loss to Germaine de Randamie to crown the first Women's Featherweight Champion, Randamie repeatedly punched her after the bell and wasn't penalized for it</span>. Her one feat, being the first person to go the distance with Cris "Cyborg" Justino, became far less impressive after Amanda Nunes KO'd Cyborg in under a minute in Cyborg's very next match. Also, Nunes beat Holm in 4 minutes in July 2019.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> fighter Matt Serra had a decent MMA career, even winning <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUltimateFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUltimateFighter">The Ultimate Fighter</a></em>, but he is only known for knocking out Georges St Pierre, considered by many to be the greatest upset in the sport's history. He lost his first title defense never got another significant win.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball">Australian Rules Football</a>, the St Kilda Saints have won only one premiership, in 1966. The same goes for Port Adelaide Power (2004), but they are generally not considered to be this since they only joined in 1997, and their SANFL incarnation is the most successful club in that league. The Western Bulldogs long had the "one-hit wonder" tag as well, having only won the premiership in 1954, but they picked up their second flag in 2016.
<ul><li> Among players, the most famous one-hit wonder would be Ted Hopkins, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutMeInCoach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutMeInCoach">brought on after half time</a> for Carlton in the 1970 Grand Final, and proceeded to rip Collingwood to shreds as Carlton <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally">came back from a 44-point deficit to win</a>. Afterward, Hopkins realised he could never do anything to top his achievements in that game, and retired.
</li></ul></li><li> Several professional golfers who have risen from obscurity and win (or even just nearly win) a major championship have had difficulty sustaining that success in smaller-level tournaments afterward. Among the notable champions on this list are Steve Jones (1996 U.S. Open), Shaun Micheel (2003 PGA Championship) and Hilary Lunke (2003 U.S. Women's Open, her only <em>top ten</em> in an LPGA tournament).
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">tennis</a>, players who win just one Grand Slam title in their careers are labeled (fairly or unfairly) as "one-Slam wonders". The biggest one of them is probably Gastón Gaudio, who won the 2004 French Open  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally">recovering from a 2-set deficit</a>, no less  but failed to reach the quarterfinals of any other Slam he entered.
<ul><li> Goran Ivanisevic was consistently one of the best players in the world in the 1990s (ranked as high as No. 2 at points), but despite making the Wimbledon final three times in the decade, he lost all three. Injuries and declining performances left him ranked outside the top 100 and struggling to qualify for major tournaments by 2001, and most thought his best was well behind him. Then, he was given a wild card entry into the 2001 Wimbledon draw - and won the competition, his only Grand Slam title. He never got past the third round of a tournament (any tournament, not just Grand Slams) again, and retired a couple of years later.
</li><li> Prior to reforms in 1982, most top tennis players, especially in the women's game, skipped the Australian due to inconvenient dates, the long journey, and comparatively low prize money. One of the last female winners prior to the reforms was the American Barbara Jordan, who won in 1979. Jordan won no other singles titles, never got past the last 32 at any other Slam, and never even ranked inside the world top 50.
</li><li> Iva Majoli and Anastasia Myskina both won the French Open, in 1997 and 2004 respectively. Neither managed to get beyond the quarterfinals in any other slam.
</li><li> Martin Verkerk entered the 2003 French Open at the age of 24, having only previously qualified for two Grand Slams, in both of which he went out in the first round. Then he rapidly became a popular phenomenon as he reached the final of the tournament. He then played at only five more slams (only once even reaching the last 32), before a career-ending injury.
</li></ul></li><li> Roy Essandoh, a previously anonymous lower-league soccer player, is mostly known for scoring a winning goal for Wycombe Wanderers against Leicester City in 2001 after he answered a teletext ad by then-manager Lawrie Sanchez for a non-cup-tied striker. That goal propelled Wycombe to an FA Cup semifinal, after which Roy slipped back into obscurity.
</li><li> Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox threw a perfect game at the start of the 2012 then proceeded to suck for the rest of the season. He became the only player to throw a perfect game and be released (although claimed by another team) at the end of the next season. If he's mentioned for anything else, it'll be how he was traded for Johan Santana. He did win a College World Series (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NCAA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NCAA">NCAA</a> Division I championship) with Rice University, so not all is lost.
</li><li> Dallas Braden, pitcher for the Oakland A's, is only known for two things: yelling at Alex Rodriguez during a game and getting a perfect game two weeks later.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-brady-andersons-of-the-nhl/">Among NHL examples<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an outstanding case is Jonathan Cheechoo, who may have been a solid NHL player, but his 56-goal Richard Trophy winning season couldn't be matched, and he's bounced around from the NHL and minors.
</li><li> Running back Jonas Grey will probably never have another performance as he did in a game with the Patriots where he ran for 201 and 4 touchdowns. To put things into perspective, he didn't play the next game at all for breaking team rules.
</li><li> Running back Jerome Harrison is known for a single game in 2009 where he rushed for 286 yards, breaking the Cleveland Browns' single game rushing record, which was held by the legendary Jim Brown.
</li><li> Chris Johnson is best known for his 2009 season with the Tennessee Titans where he rushed for 2000 yards.
<ul><li> Interestingly there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTHeSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTHeSame">a Chris Johnson in baseball</a> who's also a one-hit wonder. The Atlanta Braves third baseman had a career year in 2013 which led to him winning a batting title before returning to his normal self the following season.
</li></ul></li><li> Eric Bruntlett hit a World Series-clinching win for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2008, and performed only the 15th unassisted triple play in history in 2009 at 31 years old. A year later, he was out of baseball entirely.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_Ramblers_men%27s_basketball">Loyola University<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of Chicago won the NCAA men's basketball championship in 1963 but fell into mediocrity between that and their 2018 Final Four run.
<ul><li> College basketball's other great Loyola moment, when <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_Marymount_Lions_men%27s_basketball">Loyola Marymount<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> made an emotional run to the Elite Eight in 1990, after their star Hank Gathers collapsed and died during a conference tournament game. After that season, their other star Bo Kimble graduated and coach Paul Westhead took an NBA job, and LMU hasn't been back to the tournament since.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note101x6p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note101x6p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note101x6p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In more recent times, LMU isn't helped by Gonzaga becoming utterly dominant in its home of the West Coast Conference, with only Saint Mary's and later WCC arrival <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">BYU</a> providing anything approaching a challenge.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Saeed Al-Owairan, known as the "Maradona of the Arabs" for his Maradona-like goal in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">the 1994 FIFA World Cup</a>, and nothing else.
</li><li> Anselmo, Brazilian footballer for Flamengo, in the 1981 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CopaLibertadores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CopaLibertadores">Copa Libertadores</a>. In the finals of Flamengo (Brazil) and Cobreloa (Chile), Chilean defender Mario Soto was giving a class of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness">Unnecessary Roughness</a>, leaving two Flamengo players bleeding removing other two players from injuries. In the last game, with four minutes left and victory already guaranteed to Flamengo, the team's coach Cláudio Coutinho decided to avenge the previous game and put benchwarmer Anselmo in the field, with the sole intention of hitting Soto. Anselmo then promptly entered the game and punched Soto in the face, causing a fight between both players and their subsequently expulsion. When Flamengo returned home, Anselmo was received by the supporters with chants of <em>Anselmo Vingador</em> ("Anselmo the avenger"). After his career in Flamengo <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ogol.com.br/jogador.php?id=133053">Anselmo bounced around a few clubs and playing a total of 28 games<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> until retiring in 1990.

<ul><li> He worked for Microsoft's games division for a while in the late '90s and early 2000s, creating critically acclaimed puzzle games like <em>Pandora's Box</em> and <em>Hexic</em> that met with commercial indifference, even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InCaseYouForgotWhoWroteIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InCaseYouForgotWhoWroteIt">his semi-famous name was played up in advertising.</a>

Acknowledging this, Day 1 set to developed a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/F2P" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/F2P">F 2 P</a> mech game titled <em>Reigns of Thunder</em> (whose teaser trailed advertised it as "Day 1 going back to its roots"), but the studio was then bought by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">Wargaming</a> and refocused on porting Wargaming's games to other platforms.

</li><li> Although CCP Games has made several attempts to expand their brand beyond the wildly successful <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline">EVE Online</a></em> (2003), so far, all have been failures.

All of their subsequent games were massive failures, with their last game (<em>Uncle Henry's Playhouse</em>) selling a whopping 27 copies in the U.S.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Suda51" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Suda51">Suda51</a> is known for his wacky games that while they have a cult following, their appeal is limited.

The rest of his games are lucky if they break the 500,000 mark.
</li><li> Vigil Games made only two games, the first of which, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders">Darksiders</a></em>, was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a>. Then they made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarksidersII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarksidersII">Darksiders II</a></em>, which was a commercial failure that resulted in the studio being left to die when THQ folded in early 2013.

</li><li> Asmik Ace Entertainment is mostly known as a film distributor, but their video game success comes from developing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LSDDreamEmulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LSDDreamEmulator">LSD: Dream Emulator</a></em>, thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuSato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuSato">Osamu Sato</a></em> and his status of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> artist.

Their company, Jagex, has made a few other games, although without the Gowers, but even they are mostly known just for <em>Runescape</em>.
</li><li> Stellar Stone released eight games during the early 2000s before dissolving entirely, including a pinball game, two real-time strategies, a puzzle game, a first-person shooter, and three racing games, pretty much all of which were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Betas</a> in every sense of the word. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that knows this, and in fact, most of the Internet would have you believe the only game of theirs of this nature was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BigRigsOverTheRoadRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BigRigsOverTheRoadRacing">Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing</a></em>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThurlRavenscroft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThurlRavenscroft">Thurl Ravenscroft</a> was one of the most influential voice artists of all time, with a very large amount of roles (including the Christmas classic "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas">You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch</a>") and being revered in the voice acting community; but for mainstream audiences, he will forever be best-known as Tony the Tiger, for bellowing "They're <em>gr-r-r-reat!</em>" on cereal commercials.
<ul><li> To be fair, he is also commonly confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> thanks to his appearance as a singing bust in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheHauntedMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheHauntedMansion">The Haunted Mansion</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong">as well as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff">Boris Karloff</a> for "Mr. Grinch".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Stephanie Nadolny's big claim to fame is as Kid Goku and Gohan in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise. She's had other anime roles though, including lead roles in shows like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gravion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gravion">Gravion Zwei</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Parasite Dolls</a>, and one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII">Lupin III</a> feature, but she'll always be known for her work in <em>Dragon Ball</em>.
<ul><li> She also voiced the title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></em>, but only for a few episodes before Courtenay Taylor would take over, so she's still known pretty much only for <em>Dragon Ball Z.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Tiffany Vollmer, who voiced Bulma, had no other major voice roles. Her only other roles <em>period</em> include a two-episode bit character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> and additional voices in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>. She has since moved away, and Bulma is now voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonicaRial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonicaRial">Monica Rial</a>.
</li><li> Jeremy Inman is also known mostly for only one role; in his case, it is Android 16, although he's voiced many other supporting roles in the series and in other shows.
</li><li> Same with Phil Parsons and Nappa. Despite having credits in some other shows, Nappa is all anyone knows him for.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaraEdwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaraEdwards">Kara Edwards</a> was this for years, only being known for voicing Kid Goten and Videl, and pretty much retired from voice acting in anime. However a few years ago, she experienced a comeback of sorts and is voicing leads in other anime as well.
</li><li> Elise Baughman's only major anime role is Pan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, though she voiced smaller roles in other shows for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> around the same time. Nowadays, however, she <em>only</em> gets work voicing Pan in various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> video games, although she also returned to voice Momiji's mother in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> reboot.
</li><li> Julie Franklin voiced Agent Mai in the original <em>Dragon Ball</em>, and her cameo in <em>GT</em>. That remains her only named role, her only other credits being background voices and bit parts in <em>Dragon Ball</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>. At that time, she was dating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat">Christopher Sabat</a>.

</li><li> Monika Antonelli's only anime credits are Puar and Chiaotzu in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise (and some odd bit parts in the series here and there).

</li></ul></li><li> Maile Flanagan is known for voicing the title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> and little else (except <em>maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LabRats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LabRats">Lab Rats</a></em>). Though she won a Daytime Emmy for voicing the title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JakersTheAdventuresOfPiggleyWinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JakersTheAdventuresOfPiggleyWinks">Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks</a></em>, a preschool cartoon, and has some bit on-camera parts, <em>Naruto</em> is her only major anime role (her only other anime work period was additional voices on the 2003 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em>).
<ul><li> Tom Gibis voiced Shikamaru Nara and hasn't done anything else of note.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> Akane is Myriam Sirois' only major voice acting role, although she had roles in live-action shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>. She retired from acting in 2008 to become a flight attendant.
</li><li> Boy-type Ranma's original voice actress Sarah Strange had only a couple other small voice roles (with Ranma being her only <em>anime</em> role) and left the series after the third season to focus on her fairly successful live-action television career. Afterwards, Ranma was voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardIanCox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardIanCox">Richard Ian Cox</a>.
</li><li> Brigitta Dau's only anime role is girl-type Ranma in the first 6 episodes of the anime and first two OVA episodes. Though she also had a role in the '90s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> cartoon and some small on-camera roles, <em>Ranma</em> is all she's recognized for. She moved away after her stint on the show, and Venus Terzo (a well-established voice actress) took over her role.
</li><li> Nabiki Tendo is Angela Costain's only voice role and one of her very few acting roles before she became a pilot. The same can be said for her sister, Elaina Wotten-Costain, who filled in during Season 6.
</li></ul></li><li> Many voice actors in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> franchise, since it was one of the first to use Union voice actors.
<ul><li> Ryoko is Petrea Burchard's only major animation role, with her only other role period being a bit part on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em>. She also had some minor on-camera parts.
</li><li> Matt Miller, who voiced Tenchi, had some other anime roles, but Tenchi is his only lead and only claim to fame. He's mostly a stage actor.
</li><li> Ellen Gerstell's only anime role is the original voice of <em>Mihoshi</em> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RebeccaForstadt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RebeccaForstadt">Rebecca Forstadt</a> took over following her retirement. She had some roles in western animation, however, notably Rapture in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>, Sharon Becker and Leah Applebaum, the voices of Anthy and Nanami respectively, have no other major voice roles. Leah's only other roles period are a few small roles in early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> episodes.
</li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, Sarah Natochenny, the current voice of Ash, has no major roles in any other anime titles. Most of her other work is in fashion modeling and some on-camera roles. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor">Veronica Taylor</a> (his original voice) however, is a very prominent anime and video game voice actress.
<ul><li> Lee Quick's only major anime credit was the original voice of Officer Jenny, with small roles in only three other shows. Her first replacement, Jamie Davyous Owens, has no other anime credits.
</li><li> Matthew Sussman had some other acting credits but is mostly known for being the original Meowth.
</li><li> Emily Bauer is mostly known for being the voice of Dawn and not much else.
</li><li> Jay Goede, the voice of Mewtwo and his creator Dr. Fuji who went under the pseudonym Phillip Bartlett, has had no other voice acting roles to date, he is mostly a stage actor and has had some on-camera roles in films and television shows.
</li></ul></li><li> Almost the entire cast of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> dub from DiC and Cloverway, since anime is very rarely recorded in Toronto. Many of the actors have other roles in western animation and live-action though.
</li><li> Mimi Woods had a handful of anime and video game voice acting roles in the '90s, but her only major role was Major Motoko Kusanagi in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> film and video game. She has since moved away from Los Angeles and retired from voice acting in 2001. Since then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryElizabethMcGlynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryElizabethMcGlynn">Mary Elizabeth McGlynn</a> has voiced the Major in most other <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> media.
</li><li> Another anime example is Adam Conlon, who was Kouta in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>. He had a handful of other anime roles for ADV, but that was his only lead, and all he's been remembered for. He was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">replaced</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlakeShepard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlakeShepard">Blake Shepard</a> when the OVA was finally dubbed in 2013.
</li><li> Several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> voice actors including Melanie MacQueen (Lisa Hayes in <em>Macross</em>), Robin Levenson (Sammie Porter in <em>Macross</em>), and Melissa Newman (Dana Sterling in <em>Masters</em>). Carl Macek even acknowledged that he hadn't had contact with Newman since the show ended, and he didn't know what happened to her. However, MacQueen also played "Lady Luck" in a long series of commercials for the Virginia Lottery, and is somewhat well-known for that too.
</li><li> Blossom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> is Cathy Cavadini's only major animation role, though she's had supporting parts in other shows, games, and films.
<ul><li> Jennifer Martin, on the other hand, has barely done anything except for Ms. Sara Bellum, which hasn't gotten better due to said character being written out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016">the reboot</a>.

</li><li> The lead <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Simpsons</a></em> voice actors:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a> (Homer) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NancyCartwright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NancyCartwright">Nancy Cartwright</a> (Bart) are both very prolific voice actors with a few scattered live-action roles. However, none of their characters are nearly as iconic as their <em>Simpsons</em> roles; Castellaneta is next-best known for replacing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a> as the Genie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em>.

</li><li> Yeardley Smith (Lisa) has this the worst. Apart from a couple of one-off characters that are similar to Lisa, she does not play any other voice roles on <em>The Simpsons</em>. Her only other major leading role came with 1993's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WereBackADinosaursStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WereBackADinosaursStory">We're Back!

She does occasionally work as an on-camera actress with bit parts in several popular movies (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLegendOfBillieJean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLegendOfBillieJean">The Legend of Billie Jean</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AsGoodAsItGets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AsGoodAsItGets">As Good as It Gets</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitySlickers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitySlickers">City Slickers</a></em>), and a supporting role in the now-forgotten cult sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HermansHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HermansHead">Herman's Head</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Roy Conrad is best known as the voice of Ben, the protagonist from cult adventure game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FullThrottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FullThrottle">Full Throttle</a></em>, and beyond a few scattered voice-over roles for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts">LucasArts</a></em> games and on-screen extra roles, not much else.

They all had some scattered live-action credits, but nothing nearly as remembered. Completely averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreyDeLisle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreyDeLisle">Grey DeLisle</a> (Daphne #4), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKayBergman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKayBergman">Mary Kay Bergman</a> (Daphne #3), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BJWard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BJWard">BJ Ward</a> (Velma #4) and Kate Micucci (Velma #6). Mindy Cohn (Velma #5) is a mixed example, with Velma being her only major voice role, but being just as recognized for her live-action role as Natalie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFactsOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFactsOfLife">The Facts of Life</a></em>.

</li><li> Thom Huge performed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials">Garfield Specials</a> (except <em>Here Comes Garfield</em>) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> as Jon Arbuckle, Binky the Clown, Roy the Rooster, Gort the pig and assorted minor roles, but has no other credits. Justified, as he was actually an employee of Paws, Inc. (Jim Davis's company in Indiana) who apparently was meant to be a stand-in voice, but did such a great job that they didn't want to replace him.
</li><li> Most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> cast from 1998 to 2004, as voice acting is <em>rarely</em> done in San Diego. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStJohn">Jon St. John</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaniMinella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaniMinella">Lani Minella</a> are the only exceptions, as their video game credits are a mile long.
</li><li> Most people only know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesMartinet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesMartinet">Charles Martinet</a> as the voice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario (and Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, etc.)</a> This has changed somewhat since the advent of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>, however, where he voices the hugely popular Paarthurnax; probably the only thing keeping him from being candidate for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHitWonder">Two-Hit Wonder</a> instead is the fact that because Paarthurnax is so different from his other roles, many people don't realize it's him.

<ul><li> Jessie Flower, who voiced Toph, hasn't done much since <em>Avatar</em> wrapped up either.
</li><li> Janet Varney, who played the title star of sequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, is also known only for that one role.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans">The Backyardigans</a></em>, LaShawn Jefferies seems to be known almost exclusively as the speaking voice of Uniqua. She did play a character named Christmas in the film <em>Whitepaddy</em>, but other than that, she's only got Uniqua.
</li><li> Almost any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyPrincess">Disney Princess</a> voice actress:
<ul><li> Adriana Casselotti, the voice of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White</a></em>, has no other acting or voice acting credits, except as an additional voice in the song "If I Only Had a Heart" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>. This is largely because Walt Disney himself put a clause in her contract that forbade her from ever doing any other work in the entertainment industry so as not to "spoil the illusion of Snow White."
</li><li> Ilene Woods' only role of note was as the title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em>.
</li><li> Mary Costa is known as the voice of Princess Aurora in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em>, and not much else. To make matters worse, Aurora herself only had a handful of lines, with the part mostly being through singing.
</li><li> Jodi Benson comes the closest to averting this as a strictly voice actress, since she's had some decent success doing voices for several cartoons, but she will always be known as the voice of Ariel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">The Little Mermaid</a></em>.

</li><li> Paige O'Hara's only major role is Belle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em>. Most of her other work is on Broadway.
</li><li> Linda Larkin, the speaking voice of Jasmine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> has no other major credits. Her <em>singing</em> voice however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeaSalonga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeaSalonga">Lea Salonga</a>, has had much more success as a singer for other Disney characters, as well as a career on Broadway, and is one of the most successful Filipino singers of all time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em>'s speaking and singing voice actresses, Irene Bedard and Judy Kuhn respectively, have no other claims to fame, though Kuhn had a decent career on Broadway and a couple Tony nominations.
</li><li> Averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan">Mulan</a></em>'s voice actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MingNaWen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MingNaWen">Ming-Na Wen</a>, who was also Chun-Li in the live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> film, Jing Mei Chen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>, and is currently Agent May in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>, for which she might actually be <em>better</em> known now. Mulan's singing voice was the above-mentioned Lea Salonga.
</li><li> Also averted with Anika Noni Rose as Tiana in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em>, who's probably better known for her Broadway career and her role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamgirls">Dreamgirls</a></em>.
</li><li> Rapunzel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Tangled</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MandyMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MandyMoore">Mandy Moore</a>'s only major voice acting role (though Aerith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> comes close), but she was already known for her singing career.
</li><li> Lastly, Elsa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdinaMenzel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdinaMenzel">Idina Menzel</a>'s only voice role, but her Broadway career is her biggest claim to fame.

</li><li> Rob Wiethoff voiced John Marston in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> before retiring from acting to focus on raising his family.
</li><li> Rapper Chris "Young Maylay" Bellard never had a hit single, but he did have one very memorable voice acting performance: Carl "CJ" Johnson in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>.

His only other credits were a few cameo appearances in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> franchise and minor motion capture in lower-profile games.
</li><li> Ellen McLain will always be known as GLaDOS in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> franchise. She's done some bit voice acting in other Valve games and had a memorable cameo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">Pacific Rim</a></em>, but nothing major.
</li><li> Christopher Robin Miller's only known role to many fans is the title character in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLayton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLayton">Professor Layton</a></em> series. Nothing else he's done so far has come close.
</li><li> Since video games are rarely recorded in Seattle, the original cast of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports">Backyard Sports</a></em> series never really did much afterwards (except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenTaylor">Jen Taylor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Mark Lund, and Dex Manley</a>).
</li><li> Aside from a few audiobooks, David Kolin's only voice acting role or any other acting role for that matter was the voice of Felix the Cat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelixTheCatTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelixTheCatTheMovie">Felix the Cat: The Movie</a></em>.

Everything else is cult at best, and the one that isn't (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a>) is a forgotten dub that isn't even on DVD.
</li><li> Except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyYongBosch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyYongBosch">Johnny Yong Bosch</a> (one of anime's most prolific voice actors), the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YoKaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YoKaiWatch">Yo Kai Watch</a></em> has hardly done anything else of note.
</li><li> All of the lead voice actors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaraStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaraStrong">Tara Strong</a> (Twilight Sparkle) and maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CathyWeseluck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CathyWeseluck">Cathy Weseluck</a> (Spike) are known outside Canada almost exclusively for that one series, as most of their roles are anime dubs, obscure shows and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest">roles that</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">were replaced</a>.

</li><li> Ironically, despite being a major Anime VA, and a former Vancouver resident during its golden age, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErinFitzgerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErinFitzgerald">Erin Fitzgerald</a>'s only major Western Animation roles, May and Nazz, are both in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddnEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddnEddy">Ed Eddn Eddy</a></em>.

</li><li> Jeremy Shada is so far known pretty much only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Finn</a>.
</li><li> Jason Ritter, the son of the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRitter">John Ritter</a>, has played bit parts on TV shows and movies for most of his career, with only a few leading roles, but most people will be hard-pressed to name any role of his other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Dipper Pines</a>.
</li><li> Kaitlyn Dias voiced Riley in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut">Inside Out</a></em> and afterwards went back to doing low-profile short films.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewtonPittman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewtonPittman">Newton Pittman</a> is only known for voicing Gray Fullbuster in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>. He's had some supporting, guest, and minor roles for other shows for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a>, but Gray is his only lead. His last non-Fairy Tail credit was in 2015, meaning that Gray is the only voice work he's getting right now. This is largely because voice acting is not his main career. According to Newt himself, most of his work is in microbiology and cardiac ICU, and that voice acting is just something he does on the side for fun.
</li><li> When Alison Lohman voiced the title role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a></em>, she was a rising star with roles in small films and two short-lived TV shows.

These days, she might be best known as Nausicaä, which is unheard of for any other "celebrity" cast in a Disney Ghibli dub.

</li><li> Ted Whitney's only major acting credit was as King Terenas Menethil II in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> III</em>, a role often misattributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyJay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyJay">Tony Jay</a>.
</li><li> Except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyWest">Billy West</a> (Doug Funnie and Roger Klotz in the Nick era), almost <em>everybody</em> who voice acted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> has no other notable credits because mainstream voice acting is rarely done in New York City.

None of the main cast has any other anime credits, except for Sinda Nichols (Priss) and Susan Grillo (Nene) having one other credit each. The only actor from the dub still working today is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelSinterniklaas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelSinterniklaas">Michael Sinterniklaas</a>, who voiced background characters and small roles (notably young Mackie).

<ul><li> The book of the same name from which the film was adapted goes to great lengths to show just how absurd a situation this put the protagonist and his father in: the protagonist gets angry and depressed every time he hears the song being sung by buskers, and his father, absolutely desperate to be taken seriously as a musician, once writes an entire musical in the course of one day.
