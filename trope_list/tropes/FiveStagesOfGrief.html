</div></div><p>Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a famed Swiss psychiatrist, noticed that many of her patients who were terminally ill exhibited as many as five stages of grief. This became well-known in pop culture as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubler-Ross_model">Kübler-Ross model,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and it contains the following stages:

</li><li><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">Anger</a>: This isn't right! I DON'T DESERVE THIS!

</li></ol><p>Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych">Hollywood being what it is</a>, when it gives this model of grief, all five stages of grief are displayed, always in this order, and if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialSymptomSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialSymptomSyndrome">all within ten seconds of each other</a>. This despite the fact that Kübler-Ross herself admitted that not all patients went through all five stages, and not all of them went through them in that order; she also originally focused strictly on how the terminally ill came to terms with their own impending deaths, which may or may not adhere more closely to the pattern. This raises the question, given by one critic, of how exactly they can be called stages if they're not universal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim">But that's a discussion for somewhere else</a>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">real life</a>, in the words of Kübler-Ross herself, "our grief is as individual as our lives." Death, of course, is but one trigger.

Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych">in Hollywood</a>, the stages will likely only be applied to those grieving someone else's death.

</li><li> Much like the <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> example above, it can be said that the three main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> all represent some stage of grief and how they deal with it, since they've all been through a ridiculous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> for us to deduce this:
<ul><li> Guts is <strong>Anger</strong>, Denial, and Depression.
</li><li> Griffith is <strong>Depression</strong> and <strong>Bargaining</strong>.
</li><li> Casca is <strong>Denial</strong>.
</li><li> None of them have quite grappled with acceptance yet.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Barnaby</span> goes through stages 2 through 4 all at once at the prospect of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kotetsu's supposed death</span>. The former angrily yells at the latter, saying they weren't the kind of person to give up, crying hysterically and bargaining by claiming <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kotetsu</span> can't die yet because they haven't tried <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Barnaby's fried rice.</span>
</li><li> Saber of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> experiences four stages due to the collapse of her kingdom. At first she denied the kingdom was lost and fought to restore peace, only to be fatally injured. While dying she fell into depression over her failure and made a bargain with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alaya to become a Counter-Guardian in exchange for changing her decision to become king</span>. Shirou's resolve to accept what he has lost and continue living his life convinces Saber to accept her past and abandon the bargain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, this is sadly subverted just when you think this trope couldn't get more tragic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nicholas Wolfwood</span> goes through the stages in a mixed-up order while he is dying. He starts with Acceptance, then panics and goes into Bargaining ("No, I want to stay with them! There's so much I need to do!"), Depression (starts crying as he wonders if everything he did was a mistake), and dies trapped in Anger/Denial (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">"I did not want to die this way!"</a>).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/CLANNAD">CLANNAD</a></em>, Kotomi coming to terms with her parents' deaths was a rather mixed-up process which took several years: First, when her parents said they had to go on a business trip, she jumped straight into Anger, accusing them as liars for not wanting to come to her birthday party. Then she got a visit by a strange man who hinted that her parents died in a plane crash, leading her into Denial, shooing off the man and coming to believe that he was a "bad person" because he wanted something of her father's. She then went right into Bargaining, begging to God that she'll study hard, be a good girl and try to decipher what her parents were researching if He'll bring back her parents. But when she saw a report about the plane crash on television, she sunk into Depression, which led to her trying to burn the research paper the man was asking about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which was really a catalogue for teddy bears</span> and collapsing in tears as the burning paper set fire to the whole room. She eventually grows up having reached some level of Acceptance, making good of her Bargaining by studying diligently in and out of school, trying to "atone" for what she did that day. But she doesn't reach full Acceptance until the day that the strange man finally comes back, carrying her father's long lost briefcase - inside of which is the teddy bear her parents bought for her birthday.
</li><li> Tuka Luna Marceau suffers from this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate">Gate</a></em>. After a Fire Dragon attacks her village, her father throws her into a well. She ends up being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> to the attack, and continuously asks for extra food and clothing for someone who she's sure will show up.

After Nemo is captured by the diver, Marlin tells himself that he will find Nemo and goes out to find him, allowing himself to put up with Dory and the dangerous situations they get into together. When Marlin and Dory get stuck inside the mouth of a whale, Marlin gives up hope and sinks to the bottom, defeated (depression).

After 11-year-old Riley leaves all her friends and familiar surroundings and moves across the country, her Joy attempts to keep her cheerful, preventing her Sadness from dwelling on the old memories and tainting them (denial). In the process, the memories are rendered inaccessible, the parts of Riley's personality which are powered by them become nonfunctional, and Joy and Sadness become lost in Riley's mind. Without Sadness to provide appropriate responses to her new surroundings, Riley's Anger takes over. He plants the idea to run away to Minnesota, where she was happy (bargaining), and depression sets in and prevents the emotions from changing her course — except for Sadness, whose return reminds Riley that abandoning her family would make her feel worse. Viewing her previously Joyful memories through a Sad lens allows Riley to Accept her new circumstances.

This makes Ariel lose whatever respect she has for him and run away, leaving Triton utterly remorseful of his behavior, to the point where he agrees to take her place as Ursula's prisoner (depression). Finally, once Prince Eric saves them both, he decides that Ariel deserves to be with him and turns her into a human permanently so they can be together, restoring his daughter's faith in him (acceptance).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Roy Batty</a> goes through them all:
<ul><li> Denial: Escaping in the hopes of getting more life.
</li><li> Anger: "Fiery the angels fell; deep thunder rolled around their shores; burning with the fires of Orc!"
</li><li> Bargaining: His attempt to extract a longer life span from his own creator.
</li><li> Depression: When he realises it's already too late for his comrades and howls with grief over Priss's body
</li><li> Acceptance: His famous dying speech expresses only regret that the things he knows will become lost forever.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllThatJazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllThatJazz">All That Jazz</a></em>. As Roy Scheider's character experiences the stages while recovering from a heart attack, he points out that it sounds like the name of a Jewish law firm: "Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Despair and Acceptance, how can I direct your call?"
<ul><li> This is also worked into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to Bob Fosse's previous film <em>Lenny</em>, as Scheider (like Fosse) is the director of a movie about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LennyBruce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LennyBruce">Lenny Bruce</a>-like comic who acts out the five stages.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRundown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRundown">The Rundown</a></em>, Beck (The Rock) mentions something similar to the five stages.
<div class="indent"><strong>Beck</strong>: You're just like every other jackass that I've taken down. First they try to run, then they try to fight, then they try to negotiate. And when that doesn't work, you're gonna do what all the others do when they realize it's over. <br/><strong>Travis</strong>: Oh, yeah? What's that? <br/><strong>Beck</strong>: You're gonna get down on your hands and knees and you're gonna beg me for a break.
</div></li><li> Going blind, Shinnojo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveAndHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveAndHonor">Love and Honor</a></em> goes through Denial, then Anger and Despair at once and then manages Acceptance. He leaves out Bargaining though, perhaps it's below a Samurai to chaffer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em> has the main character going through precisely these stages as he learns how to deal with the eponymous day. First he can't believe it (denial), then he does all sorts of anti-social things like over-eating, robbing the armored car, sleeping with all of the attractive women in town, etc (anger), then he tries to figure out what he can do (bargaining), then he just gives up and falls back into bed and/or tries to kill himself (despair), until finally he accepts the situation and becomes a better person.
</li><li> Referenced (as "seven stages of grief") in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LookBothWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LookBothWays">Look Both Ways</a></em> by Meryl, who asks Nick, "What's the point in knowing where you're up to if you've still got to go through it anyway?"
</li><li> Applies to Jeff's character development in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardCandy">Hard Candy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Denial: After he's drugged and tied in the chair, most of what he says is pure denial. He makes excuses and comes up with reasons for his behavior, all lies, like why he didn't talk to the women in the chat room as soon as he found out they were older than Hayley. He says, "I'm a decent guy, ask anyone." Can't get much more textbook than that when it comes to denial.
</li><li> Anger: We see flashes of this throughout, but very soon after the line quoted above, Hayley starts really tearing into him and his anger rises to the surface. Cut to scene in bedroom, and we see, while he is still trying to convince her that she's wrong, his anger is barely contained now, his denials are not calm and reasonable any longer, but screamed at her. From that point on, anger tinges everything. Hayley even mocks him, saying, "A little angry, are we?"
</li><li> Bargaining: This one should be obvious. He's tied to a table. She tells him she's going to castrate him. He begs. He pleads. He promises he'll turn himself in, he'll do anything she wants. Actually, even before he knows what she's planning, he tells her to call the cops, he'll go to jail.
</li><li> Depression: This is a tough one, because it's hard to keep the action moving, but while Hayley is "castrating" Jeff, he lies there, dormant, silent. The fight has gone out of him. When she asks him if he wants some souvenirs, holding his "testicles" in front of him, he doesn't respond. He cries. But, life goes on and he's not down for the count. Denial and anger return, especially anger.
</li><li> Acceptance: "You're right. You're right, Hayley. Thank you. Thank you. This is me. This is who I am. Thank you. Thank you for helping me see it."
</li></ul></li><li> After Loki in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em> learns about his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">true origin</a>, he cycles through the stages:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor">Thor</a></em>: He starts with Denial, clinging to the hope that he is not different, just cursed. When Odin confirms his worst fear, he reacts with Anger, shouting at his adoptive father in the vault. He then tries to Bargain, believing that if he'll be a "good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Asgardian</a>" (by wiping out their enemies, that is, his own race), he can be recognized as such. When Thor uncovers his scheme, he resorts to Anger again during their fight. Finally, when Odin disapproves of his actions, he <em>literally</em> plummets into Depression by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">diving into a wormhole</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>: During an argument with Thor on the mountain ledge, he recalls his past with Anger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">Thor: The Dark World</a></em>: He is back at Denial when he brings up his "birthright" during his trail, of which he has none, and in a deleted scene when he fantasizes about being crowned king of Asgard while locked in the dungeons. Reminded of grim reality, he undeservedly takes his Anger out on Frigga.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em>: After four years of peace and quiet, he has nearly reached Acceptance. He rationalizes his backstory by writing a play and shares it with all of Asgard, jokes about being adopted and steps back as soon as Thor shows up without further claims to the throne.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em>: He has fully Accepted who he is:

<ul><li> Denial: Natasha Romanov <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">still believes she can go back to her former role of savior of the world and still hopes for a way to undo the Snap.</span>
</li><li> Anger: Clint Barton <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is going on a murder spree across the world to rid it of the people he thinks should have died in the Snap instead of his family, and admittedly has lost all hope.</span>
</li><li> Bargaining: Bruce Banner <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is trying his best to find other ways to stay happy, like mastering his Hulk form or gaining a large fanbase for his heroic deeds. Like pretty much every other former Avengers, he still jumps at the opportunity to undo the Snap.</span>
</li><li> Depression: Thor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has stopped being a hero and spends his days drinking beer, playing video games, and eating way too much. As a result, he is very out of shape and emotionally vulnerable, as seen when he reunites with his mother and starts crying like a little boy.</span>
</li><li> Acceptance: Tony Stark <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has moved on from the Avengers after Thanos' Snap, and now has a daughter and lives happily with her and his wife. He is the only member of the team who (at first) refuses to take part in the plan of going back in time to take the Stones and undo the Snap, in part because he fears it will undo his daughter's existence.</span>
</li><li> Steve, however, acts as the grief counselor, trying to help the group get out of their funk, sending Natasha to Clint and so on. Nothing for nothing, the first thing we see him doing post-time skip is leading a literal Group Therapy Session.

Both are at the denial-anger stage:
<ul><li> "Second Chance," when Mike informs her that Sandy had died. Carol thinks this is a cruel, sick joke (as Mike had made some very cruel jokes about Sandy previously), but as Mike presses on, it is clear that what she said wasn't happening just did. She even cries out about Sandy appearing to be fine and that he would recover.
</li><li> "Teach Me," where Carol is set up on a date (by her grandparents)... only for her to behave in a way that makes it clear that she is still deeply grieving Sandy. Jason and Maggie even remark that they thought Carol had gotten past the first stages but it was clear to them they were wrong.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>: Carly goes through the five stages in "iChristmas" when she is concerned about Spencer making a magnetic Christmas tree instead of getting a real one, which she initially will not accept. When the tree somehow catches fire and burns all her presents, she angrily wishes Spencer were normal. A Christmas angel named Mitch appears and grants her wish, and she sees what her life would be like if Spencer didn't drop out of law school and became a straight-faced lawyer instead of the goofy artist we know, as well as multiple key changes to her life (Sam is in jail, Freddie dates a mean girl while Nevel ends up as Carly's boyfriend, the webshow didn't exist, etc.). Having seen how horrible her life would be if this happened, she breaks down and wants her old life back. The wish is undone, the present goes back to the way it was, and she happily accepts Spencer for who he truly is.

Worth noting that this one doesn't show a perfect progression: he starts with Denial (in this case, not denying that it <em>happened</em>, but rather that he's <em>affected</em> by it, as he tries to insist he's already come to terms with the loss), then Anger, then he goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> for about twenty minutes until the last scene, where he's shown reaching Acceptance. It's not clear exactly what he went through emotionally during the second half of the episode, but it's reasonable to think that it might have been a more imperfect, realistic iteration.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> episode "Collateral Damage" gives a villainous example. When a city official is caught trading child pornography he initially assumes that the cops would back down because of his position (denial). In the interrogation room he starts accusing everyone of being part of a conspiracy to bring him down (anger). Then he tries to avoid prison by making a deal with the prosecutor (bargaining) but he has nothing to offer. He attempts suicide (depression). Then finally pleads guilty and takes his prison sentence (acceptance).

Specifically, the gang offering the gods a dangerous, painful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a> sacrifice in exchange for Buffy's life.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in "Intervention" when the Scoobies believe Buffy is dealing with her grief over her mother's death by boinking evil vampire Spike; actually Spike is screwing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexBot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexBot">Sex Bot</a> that he has had built to resemble Buffy.
<div class="indent"><strong>Anya</strong>: We're kind of thrown by the you having sex with Spike. <br/><strong>Buffy</strong>: The ... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotExpoWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotExpoWhat">who whating how with huh</a>? <br/><strong>Anya</strong>: Okay, that's denial. That usually comes before anger. <br/><strong>Buffy</strong>: <em>I am not having sex with Spike!</em> <br/><strong>Anya</strong>: Anger.
</div></li><li> Then there is Willow at the end of season six, swapping the list somewhat through the last Three episodes:
<ul><li> Denial: Willow desperately pleading to Tara to Wake up, moaning "no, no" all the time.
</li><li> Anger: Willow shifts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">Red Eyes, Take Warning</a>, before summoning Osiris.
</li><li> Bargaining: With <em>Osiris</em> himself. After that, she reverts to anger for the rest of the season, but that could easily be fueled by
</li><li> Depression, because even Giles and the coven in England notes the sudden fury born of her sorrow - she reacts by turning stone cold. Depression (or rather <em>despair</em>, which also chimes in on Willow´s reaction here), is actually sided with wrath/anger in one of the upper circles of Hell inn <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em>.
</li><li> Acceptance: When she finally breaks down in Xander`s arms.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a fan theory that the overall arc of Buffy's characterisation through the whole series is based on the Kubler-Ross stages:
<ul><li> Season One: Denial
</li><li> Season Two: Anger
</li><li> Seasons Three and Four: Bargaining
</li><li> Seasons Five, Six, and Seven: Depression
</li><li> The final episode: Acceptance

A lot. And in this case, it's just four stages (he skips the bargaining part).
</li><li> An interesting twist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a></em>, in which a season 3 episode features suicide pills, which stages are depression, loss of temper, forgetfulness and happiness, in that order. Oh, and before you die you jump in a corner.
<ul><li> In the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackadderGoesForth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackadderGoesForth">Blackadder Goes Forth</a></em>, Edmund goes through several of these stages, including denial (trying to get out of the big push by pretending to be mad), bargaining (asking Field Marshall Haig to get him out by reminding him that he saved Haig's life in an earlier campaign), anger (if his reaction to Baldricks's poetry is anything to go by), and finally acceptance when he tells his men "good luck, everyone" and decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity">Face Death with Dignity</a>.

Red says that he's got two stages: anger and drinking.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> goes through all five stages as the group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">realizes that they failed biology</a>, even though a recurring character died at the same time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFunInFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFunInFuneral">Anger occurs during the man's funeral.</a> Also in that episode, Psych major Britta mentioned denial as the first stage of grief.

</li><li> Agron can be seen doing this, though in a different order, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusBloodAndSand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusBloodAndSand">Spartacus: Blood and Sand</a></em> and its sequels.

Towards the end of the show he is crucified, and then enters Denial over the state of his injuries. He falls into Depression when he realizes he can't fight, and then does Bargaining when he finds a way to fight anyway. And then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after they lose the war, and Spartacus dies, he reaches acceptance, when he leaves behind his weapons and leads the survivors to safety and freedom.</span>
</li><li> Being a show about a support group for people who have experienced loss, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoOn">Go On</a></em> has a lot of this. Ryan seems stuck in Stage One, but often goes through the other stages to further the episode's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a>, and some members of the group represent different stages (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirSwearsALot">Anne represents anger</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Danny represents denial</a>, etc.)
</li><li> A rare case of it happening without attention being drawn to it happened in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "The Loss." Troi loses her ability to sense emotions and shortly goes through every stage, only skipping over bargaining. She at first shrugs it off and says the ability will simply come back (denial), then begins to lash out at Dr. Crusher for not finding a cure (anger), breaks down crying in her quarters (depression), then after some words from Riker and Guinan, returns to her work and helps save the day (acceptance). The portrayal is more subtle in that she doesn't suddenly snap from one stage to the other and can be seen sliding between them (while still in denial, she snaps at Riker for being sympathetic before exploding at Beverly; while still angry over the situation, she begins cutting off ties with her friends because she's becoming too depressed to keep going).
</li><li> On the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewGirl">New Girl</a></em> episode "Goldmine", Schmidt goes through the five stages after learning that Cece is thinking of having breast reduction surgery.

Whether or not he ever makes it to acceptance is debatable.
<ul><li> Diggle by contrast spends most of the episode firmly locked in <em>anger</em>.

She quickly enters denial, then anger when she lashes out at Rip (correctly) deducing that he knew this would happen but did not tell anyone. She breaks down crying later (Depression), and looks for a way to resurrect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laurel</span> (Bargaining), despite being told her death is a "Fixed Point in time" and apparently "has" to happen. She doesn't reach Acceptance until the finale of Season 2, where she chooses not to resurrect her. In fact, from that point on <em>no one</em> ever even suggests doing so (despite multiple opportunities presenting themselves), suggesting they are all in a rather extreme form of Acceptance.

Mirrors is infamous for its refusal to accept hard choices and no-win scenarios and its Queen constantly ignores the failures of her past Princesses in telling each that they are the True Heir and prophesied to bring back the Kingdoms. Storms exists in a state of perpetual fury against the Darkness, caring only about burning it out of existence no matter the cost. Tears exists on the border between Bargaining and Depression: its Queen is rumored to have made a bargain with the Darkness to keep her city shielded at the cost of a constant stream of stolen Wisps, and one of her key traits is that she has lost hope of any better solution than the one she used. And the five Radiant Courts can be said to collectively represent Acceptance: they acknowledge their failures and losses and are resolved to do better, to rebuild what was lost and restore Light to the world.

<ul><li> Gluck's opera <em>Orfeo ed Euridice</em> is essentially a study of the five stages of grief composed centuries before Kübler-Ross. At the beginning, Orpheus is in denial, continuously calling for the dead Eurydice and begging her to come back to him. Then he switches to anger at the gods, resolving to defy them by journeying to the underworld and bringing Eurydice back. His whole journey through the underworld embodies bargaining, as he literally bargains with the gods, furies and spirits, and as he struggles to keep his end of the bargain by not looking back at Eurydice. When he does look back and loses her again, he succumbs to depression. He never quite reaches acceptance, because the opera <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAlternateEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAlternateEnding">changes the ending of the myth</a> and has the gods restore Eurydice to him anyway... though some creative modern productions have had her stay dead and turned the "happy" ending into a symbol of acceptance, with Orpheus realizing his wife will always live on in his memory.

After he dies, she turns in rage on the two gangs (anger) and threatens to kill them all and then herself, as if their deaths would compensate for Tony's and resolve the tragedy of their hate (bargaining). But she can't bring herself to do it and collapses in tears (depression). But in the end, as the gangs make their peace and join together to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">carry Tony's body in a procession</a>, she follows them in bittersweet pride and triumph that she created this glimmer of hope (acceptance).

First she's in denial and insists it's an illusion; then she's angry at everyone who tries to comfort her; and then she trails off in sadness.

In the last minute, she realized that this isn't the way and she has to commit on rescuing him.
</li><li> Bargaining: In the middle to the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift">BlazBlue: Continuum Shift</a></em>, Litchi found out that she contracted a similar corruption like Arakune and her time draws near that she would succumb to the same corruption. However, an unsavory chance was presented to her by someone she's very suspicious at: Hazama of NOL. If she joins his division in NOL, she can get more information to save Arakune and herself. Even if she didn't like it in general, rather than burdening her other friends with her grief, she decided to take the chance and go rogue, joining the obvious bad guys.
</li><li> Anger: Hazama proves to be <em>really</em> nasty and Litchi's time to work in NOL <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil">was not enjoyable</a>, but she still bore through them all throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronophantasma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronophantasma">BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma</a></em>. However, when the good guys turn out to be largely unsympathetic at her, calling her stupid or even warranting arrest on her, Litchi at times tends to snap at her former friends. But she continued on the side of evil, which pits her against the other friends that didn't blame her, from her tone, she looks like she's angry at herself...

<ul><li> Lightning is Anger, deciding if it's her fate to destroy Cocoon, then fine, that's exactly what she'll do and woe to anyone who tries to stop her. Hope also gets Anger, directed at Snow, who he blames for his mother's death and resolves to kill in revenge.
</li><li> Snow is Bargaining, believing that as long as he tries hard enough, there must be a way to set everything right. There's a dash of Denial as well, as if there isn't a way, he's got a lot of guilt to own up to and he knows it.
</li><li> Sazh is Acceptance, deciding to turn himself in and be executed because he's tired of running and just wants to see his son again before he dies.
</li><li> Vanille is Denial, saying outright she acts happy, cheerful and excited to cover up her deep guilt over inadvertently being the cause of a lot of the story's conflicts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gris">GRIS</a></em> revolves around this trope.

</li><li> Anger: After her father revealed he knew of Joshua's past and that he might leave one day, Estelle angrily yells at him and runs off.

<ul><li> Clock Town represents Denial. The moon is about to fall and kill everyone, but the citizens couldn't care less. The head carpenter in particular laughs at the idea of the moon actually falling, and tells the mayor that the carnival should go on as planned.
</li><li> Woodfall has Anger. The Deku princess has disappeared, and her father finds a scapegoat he can kill to calm his frustration.
</li><li> Snowhead has Bargaining. Darmani, the leader of the Goron, has died, and his people are going to die as well if the eternal winter doesn't end. He asks Link to prolong his life a little bit more with his magic, just enough to allow him to save his tribe.
</li><li> Great Bay represents Depression. Lulu's children have been stolen by pirates, and all she does to deal with it is stand by the sea in silence.
</li><li> Acceptance is found in Ikana. Link climbs towards the sky through the Stone Tower and reaches enlightenment, represented by the Light Arrows.
</li></ul></li><li> The four stages of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">rampancy</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> series (Melancholia, Anger, Jealousy, Metastability) bear a strong resemblance to this. <em>Marathon: RED</em>'s three chapters are titled "Resistance", "Desperation", and "Acceptance".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em>: Before Naked Snake confronts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">The Boss</a>, he faces the Cobra Unit. Each member of the unit "carries an emotion into battle", which each somewhat align with a stage of grief.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a>, After Flint is told that his wife Hinawa was killed by a Drago, he immediately enters Anger, when he attacks some of the villagers around him and has to be to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead">Tapped On The Head</a> by Lighter. After he gets over it, he then enters Bargaining for the rest of the game, after his son Claus goes missing trying to avenge Hinawa's death, and he subsequently leaves Lucas alone for years, desperate to not lose his oldest son too.
</li><li> Yukari Takeba in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a>: The Answer</em> surprisingly follows through these stages, which explains her more aggressive attitude throughout the game:
<ul><li> Denial: Ever since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the death of the main character</span>, Yukari left the dorm alone and attended cram school in order to forget that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main character died</span>. However, it fails to do anything to her as she's eventually called back to deal with the Abyss of Time. And then...
</li><li> Anger: Finding out that Aigis inherited the Wild Card, not her, infuriated Yukari further that she started acting hostile and cold towards Aigis.
</li><li> Bargaining: Later, Yukari found out that there was a way to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reunite with the main character</span> by using the key to go back in time before fighting Nyx and fight it out again. Driven by her love and grief, Yukari decided to take the chance, against everyone else's suggestion (Excepting Mitsuru), and wanted to use the key to go back in time. This causes a friction in the SEES and they end up 'fighting to the death'.
</li><li> Depression: Yukari lost, but was restored by Aigis. Still in frustration, Yukari wrestled the key from Aigis... and failed again. In anguish, Yukari finally revealed that she's still unable to get over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the death of the main character</span> and has lost hope, only driven with the prospect of reuniting with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">him</span> again. It was at this point that Mitsuru comforted her and promised that she'll stay with her through hard and good times, enabling Yukari to cry out all her griefs.
</li><li> Acceptance: After fighting Erebus and realizing the importance of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main character's death and sacrifice</span>, Yukari finally accepted that she has to move on and do her part in making humans happy for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his</span> sake. She's no longer hostile to Aigis and resumes being the good ol' Yukari Takeba. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena">Persona 4: Arena</a></em>, Yukari has even become the actress of the Neo Featherman's Pink Argus, making children who watch her happy.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RandalsMonday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RandalsMonday">Randal's Monday</a></em>, Sally starts to go through them as Matt dies over and over again in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>, each day in a different way. On the first day, Sally can't accept the fact that Matt is dead. On the second day, she gets mad at Randal because she thinks he's responsible for Matt's suicide. On the third day, Sally ponders ways in which she could bring Matt back to life. Unusually for this trope, however, this trend stops suddenly and no more stages are shown in play for the rest of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rime">RiME</a></em>: The entire game is built upon this concept, as the game areas are explicitly named after the five stages and thematically linked to them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This makes perfect sense, as the ending shows that the story is a tale the father spins in his head as a way of coping with his son's death.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://solacegame.com/">Solace<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is a short freeware <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp">Shoot 'em Up</a> with five stages. Each stage corresponds to a stage of grief and attempts to reflect that stage in the gameplay.
</li><li> We see these stages in the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine">Spec Ops: The Line</a></em>, when Captain Walker is confronted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Colonel Konrad</a> (or more specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hallucinates a conversation with Konrad after discovering that the Colonel has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">Dead All Along</a></span>). After delivering some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truths</a> amid a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>, Konrad aims a gun at Walker and prepares to shoot.
<div class="indent"><strong>Konrad</strong>: I'm going to count to five, then I'm pulling the trigger. <br/><strong>Walker</strong>: (<em>fearful</em>) You're not real. This is all in my head. <br/><strong>Konrad</strong>: Are you sure? Maybe it's in mine! <em>One.</em> <br/><strong>Walker</strong>: (<em>angry</em>) No. Everything, all this, it was <em>your</em> fault! <br/><strong>Konrad</strong>: If that's what you believe then shoot me! <em>Two.</em> <br/><strong>Walker</strong>: (<em>tearfully</em>) I-I didn't mean to hurt anybody... <br/><strong>Konrad</strong>: No-one ever does, Walker. <em>Three...</em>
</div><ul><li> Depending on the player's choices, Walker can resign himself to Konrad's judgment and die, or shoot first, surviving the ordeal as an utterly broken man. Which ending is "Depression" and which is "Acceptance" is probably open to argument. Or you can have Walker wipe out the friendly soldiers sent to extract him, adding a "Kill Everything" option to the Stages of Grief.

After 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter' (Denial), which would come next in the line?" The possible answers were:

<ul><li> He spent 42/33 years in <strong>denial</strong> about it as revealed in "The Man". In the same episode, his mother, Granny Jojo, is revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecemberDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecemberDecemberRomance">dating again</a>, prompting him to take most of his <strong>anger</strong> out on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentWithNewParamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentWithNewParamour">her new spouse</a>, Louie.
</li><li> Despite accepting Louie as a surrogate father, he refuses to let him marry his mother, setting up the <strong>bargaining</strong> stage in "The Signature", where Frankie returns to settle the issue but ends up stealing his son's home. After having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> over leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">his precious child</a>, he changes his mind and gives back the house. In return, Richard welcomes him back into his life, still in the bargaining stage, but ends up unintentionally making their rekindled relationship worse throughout "The Outside".
</li><li> Finally, in "The Father", Frankie has an attack of guilt from The Vermin Man ceremony and excludes himself from the Wattersons out of remorse, causing Richard to go into <strong>depression</strong> from losing his father again. His kids try to cheer him up by having him and Frankie bond to make up for lost time, which only makes Richard lose his patience with his father's old habits and give up on him.
</li><li> However, Frankie makes it clear that he still loves his son no matter what and didn't want him to make the same mistakes he did, prompting Richard to finally <strong>accept</strong> that Frankie's abandonment made him a better parent and truly reconciles with him.
