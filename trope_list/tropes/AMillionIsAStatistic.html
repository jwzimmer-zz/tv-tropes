</p><p>In other words, when some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy">tragedy</a> befalls a character such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> (or even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">villain</a>), the audience is expected to sympathize with him or perhaps even cry for him. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Redshirt Army</a> can be sacrificed with reckless abandon, and no one will so much as bat an eyelash. The death of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessValue">single plot-important character</a> is a tragic and often pivotal point; the deaths of thousands of faceless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, even if by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">torture</a>, are simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">background noise</a>, so to speak.

</p><p>Compare and contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">Protagonist-Centered Morality</a>, which has morality centered not on character exposure but relation to the protagonist, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance">Nominal Importance</a>, where lack of exposure also makes a character expendable, but without the connotations of massive scale.

</p><p>While the origin of this quotation and its innumerable variants have been ascribed to Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Kevin Federline, and many others, the original version actually comes from the 1938 book <em>Thoughts of a Biologist</em>, by experimental biologist Jean Rostand:

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>: Miroku and Sango are so used to the mass destruction of their era that, while they're sympathetic to the loss of entire villages, they're also pragmatic about not being able to do much about it. Inuyasha is also a half-demon who is generally not too sympathetic to most humans. Kagome, however, subverts this trope. As a modern girl thrust back in time, she generally reacts more strongly than the others and once was absolutely horrified at Inuyasha stopping for a meal break in the middle of a corpse-strewn battlefield. That said, even Kagome is more likely to react to the plight of someone she's personally attached to than the loss of strangers. It's how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Kouga</a> became a friend of the group - despite being responsible for the destruction (and eating) of at least three villages that the group knows about, they ended up forgiving him and becoming friends with him. Notably, however, they were never allowed to find out that Kouga had destroyed Rin's village and killed Rin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nobody ever comments zilch about seeing entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Redshirt Armies</a> being blown apart. But when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kamina</span> dies, the whole cast spends <em>three full chapters</em> mourning his death.
</li><li> Even more so in the movie. You can just feel the anguish that everyone on Dai-Gurren Dan feels when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kittan made the sacrifice</span>, as well as the resulting roaring rampage of revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> Light Yagami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. Certainly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">L's death</span> evokes a stronger reaction from the audience than the thousands of others killed before (and the even greater number killed after). This is somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a>, however, in that the majority of the people he killed were not just faceless masses but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">criminals</a> killed for the sake of Light's ambition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">make the world a better place</a>, while the named characters he takes out are done for the sake of saving his own ass.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted — explicitly run away from — in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove">Macross: Do You Remember Love?</a></em>. In the former, characters at times explicitly comment and agonize over the fact that there are civilian casualties — in one later episode, the heroes stop their pursuit of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">villain</a> because he's just set a city on fire. In <em>Do You Remember Love?</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hikaru finally convinces Minmay to sing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitledAfterTheSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitledAfterTheSong">Title Song</a> to halt the Zentradi assault in its tracks by forcefully reminding her about the millions who'd died during the war, including mentioning some names of Hikaru's friends and squadmates that (at least in the movie continuity) she'd likely never met. Suitably chastened, she realizes it is her human duty to sing and stop the war. He never brings up the possibility of him and her being killed, instead focusing on everyone else and the lives they sacrificed</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus">Macross Plus</a></em>, Isamu and Guld's final showdown takes them to the streets of Macross City. They punch, shoot, and launch missiles at each other with little concern for the buildings and roads they're demolishing in the planet's most populated city —made even worse when you remember that Macross City is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">under Sharon Apple's thrall</span>, so the civilians can't even notice the destruction around them or try to flee.
</li><li> Another aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>: every Vajra attack has heavy tolls on the population, and the narrative devotes some time to this. It goes particularly far in the aftermath of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vajra invasion of Island One, where one of the main protagonists and the civilian president are killed, and the next episode focuses on a fleet-wide memorial service for <em>everyone</em> who died in the massacre rather than focus on those two characters</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Often overlooked (since it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">happens before the show</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, Zeon kills the majority of people living in space in the beginning stages of the war. This was once calculated as being the second-highest body count of any faction in the franchise's history (only the mass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a> that preceded <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em>, killing over 99% of the population, outdid it). Strangely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">this hasn't hurt Zeon's popularity any</a>.
<ul><li> Weirdly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a>'s</em> Titans have a much worse reputation than Zeon even though they only gassed <em>one</em> colony (Zeon did this to several, <em>at least</em>, and then <em>dropped them on the Earth</em>) and were in general only slightly more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>-ish than Zeon was. To be fair, when Zeon was doing it, there wasn't yet a treaty forbidding this very behavior. The Titans did it in response to <em>peaceful protests</em> in a part of the colony. Also, the Federation was also doing <em>something</em> in response to Zeon as well, since both sides lost half their population during the first week. And some level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPeopleRebelAgainstAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPeopleRebelAgainstAuthority">Cool People Rebel Against Authority</a> is also likely involved, since Zeon were rebelling against the Federation which the Titans worked for.
</li><li> Harshly averted in the miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0080WarInThePocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0080WarInThePocket">Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket</a></em>. Not only are you able to witness the carnage close up from a bystander's point of view, you also meet most of the mooks fighting in the story's conflict. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While a lot of the main characters are part of a special-forces team, in the end they're still just a bunch of mooks - all of whom die, either in a shootout against overwhelming odds or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">curbstomped</a> by the Gundam, no matter how much the viewer expects any of them to pull out an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> and destroy the Gundam. To top it off, the anime made a very specific point of making their deaths utterly pointless, even if the last remaining member of the team succeeds in his immediate goal - the destruction of the Gundam - at the cost of his own life.</span>
</li><li> In general though, the Universal Century averts this by often pointing out that every soldier is human in and of themselves, have emotions, dreams and an identity of their own, and that every soldier that dies is another life lost pointlessly in war (in fact, in <em>Zeta Gundam</em>, when protagonist Kamille Bidan gets angry at resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> Yazan Gable, he is quite obviously angry that Yazan treats war like a game and that people on all sides are dying not just on his side).

Treize astonishes him by <em>giving an exact number</em> ("As of yesterday, 99,822 people"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadHaveNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadHaveNames">listing several names from memory</a>, and calling Lady Une to ask how many have died so far in the current battle and to request that those names be forwarded to him so he can memorize them. Whatever else may be said about him, Treize does not take sacrifice lightly, not even that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> averts this. Nagi spends a good chunk of his time after the war saving refugees, and Arika went to great lengths to save as many civilians as she possibly could. Negi holds to the same philosophy; the main reason that he doesn't join <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kurt Godel</span> is because he doesn't believe in this trope, and if joining forces means that they can't save <em>everyone</em>, then to hell with an alliance.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, when it is shown that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Van Hohenheim actually took the time to come to an understanding with EACH and EVERY ONE of the 500,000+ souls now trapped in his body as a result of Father's destruction of Xerxes</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em> suffers horrendously from this, coupled with having millions of people killed in <em>virtually every battle</em>.
<ul><li> However, it's never taken lightly. Most officers strive to minimize loss of life, and at least on the Alliance's side it's one of the sources of the country's problems that so much of its youth dies on the battlefields, with almost no veterans to speak of.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight, averted, discussed, deconstructed, and used as a major source of drama in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, particularly the manga. Tens of thousands of people die as collateral damage from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> battles <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and tens of billions as enemy casualties</span>, and every character has their own take on it. Some pilots ignore civilian casualties and only pay attention to their own plight, some stall the battle and risk losing to give civilians time to evacuate, some get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSODs</a>... it goes on. Especially heartbreaking in the last battle in the manga: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a main character has to murder the population of a planet in order to win. He insists on killing each person individually, to make it as painless as possible, but that doesn't make it any easier for him</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> does this occasionally. The most prominent example would be when Rolo tries to remember how many people he's killed. He isn't able to remember exactly how many and then uses the analogy of someone trying to remember how many times they've brushed their teeth in their lives; you've done it so many times that you're past caring. This moment is made even more scary when you realise that, to Rolo, killing someone has as much emotional impact as cleaning your teeth.
<ul><li> Lelouch plays it straight AND subverts it at times.
<ul><li> During the battle of Narita, Lelouch and Kallen destroy a small town and kill everybody in it. They only think about how many enemy soldiers they just killed. Only when they find out the father of a classmate was also killed, they feel remorse about it. C.C. calls him out on this, asking if he thought this was somehow a unique instance, and pointing out that pretty much all of the soldiers they killed also had loved ones who are now grieving for their loss.
</li><li> At the end of R1, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lelouch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">loses control of his power</a> and causes Euphemia to go on a massacre, resulting in the deaths of thousands of innocent Japanese who believed in her; Lelouch, as Zero, is begged by these dying people to save them, but is also struck by the need to stop the destruction</span>. It shows Lelouch's panic over doing a horrible, monstrous thing, versus allowing an even more horrible, monstrous thing - the question of being selfish or sacrificing your own sense of self for the greater good, averting the trope completely.
</li><li> Three quarters through R2, however, it plays it straight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Millions of people die, but all Lelouch (and most fans) can think about is Nunnally.</span> Everyone else averts it, though, with the respect of many of his upper-level subordinates losing trust in him by thinking that he doesn't care - when in fact Lelouch's worst nightmares have come to life to haunt him.

They get significantly less of a follow-up than many other deaths, notably Enchu's mother, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Panza</span> (whose death weighs heavily on Roji) and Kid. Even Fujiwara, a minor character who was one of Imai's subordinates before he got killed in the Arcanum, comes back as a haunt and is mentioned as an example of someone who was incompetent but determined.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em>, the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Erstin</span> seems to weigh more heavily on Nina's conscience and Arika's mind than that of the many other people who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust">most likely killed</a> (although no casualty total is given) by Nina using the Harmonium to destroy entire cities.

Although Kenshin was an assassin and thus knew the name and face of his main targets, he killed all who were accompanying said target at the time, many of whom remain nameless. Part of the series of events that led him to making that vow involved him learning that the woman he had married during the war (and then accidentally killed when she got between him and an opponent in a fight) had been engaged to one of those mooks.

Aside from things involving the main characters, and the establishment of a survivor school meant to counsel and help those who made it out, the series ignores the massive controversy and consequences that would occur from such an event, though the resident government agent all but outright states <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">it's because of the Japanese government taking a direct hand in handling the press that's keeping the survivors from being hounded day in and out</a>. In fact, not only did virtual reality games become more popular after the SAO incident but they feature a far heavier emphasis on killing (albeit due to the fact the technology that caused the players to be trapped and killed in the first place was replaced with tech that <em>couldn't</em> do that). Even so, this becomes incredibly egregious for some when the main character compares the person responsible for said deadly MMO to a villain he was fighting, responsible for merely trapping and brainwashing, not killing, a tenth of that amount, with the end result is the former being somehow the <em>lesser</em> of the two evils, with the justification that the first guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">wasn't being such a complete and unrepentant asshole about the whole thing like the current one</a>.

Turns out, that was the memory of the Sentinel's actions in Genosha. Being an intelligent, feeling being now, it is immediately gripped by intense guilt and withdraws its attack. Kitty explains that the murders of sixteen million people is too large for the human mind to fully comprehend, but the computer mind of the Sentinel is capable of appraising each one individually.

He challenges her claims of being an honorable fighter by mentioning the long lifespan of the Shokkan and asking how many deaths such a warrior who has lived so long must is <em>personally</em> responsible for if such battles to the death are commonplace among them. He suggests Sheeva must have killed <em>thousands</em> (even one victim every two months would do so) also mentioning how many families she must have torn apart, even suggesting that some of her opponents may have been children of previous ones, seeking revenge.

However, all these deaths are not taken lightly by the story and this trope is discussed by the characters themselves: Dipper admits it was just easy to throw a party and celebrate when everyone he knew personally survived the disaster, and the weight of it didn't really set in for him until he spent time digging through the wreckage of the town, while Mabel is instantly crushed by guilt when confronted with the fact that people died and has to actively push the dead out of her mind to stay functional.

<ul><li> Though Gaunt himself averts this rather pointedly; he takes time to memorize the names, faces and details of every man he's fought with or who's died under his command, and can recite them from memory. He gets quite visibly upset when it turns out there's someone he has forgotten.

<ul><li> Presumably, the later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> to make that Guardsman be a Space Marine and then later again be an Adeptus Custodes was to emphasize how much of the ridiculous power of Chaos Horus was given - meaning the reason for the Emperor's realization wasn't exactly because of how he killed someone in front of him without lifting a finger, it was because he killed someone of superhuman strength without lifting a finger.
</li><li> The reason for the Emperor's realization is still stated to be him realizing that Horus was irredeemably evil. Before that point he had been hoping he could reason with Horus and make peace, but seeing him personally kill another human being, who had no way off injuring him, without a thought made the Emperor understand that Horus couldn't be reasoned with. This is also the reason why most fans like the "Guardsman"-version better.

With individual stories, the statistics become people  but even that is a lie, for the people continue to suffer in numbers that themselves are numbing and meaningless. Look, see the child's swollen, swollen belly, and the flies that crawl at the corners of his eyes, his skeletal limbs: will it make it easier for you to know his name, his age, his dreams, his fears? To see him from the inside? And if it does, are we not doing a disservice to his sister, who lies in the searing dust beside him, a distorted, distended caricature of a human child? And there, if we feel for them, are they now more important to us than a thousand other children touched by the same famine, a thousand other young lives who will soon be food for the flies' own myriad squirming children?

Also, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">Legacy of the Force</a></em> series, someone actually called Luke on how many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhattheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhattheHellHero">ordinary people died when he blew up the Death Star.</a>
<ul><li> It came up in an earlier book - part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackFleetCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackFleetCrisis">Black Fleet Crisis</a></em> - where Luke was trying to befriend an extreme pacifist who claimed to have known his mother. A pacifist along the lines of "Violence is never, ever justified, in any circumstances!" Turns out he does know exactly how many people died, and most of the galaxy doesn't condemn him for it, since they were Imperials on the <em>Death Star</em> right after Alderaan, and although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar">a book of the same name</a> shows us that a lot of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">weren't exactly evil</a>, they weren't exactly innocent either - they were troops and support staff on a <em>giant battle station that had just destroyed a pacifistic planet</em>, after all. A lot of Imperials were uncomfortable about Alderaan - the official story started off saying that the Rebels had hijacked a mining tool, but absolutely no one believed that, so they put the blame on Grand Moff Tarkin going mad with power.
</li><li> Even prior to this, in <em>I, Jedi</em> Luke mentioned that he'd killed millions by blowing up the Death Star, and thus compared himself with Kyp. However, this is shot down by the person he's talking with, who notes that was very different, as the Death Star was a military installation and he had no other choice to save even more.
</li></ul></li><li> The roofer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Clerks</a></em> parodies this whole theory.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Dante</strong>: My friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Roofer</strong>: Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm a roofer... (digs into pocket and produces business card) Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements. And speaking as a roofer, I can say that a roofer's personal politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Randal</strong>: Like when?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Roofer</strong>: Three months ago I was offered a job up in the hills. A beautiful house with tons of property. It was a simple reshingling job, but I was told that if it was finished within a day, my price would be doubled. Then I realized whose house it was.

</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Roofer</strong>: Dominick Bambino's.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Randal</strong>: "Babyface" Bambino? The gangster?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Roofer</strong>: The same. The money was right, but the risk was too big. I knew who he was, and based on that, I passed the job on to a friend of mine.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Dante</strong>: Based on personal politics.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Roofer</strong>: Right. And that week, the Foresci family put a hit on Babyface's house. My friend was shot and killed. He wasn't even finished shingling.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Randal</strong>: No way! <br/><strong>Roofer</strong>: I'm alive because I knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client. My friend wasn't so lucky. You know, any contractor willing to work on that Death Star knew the risks. If they were killed, it was their own fault. A roofer listens to this... (taps his heart) not his wallet.
</div></li><li> The death tally after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">the Yuuzhan Vong war</a> was over 365 trillion. This is <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">unrealistic</a>, by the way: With all the inhabited worlds of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> universe (enough to have 20 million sentient species), we know that for a war where the entire galaxy was fighting would probably lead to those kinds of casualties if it was on both sides.
</li><li> The Clone Wars is another example, played straight. The clone army is fighting and dying every day for three years to protect the galaxy, when they have no choice but to fight (unless they're given greater autonomy in the case of being a specialist, such as an ARC Trooper or commando). Many of the people of the galaxy think nothing of them dying because they just see the clones as organic droids. Created to fight, then to be tossed away later. Karen Traviss's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepublicCommandoSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepublicCommandoSeries">Republic Commando Series</a></em> series delves deeply into inter-clone relations, showing us each different personalities, preferences, methods of speaking, and other such things. During a scene in one of the books, an ARC Trooper takes his helmet off in a crowded bus that he had gotten onto. A lot of the people aboard are very surprised that not only are the clones <em>human</em>, but they're also <em>young</em>, having only been grown around ten years ago.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted, even after being turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekDestiny">Star Trek: Destiny</a></em> trilogy. Hundreds of space stations are destroyed and at least a dozen planets depopulated, with a final death toll in the hundreds of billions. Pathos is established partly through the reactions of the Starfleet brass, Federation President, and various officers and politicians from other races; and partly by showcasing the final moments of various incidental characters (often relatives of main characters).
</li><li> Intentionally invoked for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">Culture-Idiran</a> War in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConsiderPhlebas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConsiderPhlebas">Consider Phlebas</a></em>. The epilogue quotes from a historical text which details the overall casualties, including over eight hundred <em>billion</em> lives, the destruction of over fifteen thousand planet-equivalent habitats, and six stars. The very next sentence notes that from a galactic perspective it was a minor bushfire war with low casualties and a small scope (".02 percent of the galaxy by volume and .01 percent of the stellar population.").
</li><li> The Dutch satirical writer Battus once derived a formula to determine the perceived psychological impact of an event in which people died: the logarithm of (# dead / (distance * years past)). Impact goes down with distance, as well as with time elapsed since the event. It goes up with the number of casualties, and all of this logarithmically, as 1000 versus 100 casualties give about the same increase in sense of impact as 100 versus 10. The formula, he notes, is correct also for the edge case that time = 0 and distance = 0, which is indisputably a most serious event for the individual concerned. The newspaper examples below are roughly similar, but as Battus is a mathematician in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, this one has a scientific basis.
</li><li> Used by name in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Doom">Doom</a></em>. At the end of the first book, the two main characters watch from space as the earth is carpet-nuked. They aren't nearly as disturbed by this as they feel they should be, until they start thinking about specific people they know who are probably dead.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BelisariusSeries">Belisarius Series</a>, soldiers die in frequently large quantities. Belisarius tries not to kill his men, but he knows that there will be casualties. And then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ally and friend Eon</span> dies, and he goes to pieces. Partly justified in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eon's death causes a succession crisis, because his son is an infant</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotzAndMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotzAndMeyer">Götz and Meyer</a></em> inverts this. The narrator claims that the titular Nazis could only have killed as many people as they did if they thought of each victim as a number rather than a person. A statistic equals a million (or five thousand, in their case.)

Wright</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfChaos">Fugitives of Chaos</a></em>, Victor weighs the death of everyone on shipboard (who had taken them up when they were lost at sea) vs. the death of everyone in the universe if they let themselves get killed. Colin just wants to help the ship. (Fortunately, Amelia decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>.)

Stirling</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emberverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emberverse">Emberverse</a>, most of Earth's population died following the Change, which rendered guns and most forms of power generation inoperable. Twenty-plus years later, most of those born since the Change take living in such a death-ridden world for granted; some of the young protagonists even ridicule most pre-Change humans for being so incompetent at survival skills. While exploring Toronto's CN Tower, however, they discover the skeletons of a woman (apparently a Change-time suicide) and her cat, and are deeply moved by the evidence of these particular deaths.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">the Mallorean</a></em>, Zakath starts out trying to commit genocide. His Mallorean soldiers kill every Murgo they can find, adults and children alike. While he may not have killed a million, it wasn't for lack of effort. Granted, he's quite crazy and everyone hates Murgos, but the protagonists forgive him quite easily. It's jarring when you consider the fact that these are the same people who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> entombed Zedar in solid rock for all eternity, because he killed Durnik in self-defense. The prequels attempt to justify this, mostly by having him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a>, but we don't see that in the Belgariad</span>.

As the archangel Uriel points out to him: "It's one thing to say 'Let the world burn.' It's something else entirely to say 'Let <em>Molly</em> burn.'"
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em> novels manage to avert this despite the fact they almost never kill off long-term characters (named characters, yes). To name one example, <em>Death or Glory</em> features an extended passage of Cain and Jurgen walking through the ruins of a town after an Ork WAAGH! came through, imagining civilians being gunned down for sport from past experience with the greenskins. The effect is quietly horrific.
</li><li> The page quote, and ultimately the title, comes from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackObelisk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackObelisk">The Black Obelisk</a>,</em> from Ludwig's musings after a WWI veteran is murdered for refusing to (illegally) fly the Imperial flag at a ceremony commemorating the dead of that war.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOverstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOverstory">The Overstory</a></em> discusses this trope in relation to people's apathy towards what is happening to the environment - the scale is just so immense, and people are far more focused on the lives and endeavors of a few human beings that they happen to know. One character, Neelay Mehta, tends to invert this trope, preferring science fiction books as a child precisely because the stakes are so much higher.

Lucy Pevensie has a cordial that will heal any injury with a couple of drops. When she finds her brother Edmund wounded on the battlefield, she gives him some at once and sits by his side. Aslan then has to remind her that there are countless other unnamed people wounded that she could be helping while she's wasting time with the brother who's already safe.

The horror of this event is diluted when the CTU crew and regular citizens later prowl around LA like nothing happened.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> episode "A Hole in the World", when Fred is infected with Illyria's essence and becoming her host, Angel and Spike travel to the Deeper Well, the resting place of the Old Ones, to save her, where the gravekeeper, Drogyn, tells them that if they drew Illyria back to her resting place, its essence would become a mystical airborne virus and kill thousands of people between England and L.A. Angel and Spike aren't willing to sacrifice all those people for one, though Angel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">briefly appears to consider it</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a scene that subverts this trope in the episode "Convictions", where G'Kar and Vir are on an elevator together. When Vir apologises (for his species' attempted genocide of G'Kar's), G'Kar cuts his palm.
<div class="indent"><strong>G'kar:</strong> <em>[timed to the blood drops spilling from his palm]</em> Dead... Dead... Dead... Dead... <em>Dead</em>. How do you apologize to them? <br/><strong>Vir:</strong> ...I can't. <br/><strong>G'kar:</strong> Then I cannot forgive.
</div></li><li> Averted a season or two before in "GROPOS": The titular "GROPOS" are infantry, several of whom had made friends with the main cast (in particular, one of the infantrywomen seemed to have developed the seeds of a relationship with Garibaldi) while using Babylon 5 as a staging area for a ground assault. The assault goes quite well (we see a news report about it), but the final shots make it clear that the GROPOS who had made friends with the established characters had died, and that many more of the unnamed GROPOS had died, and that was the real story. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> is shown lying dead among his fellow soldiers, as a reminder of how impersonal war is.
<ul><li> Note also that, during the final scene, a PADD is being passed hand-to-hand among the crowd watching the news report. This PADD holds a list of the casualties, and several of the un-named background characters turn away with crestfallen expressions, implying that they too had friends/acquaintances among the fallen. Stories Never Told...
</li></ul></li><li> Although the crew is pretty sure that President Clark is a xenophobic bastard that gradually converts Earth into a fascist state, and they receive evidence that he indeed masterminded the assassination of his predecessor, it is only him having several civilian transports destroyed with some 10,000 people killed that truly infuriates Sheridan and Ivanova and drives them to declaring an all-open war on Clark. On the other hand, it was their attempts to remove him from power without bloodshed that sparked his doing so.
</li><li> Also averted with the fate of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Markab</span>. When it becomes clear that there's unlikely to be a cure of the disease that plagues them, they gather together, lock themselves in and pray. Delenn and Lennier join the ones on Babylon 5 to give them comfort, even though they're not sure that they're immune to that species' disease. When the doors are reopened, the looks on Delenn's and Lennier's faces make it clear that they just witnessed an extinction.
</li><li> Discussed in one episode. The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vorlons</span> are sending a fleet to two different planets. One is the Centauri homeworld, and the other is a colony. When asked why Sheridan is amassing his own fleet at only one place, another character responds that they only have enough ships for one battle. Centauri Prime has 3 billion people living on it, the other world has 6 billion. As Marcus points out, it all comes down to cold, uncaring numbers—and ironically, Centauri Prime is the only one of the two that has named characters on it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Cylon attack which claimed billions of lives in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> is almost forgotten in comparison to the suffering of the main characters aboard the escaping ships. Seeing the baby in the Riverwalk Market and Cami die in the Miniseries is more upsetting than knowing that almost all children of the Colonies are now dead. Even the other survivors rarely get screen time, primarily because they don't live on the titular ship, but a single woman suffering from cancer takes up a great deal. Late in the fourth season during a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMutiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMutiny">mutiny</a> it is shown that the ordinary people very much keep it at the forefront of their minds, the main characters are unusual in having a broader view of things thanks to their experiences. Put simply, the lives of everyone is a mixture of nightmare, deprivation and mindless drudgery, but at least they are alive. Better to focus on the problems happening to them <em>now</em> than dwell on the genocide. But it is never forgotten. To be fair, that single woman with cancer <em>is</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the President</span>.
<ul><li> This is brought up in the trial of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Giaus Baltar</span>, where the prosecutor explains in her closing statements that such staggering loss is so difficult to comprehend, so instead, the focus turns to the scant thousands that remain.

Mitchell is a stereotypical hot vampire who's killed a lot of people and is emo about it, and sees other characters as villains just because they want to punish him for the thousands of people he's killed. But <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the spirit of one of his victims</span> tells Mitchell that he should stop acting like a victim, and if he really wanted to do something good, he would kill himself.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> fans lost all respect for Spike after his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a> of Buffy</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> tends to zigzag around this trope. When it comes to case selection, the lower the number of murders, the less urgency the team has to take on the case. However, when it comes to the victims themselves, the victims the team weren't able to rescue (or hadn't attempted to rescue), the most team does is mouth a few words of regret (if they show any remorse at all for them), with the team only caring about the victim if they have to go out and find a way to rescue them before it's too late. The two-parter "To Hell.. and Back" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this trope when the team discovers just how many victims the UnSub had managed to kidnap:
<div class="indent"><strong>Detective Benning:</strong> <em>[shocked at the discovery]</em> 89 pairs of shoes.. <br/><strong>Morgan:</strong> So, how many of them did there have to be before you started caring? 100? 200? <br/><strong>Benning:</strong> <em>[remains speechless]</em>

He was asked just before he pushed The Button how many children were on Gallifrey at that moment, and were about to die by his hand. He didn't know at the time, but he later counted (2.47 billion). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">"The Day of the Doctor"</a>, he ends up saving Gallifrey with his other incarnations in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime">Tricked Out Time</a> gambit, but due to the timelines being out of sync doesn't remember this so the point stands.</span>

Yes, the Peacekeepers are an evil army who torture prisoners, but there are unknown numbers of techs like Gilina on the base who aren't combatants or necessarily bad people. Yet the main cast never seem to have any qualms about the base's destruction. In contrast, when the Command Carrier (which has children and non-combatants living on it) is attacked two seasons later, the characters do make the point that there will be time to evacuate the inhabitants.

She expects Mirri Maz Dur to be grateful to her for saving her from being killed by the Dothraki - only to be reminded that her village was invaded, temple burned to the ground, friends and family all butchered and she herself raped three times - so she really doesn't have much to be grateful for.
</li><li> Tywin notes that the Red Wedding prevented thousands of deaths by ending the Northern rebellion without the friendly losses required to kill the same army in battle.

Stannis's burnings of unnamed characters are not given nearly as much weight as his eventual sacrifice of one: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his daughter Shireen</span>. The latter had been a recurring presence on the show.
</li><li> The final episode treats <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jon having to assassinate Daenerys</span> as a bigger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> than the previous episode featuring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Daenerys burning all of King's Landing to the ground and killing tens of thousands in the process</span> because the former was a main protagonist of the series and the aforementioned deaths were all featured extras who just appeared in one episode.
</li><li> Sansa shows zero remorse for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> betraying the secret of Jon's parentage to Tyrion</span> in the last few episodes, which leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Daenerys's allies betraying her, resulting in her burning all of King's Landing to the ground. Sansa never once seems to care that thousands of innocent civilians (not to mention surrendering soldiers) died because of her attempts at political scheming</span>. She merely says it was the "only way".
</li><li> The series initially went to great lengths to subvert the trope - showing how the small folk were affected by the scheming and machinations of the nobles; for example, Catelyn simply seizing Tyrion under suspect of attempting to murder Bran leads to Tywin having his armies slaughter innocent peasants in the Riverlands as revenge. Likewise <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ned Stark's execution and Joffrey's reign of terror</span> leads to massive riots and unrest amongst the civilians of King's Landing. But by the final seasons, this is ignored; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cersei blowing up the Sept of Baelor and wiping out House Tyrell and the Faith Militant in the process</span> gets barely a passing mention, and any times characters question the lack of food for the upcoming winter it's never followed up on (with no mention or signs of people starving).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show observes that this applies to good deeds as much a bad. If you buy the town a new school it just reminds people how rich you are but if you help raise one person out of poverty you're a hero.
</li><li> On a more regular basis, the cast tends to roll with this when they go after the heads of corporations and the like: you cheer for them because they helped whoever it was who originally came to team for help, but don't really think of the hundreds of others who might be hurt when the corrupt corporation gets shut down.
</li></ul></li><li> A memorable, early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> actually delves into this thought process and how it can keep a man sane in war. Hawkeye had just witnessed a good buddy of his from home die on the operating table, and goes outside to get out some well-deserved angst. When Henry Blake goes out to give comfort, he finds that Hawkeye isn't just mourning the fact that he lost a friend, but that he's witnessed innumerable casualties die in the same manner, and didn't cry for them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>. In order to save Teal'c's life, the main characters destroy a piece of technology that is stopping a Goa'uld invasion! (said invasion was not imminent or known about however - the defense was in place and so Goa'uld did not send troops there. Unfortunately one must have decided to send a scout at some point after the tech was destroyed). When the Goa'uld do invade in the second season, they destroy half of the planet's population. This is made worse by noting that the defense technology they disabled could probably have been circumvented by the humans.
<ul><li> They are very willing to admit their own faults, including when they personally screw up and cause some major disasters. People mess up, but as they are good it is usually unintentional and they try to make it up. The antagonists may point out valid faults, but as they themselves always do worse and don't even try to be good, Stargate Command still holds the high ground. Plus, they free the galaxy from thousands of years of domination and stagnation in just ten years. Broke a few eggs along the way though- whole worlds dropped off the map in part thanks to them with barely a mention, as befits this trope.
<ul><li> As mentioned above, they do get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">called on it</a> every now and then. Jacob <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after he takes a Tok'ra symbiote</span> points out that while SG-1 has done more in a few years than other factions who have been at work for centuries, their actions have created power vacuums among the System Lords that have resulted in massive amounts of killing. One episode in particular starts off playing the trope straight, then subverts it. the SG-1 travels to a planet where Teal'c had been to previously when he was First Prime for Apophis. He is brought to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">trial</a> for his crimes. He states at first that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">killed so many people</a> that he doesn't even remember this one world. Later in the episode he states that he regrets every single act he committed as First Prime, and that the he carries the weight of every person he killed in Apophis' name.
</li></ul></li><li> Teal'c offers some advice to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> former adversary at the end of the Ori arc about learning to live with yourself as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> when this trope wears off and the guilt sets in: you focus on doing the good you can <em>now</em> and never let yourself forget even if others try to offer you forgiveness.

<ul><li> Lampshaded in the episode "The Immunity Syndrome." When McCoy expresses disbelief that Spock is capable of "feeling" the deaths of four hundred Vulcans, Spock replies, "I have noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million."

</li><li> The theme of the episode "A Taste of Armageddon" is that adopting this attitude towards wars actually helps in facilitating it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kirk:</strong> Death... disease, destruction, horror... <em>that's</em> what war is all about, Anan. That's what makes it a thing to be avoided. You've made it neat and painless. So neat and painless that you've had no reason to stop it.

A god-like being settles down with a human wife and becomes a pacifist - but then a hostile race attacks their planet, and the being's wife is killed defending the planet. This angers the being into destroying the hostile race - the entire race of fifty billion. This is where Picard finds him, alone on the blighted planet with a simulacrum of his wife.

Garak and Captain Sisko show some sympathy over this, but on the whole it's pretty well skipped over.

Sisko makes it a point to read the name of every single Federation officer who is killed by the Dominion, and they even motivate his decision to betray Federation values in order to bring the Romulans into the war.

When Gaila sells weapons to The Regent, a tyrant who plans to use his weapons to kill 28 million of his own people to quell a rebellion, Quark yanks himself away from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> and risks his life to screw the deal, getting the Regent assassinated in the process, and forcing Gaila and his associate Hagath to flee.

The death toll of seven million becomes almost a mantra, deliberately repeated until it is burned into the minds of both the audience and everyone the <em>Enterprise</em> encounters.
<ul><li> Tucker's younger sister was killed in the attack and he spends time trying to avert this trope by insisting that she was no more important than any of the other casualties. Numerous characters try telling him that it is okay to acknowledge that she was more important to him, and that it is also okay to be more upset over her death.

Ten thousand Africans equal 1,000 Asians or other non-whites, equal 100 non-nearby whites, equals 10 nearby whites, which equals four alligators, equals one Finnish person "if you know them". They also ran an article assuring that there were "No Finnish Casualties Among the Dead Pope".
</li></ul></li><li> A similar rule applied to some British newspapers: "One Brit equals 10 Frogs (Frenchmen) equals 100 wogs (Mediterranean Europeans)".
<ul><li> A different version of that is, "One dead in Putney equals 10 dead in Paris equals 100 dead in Turkey equals 1,000 dead in India equals 10,000 dead in China" (though, of course, that last one also owes much to the "life is cheap in China" cliché, as China is home to literally <em>billions</em>).

The Imperium of mankind in particular contains such an absurd number of individuals that even counting exactly how many planets there are is pretty tough. There are literally millions of planets in the Imperium, some of which contain trillions of people, meaning that a <em>Billion</em> isn't just a statistic for the Imperium, it's a rounding error. The Imperial Guard consists of at least trillions of individual members, and of course several of the forces that the Imperium fights are operating on similar scales. There are also numerous stories focusing on particular individuals that can be surprisingly sympathetic and touching. This is a trap.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked Trope</a> by the Cadian Law of Decipherability for cemeteries on their planet. Due to necessary heavy militarization on the planet, death tolls are high while land is limited - thus, after a time at which graves' tombstones are found to be illegible, the graves are exhumed and the bones are tossed into a mass-grave pit to grant space for future burials, as the lack of a name on the graves proves no one will be remembering the individuals any longer.
</li><li> Imperial Guard Commander Chenkov of the Valhallan 18th is mentioned as sacrificing <em>10 million</em> Guardsmen without using artillery or armored support in a single conflict in order to end a year long siege. He did get a nice merit for it though.
<ul><li> Chenkov also built a wall out of the bodies of his men. Not the ones that died in conflict. When he wanted a wall he just ordered them to be executed!
</li></ul></li><li> A famous joke illustrating just how worthless human lives are in the setting is that entire planet populations are often lost because of <em>rounding errors on tax forms</em>. One story mentions an entire planet being accidentally drafted this way, and then posthumously sentenced to death for letting the now-abandoned world be conquered without a fight.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marines</a> are exceptionally powerful and skilled elite soldiers and are thus operating on extremely low numbers, by the standards of the setting at least (Based on given information there are at least hundreds of thousands if not millions of Space Marines). As a result they operate on the opposite end of the spectrum, where every loss sucks due to their relative rarity. This also translates well in game as Space marines are, model for model, far more valuable than something like a guardsmen and will generally operate in much smaller groups. However this means that losing even a single squad of Marines is can be very costly, while the Guard can often afford to sacrifice a <em>squad or two</em> just to keep a small group of elite enemies busy. This can actually a surprisingly effective tactic, particularly if the unit in question is has a limited number of attack and thus will take several turns to finish shredding through the guardsmen.
</li><li> The Eldar take this view on the loss of other species. They view the survival of themselves and their brethren as the utmost priority and the deaths of innumerable numbers of the "lesser species" inconsequential. They'll happily engineer war or destruction of entire planets or solar systems of other speices to ensure the safety of Eldars.
</li><li> Saying Orks may die at the hands of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Warboss implies the possibility they won't</a>. If they didn't, their WAAGH wouldn't stay together. Plus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries">the Orks come back soon after anyway...</a> It's been said that if the Orks managed to actually all work together, nothing in the galaxy could stop them. Of course saying that "A Million is a Statistic" applies to the Orks may be misleading, as it implies they actually care about other Orks dying, or that they have any understanding of statistics.
</li><li> There's no real way to say how many Tyranids there are, mostly because you can't really count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Tyranids as individual beings</a>. That being said their modus operandi is to show up to a planet, kill any resistance then consume every living thing on the planet for biomass. Tyranids dying in the process isn't really an issue, since they just harvest the biomass of their own dead in the end as well.
</li><li> The trope is played horribly straight by the setting's post-human Batman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> Konrad Curze<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note44w6o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note44w6o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note44w6o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> aka Night Haunter, Primarch of the scariest legion of Astartes in the galaxy. Arguably even more the case after he rebelled and got assassinated by an agent of the God-Emperor, as now his boys have no-one holding their leashes</span>: he transformed his dark, gloomy and rainy homeworld from a terrified crime-ridden anarchic hellhole into a terrified crime-free dystopian police state by brutally murdering lawbreakers. Not in job lots though, not until they made him their king, but one by one criminals would disappear, only to be found later brutally killed, and rarely in one piece.
</li><li> Tau Ethereals play this trope straight. You can lose several squads of your fire warriors, but god forbid if the Ethereal dies (recent rule changes seems to have inverted this, as the Ethereal dying grants a bonus instead of a handicap now).
</li></ul></li><li> Regular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> has its own examples. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen">Skaven</a> live by this rule, happily firing their artillery into their own troops, as long as it's hitting the enemy too (they're the only faction allowed to do so, in fact). Greenskins such as Orcs and Goblins also aren't overly worried about individuals dying. The Vampires counts also field massive armies of expendable undead. That said in all three cases the armies do still have some more valuable elite units, and losing those can be quite problematic. Of course other races like Dwarves and Warriors of Chaos are on the opposite end of the spectrum, appearing almost exclusively in much smaller numbers. Losing a few dozen Skaven or Orcs and Goblins to kill a handful of Warriors of Chaos, Dwarves or similar races is often a notable victory.

Several sourcebooks list horrible events in the game's back story, some involving entire <em>planets</em> being razed. It's implied with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">orbital bombardment</a> from warships. While the InnerSphere has Warships as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> when the Clans arrived, the Clans have several. The Smoke Jaguar Clan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">bombed a planet</a> after Prince Hohiro Kurita escaped. The Clan council banned orbital bombardment as <em>dishonorable</em> as the backlash unites the InnerSphere. One Jade Falcon warship captures a world by threatening to hit it from orbit, hoping no one will call their bluff.

Granted, you're just rolling dice and moving pieces of plastic around. You never stop to consider how many Green soldiers you would be sending to their deaths just to seize Kamchatka from the Blue Army. The game really only ends when all but one of the armies has been annihilated.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em>, the Great Cataclysm which brought Rifts Earth to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AftertheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AftertheEnd">current state</a>, and the random Rifts demons, and other catastrophes that came after nearly made humanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">extinct</a>. This is brought up many times in various sourcebooks, but the numbers are so huge they're hard for someone reading the books to imagine.
</li><li> In any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> campaign that features the Outer Planes (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em>) it is common knowledge that even a small battle in the Blood War is at least a hundred times bigger than any fought among mortals, and casualties can often amount to millions on <em>both</em> sides. This becomes even remarkable when you consider that neither side has made any progress towards winning the conflict since it started eons ago. While it's hard to feel sorry for fiends, the thought of incredible loss of life that the war causes can often make one pause.
<ul><li> One official <em>Planescape</em> adventure takes the players to a place called the Field of Nettles which is a frequent battlefield in the Blood War. The place doesn't have landscape, it has <em>gargantuan piles of bodies</em> that never rot for some unknown reason. The piles are so grand they make large hills or small mountains, and there are so many that the Field has become a maze, nigh-impossible to navigate without flying support. Whole armies can be outfitted just from scavenging the piles. Even the adventure can only barely reflect on the sheer death toll of mortal and immortal lives that goes into making the place, and is more concerned with the logistics of crossing it while worrying about fiendish patrols.
<ul><li> If the players are successful in completing the objective of this mission - finding the battle plans of the infernal armies of Hell - and then read them, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they discover that the Field of Nettles was <em>not</em> considered to have any strategic importance, and was actually used as a distraction to lure the demons from another battlefield that they <em>really</em> considered important. In other words, the devils were willing to sacrifice millions of soldiers for nothing more than a <em>diversionary tactic</em>. The revelation should hit the players <em>very</em> hard at that point</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> setting for D&amp;D, Cyre (aka the Mournland) gets varying levels of this trope depending on where one lived before the end of the Last War, as do the casualties of the War itself. Most of Cyre's neighbors are perfectly willing to ignore the nation's death (except when they're being paranoid about the cause of the Day of Mourning and its possible repetition) and the loss of life of every soldier and civilian in the nation, mostly because everyone's so exhausted by war. Many Cyrans strive to make sure Cyre isn't forgotten and that others remember everyone who died was a person with loved ones, while visiting the Mournland is quite the pointed reminder: nothing rots in the Mournland, so every corpse is there in perfect condition.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantYearZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantYearZero">Mutant: Year Zero</a></em> averts this trope significantly, billions of people died at the end of the world and only a small number of them survived in small pockets. And the game emphasizes this loss by having the populations of the PC's races act as an in the game timer, a timer that tics down every session with a six-sided dice roll. So there's only so much of a stable population in the Core Rule Book and Source Books; around two hundred in The Ark, one-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninety in Genlab and just about ten-thousand in Elysium-1. The robots of Mechatron-7 are incalculable. Once it reaches zero, it's game over.

</li><li> To an extent, regular soldiers as well. Since an entire military unit is represented by a single sprite, a player is unlikely to be too choked up by the loss of hit points, representing members of the unit, as long as the guy is still standing. <em>IV</em> and <em>V</em> address this by making each unit composed of several figures, but it's still not very daunting to see half of them get slaughtered, knowing that they can fortify in one place and eventually regenerate.

Planetary invasions involve tens of millions of troops, on each side, <em>per battle</em>, and every single attempt at invading a planet is noted to cause the death of billions of people.

</li><li> Played with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>. Just before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>, the game takes time to show an average man bidding farewell to his wife and child, possibly for the last time, before setting off for war. The image will stay with you.
</li><li> In one sidequest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, the player must choose to save either a small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits">Rag Tag Bunch Of Misfits</a> they've bonded with in an earlier scene, or a dreadnought full of sailors they've never met. Tellingly, most players go for the former.
<ul><li> Even more tellingly is that the most often cited reason for choosing the latter is not 'There were something dangerously close to a thousand sailors who there was no evidence of escaping the doomed vessel' but rather 'I needed the Qunari to fight the demons'. Even the people who choose to save the faceless many instead of the likable few didn't do so as a subversion of this trope at all. Although another common cited reason is the information provided by the continued Qunari alliance will save far more people in the long run than the Chargers ever could, so the trope isn't always <em>completely</em> played straight here.
</li><li> Another side quest prioritizing the needs of the few over the needs of the many is the Inquisitor discovering that the Mayor of Crestwood <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">isolated and flooded a few dozen Blight-infected refugees to keep them from infecting the rest of his village</span> during the Fifth Blight. Considering the Blight is <em>extremely</em> deadly, contagious, and incurable, the fact is he saved far more lives <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by flooding the infected refugees</span> than not. Except, the game depicts his actions as purely monstrous on account of the few dozen lives he ended over the hundreds he saved with that action.
</li><li> Discussed with Iron Bull, who actually takes you to meet random people under your command twice, so you can put names and faces to the adoring masses who worship you but whom you might not feel any personal connection to.
</li><li> Aside from these two quests, the game often bends over backwards trying to avert the trope. The game often emphasizes how many millions of people will die from the Breach <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then Corypheus</span>, yet the player is often shown random civilians struggling to get by in a world gone mad to generate pathos. Most side quests in the Hinterlands (the largest explorable area in the game) involve finding food, blankets, and medical care for random people you've never met, and if you do then for the rest of the game you'll randomly hear random background NPC's blessing the Inquisitor for making their lives better. You can spend a lot of time getting to know random people working for you in Haven <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then, when Haven is attacked, you end up saving those same people in the wreckage</span>. Companions Sera and Iron Bull often take a lot of time telling you how you should care about the nameless faceless people who work for you, and most characters will take at least one moment every thirty seconds to emphasize the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatASenselessWasteOfHumanLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatASenselessWasteOfHumanLife">tragic waste of human life</a> the countless deaths at the Conclave, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haven</span>, Orlesian Civil War, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Corpheus</span> cause, rather than just focusing on the fact that tons of people died. YMMV on how successful this was to most players.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>, where the death of one dwarf is a tragedy, but the death of two hundred Dwarfs is a very successful use of magma.
<ul><li> It can be averted, however, in the fact that <em>every single dwarf</em> (and plenty of other creatures) is unique, with different personalities and tastes (and, in the new version, <em>physical appearance</em>). Therefore, it's not uncommon to grow very attached to your little dwarves, and mourn their loss.
</li><li> Which means it's playing it straight, because as easy as it is to feel attached to your original seven dwarves, as the numbers pile up, they become more and more meaningless.

<ul><li> You can say the same for any game based on a large-scale war, and in fact, there <em>are</em> a few instances where the plight of the common folk is integral to the story (in particular, the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Liu Bei leading the peasants out of Chang Ban). The main reason DW makes such a huge deal out of certain deaths is that's how it was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>, which, as anyone who's read it will tell you, is <em>very</em> heavy on drama.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII">Fable III</a></em> subverts this handily.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em>, one of the central characters, the Jackal, who you were hired to kill to put an end to his arms dealing which is only fanning the flames of the various civil wars that are going on in Africa, makes a very good point about this during one of his interview tapes which can be found in the game. During one of the tapes, he mentions that despite how powerful the U.S military is (and he would know, being a former Navy SEAL before he became an arms dealer), they let petty morality get in the way of doing whatever it takes to win, and that their media focuses too much on how many of our servicemen and women die in combat when they need to realize that soldiers dying is part of the cost of war. He notes that the American public can't accept heavy casualties and care more about the deaths of individuals rather than honor the cause they died for, stating that "the death of a 23 year old from Iowa gets more air time than the death of 50,000 people he gave his life to protect. So even if they did give a shit, their own media prevents them from taking any action." The death of even one of our troops is a tragedy, while the death of those he was fighting for even if goes into the thousands or millions is a statistic, and the Jackal is disgusted at the hypocrisy of this. It is for this reason that he believes that his arms dealing is actually helping the world - if the U.S Military won't do anything to stem the tide of all these terrible wars going on in the world then he will.

Seriously, does anyone even remember that she <em>ate a thousand people?</em> To be fair, in story it's actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a> as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sakura</span> is struggling with guilt about the town yet is no doubt pleased about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zouken and probably even Shinji</span>. It's demonstrated that she mentally collapses if Shirou is not around to help, and Shirou himself is trying to pick up the tattered scraps of his idealism for letting it happen. But to the players? Only upset about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Saber</span>, if at all.
<ul><li> The fact that she had <em>absolutely no idea</em> that she was killing any of the people in the town, and was not at all in control of her actions at that point (she saw it all as a nightmare), probably has a lot to do with it as well. As soon as she realises what she has been doing, she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">refuses to go to sleep, and then goes to confront her grandfather the next day in order to end it all. Granted, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">goes wrong</a>, but at least she <em>tried</em>... The only people she actually consciously kills are the aforementioned asshole victims, who most definitely deserved it</span>. However, arguably Shirou <em>can</em> be blamed for this, because he doesn't take the opportunity to kill her even after he finds out that she has done this (although, doing so in the game is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually a bad choice, because her servant (rather predictably) kills him if he does, and this is likely to send Sakura insane with no possibility of being redeemed or stopped</span>)
</li><li> Contrast with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caster</span>, who hospitalizes, disfigures and <em>castrates</em> large quantities of people during <em>Unlimited Blade Works</em>. What most people will likely hold up as her primary act of evil is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taking Taiga hostage and kidnapping Saber</span>, and most of it is forgiven <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by the time she dies beautifully in the arms of her beloved</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Both averted and played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>. After all, when your game is about heroic eco-terrorists, there's no escaping this trope:
<ul><li> Cloud's paycheck putting a dent in Marlene's educational funding is given more attention than the fact that Cloud and AVALANCHE just returned from bombing a power plant, probably killing hundreds of people.
</li><li> Barret breaks down when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie are killed by Shinra, and he thinks Marlene has been killed by the collapsing Sector 7 pillar</span>. Cait Sith <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calls Barret out on this</a> later in the game, when he asks him how many people AVALANCHE killed when they blew up that reactor. Barret actually tries to refute him <em>with this trope</em>, but Cait Sith shoots him down, and Barret doesn't seem fully convinced of his own argument.
</li><li> The destruction of Sector 7 is a rare (for this game) villainous example of this trope. After all, apart from Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie, <em>nobody the audience knows was killed</em> — and so Reno, the man directly responsible for the destruction, is never brought to justice for his actions. Hell, in <em>Advent Children</em>, he's a comic relief character who nobody takes very seriously.
</li><li> Impressively however, the game manages to simultaneously avert <em>and</em> play this trope straight in regards to the destruction of the planet. While <em>FFVII</em> is ultimately yet another "save the world from destruction" plot (and would thus be highly susceptible to this trope), the threat maintains its emotional intensity because <em>the planet itself is a living organism</em>, with it's own blood and spiritual essence (the lifestream), and possibly even sentience.

But the destruction of Kilika and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mass slaughter of Al-Bhed and Crusaders at Operation Mi'ihen</span> are the most heart-wrenching, devastating events in the game, and the characters respond to these with far, far more sorrow than even the aforementioned instances.
<ul><li> Yuna's Guardians were far more unhappy with the idea that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuna has to die to accomplish the final summoning</span> than the idea that Sin kills <em>thousands</em> if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she</span> doesn't. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Also, it was insane that they simply didn't have a stock of fully trained summoners/final fayth ready and willing to beat up sin the SECOND it shows up.

<ul><li> Because even trying to reach the Final Fayth is likely to kill the Summoner, and summoning it to defeat Sin. In fact, most Summoners either eventually give up and turn back at Mount Gagazet OR die while trying to pass Mount Gagazet. If the Ronso didn't help Yuna, it would of been an even more treacherous journey, though the presence of a certain Boss makes you feel it's difficulty anyway.

Everyone else, however, including all the Guardians and the entire Al-Bhed people, do not need such an argument - a single death is apparently too much for these residents of post-apocalyptic Spira to bear thinking about, even though every one of them has lost someone they care about to Sin. In fact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Al-Bhed are more than willing to kidnap Summoners who are going to sacrifice their lives of their own free will, and imprison them for life to stop those Summoners from making the honest and heroic choice to give themselves for the greater good - and the player is clearly expected to agree with them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>?</span>

</li><li> In the space RTS <em>Haegemonia: Legions of Iron</em> the conventional mean of subduing enemy planets is orbital bombardment. Preferably with viral torpedoes - they are more effective. All you get to see at that is the down-counting number of the population. 100 millions...85 millions...50 millions...c'mon, give up already...40 millions...you're not the only planet I have to conquer, you know...30 millions...25 millions...finally! Welcome to the family! As a token of my clemency, I'll now lower the taxes until you all love and admire me, savvy?

<ul><li> In-game, the player can toy with this trope in various ways regarding their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">Red Shirt</a> NPC allies. Some players will work hard to make sure all their allies survive, while others (particularly on higher difficulties) will not bat an eye as their allies are cut down. Of course, how one reacts to the death of an NPC ally may depend on how useful they are; the loss of a rocket jockey or a Warthog gunner will usually cause more upset than the death of someone who only had an Assault Rifle.
</li><li> While the series has several parts where the objective is to rescue NPC soldiers, you can then often let all your newly-freed allies die without having anyone comment on it. A notable exception is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>'s second mission, where if you let an entire Marine squad die, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> will actually point it out.

Additionally, the audio logs are designed to emphasize the point that the currently empty city you're wandering through was inhabited by actual human beings who had their lives completely disrupted by the Covenant invasion.
</li><li> Horribly deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em>, where you play as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">semi-expendable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Spartan-III</a>.

</li><li> The opening cutscene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em> includes shots of the Covenant invasion of some unnamed planet, displaying Banshees bombarding masses of fleeing civilians and Elites running through the crowds impaling people on Energy Swords. The horror of it is used by Doctor Halsey to emphasize that, despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">terrible measures</a> taken to create the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Spartan</a> program, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">sacrificing a few for the sake of millions more was worth it in the end</a>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Prisoner:</strong> Kill a million people with a mighty star cruiser and you are a war hero. Kill a hundred with a thermal detonator and you are a terrorist.
</div><ul><li> Also on Manaan, Sunry tries to invoke this when you accuse him of murder, pointing out that you've killed a bunch of Sith yourself. Jolee calls him on it, saying that killing enemy combatants in battle during war and killing a person in their sleep are just a teensy bit different.
</li></ul></li><li> Possibly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, when a reporter who confronted you in the first game shows up again to demand another interview of you. One of the many ways it can go is the reporter demanding on-air to know why Shepard sacrificed thousands of people for the sake of the Citadel Council — and Shepard replying to her anonymous, faceless "thousands" by stating from memory the names of all 8 ships that were lost, and expressing his/her respect for the lost soldiers and the great deed they did. 2400 lives vs 10000 lives during that fateful battle.
<ul><li> Mordin deliberately averts this - when enacting the genophage (a mass sterilisation of a violent race, to which only one in a thousand give birth), he chose to keep visiting the world himself to study the results, to keep the reality of what he had done in his mind. He also averts this before heading out on the suicide mission - in order to have a clear picture of what he's fighting for, he calls his favourite nephew. In his loyalty mission, he even states that all life is precious.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Mordin</strong>: <em>Yearly recon missions. Water, tissue samples. Ensure no mistakes. Superiors offered to carry it on. Refused. Needed to see it in person. Need to look. Need...to see. Accept it as necessary. (inhale) See small picture. Remind myself why I run a clinic on Omega.</em>
</div><ul><li> As well as the scale of conflict, the First Contact war had about 623 casualties on the human side over the span of 3 months compared to what will normally happen with deaths in the thousands
</li><li> Further averted concerning the Citadel Battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> when you encounter an asari on Illium who first seems like a two-dimensional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>, but if you manage to get through her, she will reveal that the cause of her bitterness was the loss of her daughters on Citadel. And if you manage to put the pieces together, you will realize that those daughters were two very minor characters you spoke once or twice in the course of the first game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> repeatedly reminds you of the scale of the death and destruction that's happening everywhere <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that the Reapers invade</span>. At one point you see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a young boy die while trying to escape</span>.
</li><li> A better example might be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Liara's</span> reaction to the destruction of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thessia</span>. She was by no means uncaring towards Shepard or Garrus when they respectively lost Earth and Palaven, but it wasn't until her own world got destroyed that she had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>. Note that she does not come across as unsympathetic or selfish in any way, and her stunned exclamation of "My home!" when she saw the devastation is a very believable and tearjerking reaction.
</li><li> This trope is extensively discussed throughout the game; Garrus and Shepard have a long talk about "the ruthless calculus of war", of sacrificing a million over here so that a billion over there might survive, and there are various times when a sacrifice of some kind has to be made, and it's up to the player whether to take the personal or pragmatic option.
</li><li> Over the course of the game you'll see news reports and e-mails about how minor characters met over the course of the series fall in battle one by one. You even come across the body of a Krogan poet you met in the second game, and can deliver a last message he left for his wife.
</li><li> When you meet Grunt, however, the trope might be purely represented. Depending on your previous choices, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you meet a rachni queen that is friendly to you. You must fight a lot of enemies in order to rescue her, while Grunt and his company of elite troopers are fighting in another location. However, both your team and Grunt's company are overrun by enemy. You have to either go rescue Grunt, which leaves the rachni queen to enemy hands, or call Grunt to fall back and assist you. Grunt will leave his position just to help you, but without his lead his companions are doomed to death. Then Grunt might die as well while covering your retreat, or can survive, in both cases bearing a lot of emotion in the cutscenes and for the plot. His company results utterly decimated, but no tear is dropped for those soldiers, who play the role of masked nameless strong mooks. Only the life of Grunts play an emotional role. His death is a tragedy; their death is almost unnoticed</span>.

Not only is this moment the most famous, it's also widely regarded as the most disturbing scene. Many players had to stop after this scene, because they found it too disturbing.

When the characters learn mid-way through the game that the population of Expel (roughly one billion or so people) is gone, they are <em>horrified</em>. (And many have a reason to - Bowman, Precis, Leon, and Rena all have family there.) But then comes the ending wherein <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that billion people will be returned... at the cost of roughly a billion Nedians instead</span>. This is played as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>, and the characters by this point are <em>very</em> adverse to this.

</div></li><li> Somewhere in the middle is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> series; while most conflicts are between large masses of troops, the game also tracks the statistics of individual units; players are less likely to sacrifice an experienced, well-equipped and well-armored unit as mere cannon fodder as a result. Also, it does implement individual characters in the form of faction leaders and heirs, the preservation of which is often an important consideration.
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShogunTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShogunTotalWar">Shogun: Total War</a></em> you could have the game print out detailed logs of each battle you physically fought in which the game will list <em>every</em> soldier on your side (within reason, as it stops printing after several lines of text) with their individual name, skill, morale levels etc etc. Although this option is not available in later games, the game does keep track of every individual soldier separately.

<ul><li> This is the reason that ads to recruit sponsors for poor people in developing countries focus on a single child, instead of the thousands or millions of people in the neighborhood just like him or her.
</li><li> A joke (with many variants) goes something like this: two national leaders (let's say, the top political guy and the top military guy) are sitting in a diner, planning a war. They decide to kill a million citizens, and a completely unrelated bicycle repairman/pizza delivery driver/clown. They pitch this idea to a random bystander who is shocked to hear that they would go out of their way to kill the unrelated civilian. One leader turns to the other and says, "see, I told you no one would care about killing the million enemy citizens."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard">Eddie Izzard</a> has a section in his comedy show <em>Dressed To Kill</em> where he discusses this in relation to Pol Pot.
<div class="indent"> "Pol Pot killed 1.7 million people. We can't even deal with that! You know, we think if somebody kills someone, that's murder, you go to prison. You kill 10 people, you go to Texas, they hit you with a brick, that's what they do. 20 people, you go to a hospital, they look through a small window at you forever. And over that, we can't deal with it, you know? Someone's killed 100,000 people. We're almost going, "Well done! You killed 100,000 people? You must get up very early in the morning. I can't even get down the gym! Your diary must look odd: Get up in the morning, death, death, death, death, death, death, death  lunch- death, death, death -afternoon tea - death, death, death - quick shower"

Foxworthy said "the only thing I could think was 'How on earth did they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownCar">get 80 people on a bus</a>?'....once it becomes a physics problem, it takes the emotional sting out of it."
