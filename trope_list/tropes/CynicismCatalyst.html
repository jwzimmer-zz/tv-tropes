<ul><li> The main character Shinn Asuka has his life changed forever when his little sister Mayu is accidentally blown up alongside their parents when they got caught in the crossfire of a major battle. To the point where Shinn carries around her cell phone and listens to her "leave a message after the beep" recording when he gets down.
</li><li> It is lampshaded upon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Super Robot Wars Z</a></em>, after being taken out of his berserker streak by Stella Louissier if they saved her earlier. When back at base, Shinn's girlfriend Lunamaria Hawke is concerned that Stella is going to be a contender for Shinn's heart, but Shinn tells her that he sees Stella as a platonic brother-sister relationship. Making up for your mistake theres huh Shinn?

</li><li> Dias's motivation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarOceanEX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarOceanEX">Star Ocean EX</a></em> was his dead sister.
</li><li> Mikagami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca">Flame of Recca</a></em>, whose older sister died early.

Sara's dead schoolmates also fit the "failed to protect" mold, giving her post-traumatic stress syndrome for a long time afterward.
</li><li> Chester, the archer in the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>, is driven incessantly by his need for revenge after Mars kills his little sister (his only family) while he is out hunting with the main character. He is so driven that he appears to give up sleep entirely, instead using the night to practice his bowmanship.
</li><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal">Blade of the Immortal</a></em> put down his sword after his Bounty Hunter lifestyle led him to accidentally kill his sister's husband (he'd never met him before), causing said sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOphelia">to mentally revert to a child-like state</a> to cope. He picks it back <em>up</em> after his refusal to fight later resulted in his sister being graphically sliced to pieces. The story deals with his need to balance the two extremes; of course, the whole thing leans more towards violence, but generally it's for a good cause.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em>, a young girl named Ai whom Akito meets in an underground shelter shortly before it's attacked by enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> serves as a kind of Cynicism Catalyst to him. Eventually it turns out that she didn't die, but instead was sent first forward, then backward in time, and grew up to be one of the major characters, the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist">Hot Scientist</a>, Inez Fressange.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru">Narutaru</a></em> has Shiina Tamai's older sister, Mishou, who died few after Shiina's birth. Her death tore the family apart and it'd take more than a decade and <em>another</em> death to patch things up.
</li><li> Ken Ichijouji of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> has a big brother who dies, and it certainly tears him apart.
</li><li> Neo Saiba's digital world takeover in the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DigimonVTamer01" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DigimonVTamer01">Digimon V-Tamer 01</a></em> is motivated by his little sister who is in a wheelchair.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein">Noein</a></em> the pseudo-villain/anti-hero Atori watched his little sister step on a land mine. Atori's attachment to Miho is most likely due to her resemblance to his dead sister.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> the brothers Guiseppe and Jean are both seeking revenge for the death of their sister Enrica at the hands of terrorists. The names of their chosen weapons, the cyborgs 'Henrietta' and 'Rico', reflect this. The difference is that Jean is cold-blooded towards Rico (deliberately behaving like a jerk), whereas Guiseppe has created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">surrogate</a> in Henrietta, even (in the manga chapter "Fantasma") making her wear one of Enrica's dresses. Though Jean is visibly shocked by this act, he is unable to find the strength to reprimand his brother.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki">Saiyuki</a></em>, Hakkai's sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">and lover</a> Kanan was kidnapped and raped by youkai, and not wanting to give birth to a youkai child, killed herself right in front of him. This event left him hurt and with feelings of rage that he tries to put away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a></em>'s backstory. Mewtwo wasn't the only thing being cloned; a little girl who died in a car crash and three other Pokemon were as well. The four became friends via Mewtwo's psychic link, but the experiment went wrong and all but Mewtwo died. To really drive the nail home, the scientists unintentionally induced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> on him when they stabilized him, leaving him only with a subconscious memory of a friend who died for nothing. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">did not end well</a> when he was finally released and was told they're gonna experiment with him.
</li><li> All the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymores</a> share more or less the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>: family murdered by Youma, exiled from their village, and then are forced to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a>. That means that each Claymore has her complex and Cynicism Catalyst. A significant part of the story is about the various way each of them react with that, such as starting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>, feeling guilty of being the only survivor, or going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>.
</li><li> Leon Oswald from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar">Kaleido Star</a></em> has a dead little sister. Her name was Sophie, she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterTeam">his partner</a> as well, and was killed in a car accident before a big competition <em>in front of Leon himself</em>. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">still blames himself</a>, and is always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">looking for someone like Sophie</a> to a pretty destructive extreme), which leads him to main girl Sora Naegino.
</li><li> In <em>Dr Koto</em>, a journalist come to ruin Koto's life again, full of bitterness after his little sister died from Koto's lack of care.
</li><li> In the manga and anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ProjectARMS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ProjectARMS">Project ARMS</a></em>, Ryo Takatsuki goes on a brief downward spiral after believing he caused the death of his childhood friend and girl he loved Katsumi. When it turns out she was really alive, he spends most of the series traveling from Japan to America with his friends to rescue her, only to watch her be killed by his own hands by accident (the bad guy threw her in front of himself as Ryo attacked), which causes Ryo to nearly bring about the end of the world out of his guilt and sadness. <em>Then</em>, when it turns out she's not dead again but is implanted with ARMS of her own and kidnapped by the evil organization Ryo's been fighting, he must again battle his sadness while setting off to rescue her. Wow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inari's adoptive father Kaito was brutally beaten and executed by corrupt business men's thugs when he tried to stop them from taking over their village. Inari then angrily declared heroes don't exist and nothing can stop bad guys.

</li><li> Zai Vessalius, whose cold, and arrogant demeanor and his rejection of Oz can be better explained by him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having his son be stillborn and Jack switching his son with him, and then his wife dying in a carriage accident. Then his brother's wife and child died as well, leaving Zai alone to wallow in his misery and blame Oz the B-rabbit for something he did not do.</span>
</li><li> And perhaps the most ultimate example, is that of Jack Vessalius, who started his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he met Lacie, Oswald's sister, who gave him a reason to exist.

When she died from a sickness, he became bitter and changed from being a kind young boy to a cold young man who would gladly backstab his best friend for power.
</li><li> Kousei from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril">Your Lie in April</a></em> stopped playing the piano and became a very cynical boy since his mother died; at least until he met Kaori and slowly reignited his passion of music.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The King Aultcray</span> was originally a decent man and greatly skilled tactician until his sister's presumed death.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shinya Kougami's descent to a latent criminal is brought by the brutal death of his Enforcer and close friend, Mitsuru Sasayama. When he found out that Makishima is one of the two people responsible for his death and the Sibyl System ordered the bureau to capture him alive instead of executing him, Kougami ended up leaving the bureau to take matter into his own hands.
</li><li> Inverted for Akane who realized how flawed the Sibyl System after she learned that they couldn't do anything to judge Makishima for killing her best friend. This experience made her into a realist, knowing that she cannot always rely on the system.
</li></ul></li><li> Char Aznable of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> wanted revenge on the Zabis for allegedly poisoning his father which forced him and his sister into exile. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin">Origin</a></em> manga gave him a bigger Cynicism Catalyst where the death of his mother hammered it to the point of becoming violent much to his sister's horror.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lelouch despises his home country after his father failed to explain his mother's assassination and sent him and Nunnally to Japan which he invaded later on. But when he received the power of Geass, he wanted to make a peaceful world for his sister despite his morally questionable methods. Then, it goes straight to the point when his actions got several of his friends in danger and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the death of Shirley broke him up which caused him to go on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> on the Britannian research facility that experimented on the Geass users and attempt to get Rolo killed for murdering Shirley</span>.
</li><li> Suzaku Kururugi changed when Euphemia died in the hands of Zero. When he found out that Zero is his best friend Lelouch, he felt betrayed and had him captured and delivered to the Emperor where he earned a promotion as a Knight of Rounds and had his best friend's memories of his mother, his sister and his Zero identity temporarily erased.
</li><li> Cornelia li Britannia hated the Japanese because she believed that her half-siblings, Lelouch and Nunually, were reportedly dead while exiled in Japan. Then, her sister, Euphemia, was killed by Zero, who turned out to be her supposedly dead half-brother, much to her despair. A similar level of cynicism and biterness in other royals, such as Clovis, can also be attributed to the believed deaths of Lelouch and Nunnally.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, the Tournament of Power becomes this towards Universe 11's Toppo and the Pride Troopers. Their entire universe ran on the ideals of justice, which their counterparts on Universe 2, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> trio Kamikaze Fireballs and their friends, used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>. However, while Love helped them and others out, justice didn't — the Pride Troopers were knocked down to just three of their number due to the power of the Saiyans, especially the meek Saiyan Kale of Universe 6. The final straw was when their attempt to defeat the assassin Hit lead to their number dropping to three, especially when Goku, whom Toppo called a villain for giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Zen-Oh</a> the reminder for the Tournament of Power, dropped in to help Hit. After this, Toppo told remaining members Jiren and Dyspo that there was no justice or evil, only survival and erasure.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Haikyuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Haikyuu">Haikyuu!!</a></em> Tsukishima Kei used to look up to his older brother Akiteru who had a passion for volleyball and told him that he was Karasuno's ace. When Tsukishima went to one of his matches (against his brother's will) it turns out that Akiteru wasn't even on the bench and had been lying all the time to not disappoint him. That was the moment when Tsukishima came to the conclusion that being passionate about volleyball (or anything really) only means that you will suffer later because there's always someone better out there.

However, his real regret isn't what happened to him (disowned by his own family, getting inflicted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichesToRags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichesToRags">Riches to Rags</a> and forced to work from the ground up to regain his noble status) but rather that he never learned anything of what happened to Chiwa, the girl who he fell in love with in the first place. As far as Turkish knew, she might have suffered worse treatment than he did from her countrymen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">all because of him</a>. Learning from both Romio and Juliet (the former happens to be Chiwa's son) that Chiwa cherished their short time together and that she still found happiness later in life allowed Turkish to move on from his guilt.

</div></li><li> Before Kyle Rayner leaves Earth after being traumatized by the brutal hate crime inflicted on his gay assistant Terry, he tells his then-girlfriend Jade (Jennifer-Lynn Hayden, daughter of the first Green Lantern) about his insights into the human psyche during his time as Ion, and what they revealed to him about man's inhumanity to man, which unfortunately is still true today:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kyle Rayner:</strong> Jen, I can't do this anymore. <br/><strong>Jen:</strong> Do what? <br/><strong>Kyle Rayner:</strong> Protect Earth.

When I was Ion I felt it, too. Jen, there is good in this world, but it doesn't measure up to the bad. In the hearts of humanity, there is anger, there is rape, there is brutality... there is hate. It took this happening to Terry to... ...to break me. I can't help these people now. I don't want to. Earth will have to get by without me.

But then they happened upon a mob killing, the mobster killed his wife and kids before his eyes to prevent witnesses, and when he wasn't allowed to testify because the justice system was in the Mafia's hand, he (understandably) snapped and decided to take justice into his own hands... and thus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> was born.

Oddly, despite having clearly been rather close with her, Angel displays no issues one way or the other regarding little girls.
</li><li> The biggest instance of this in the entire Buffyverse in what happened to Wesley.

His moment involves the gang rape and murder of his beloved fiancee, Vickie, the contingent murder of their unborn child, and his own near-fatal wounding at the hands of members of the 23rd Street Killers, a street gang. He suffers a psychotic break and becomes a murdering vigilante intent on exacting his revenge on the 23rd Street Killers, though his memories of these actions remain foggy until he is confronted with them by the FBI team. When Rossi comments that his survival was a miracle, implying that he should be thankful to be alive (a twist on the "This isn't what she would have wanted!" exhortation), Johnny responds by screaming, "You think living was a MIRACLE?" He ends up incarcerated in a mental institution where he spends his days drawing pictures of his dead fiancee and calling her cellphone just to hear her voice on her voicemail message.
</li><li> In one episode of the second season, JJ tells Morgan and Reid about how her childhood fear of the woods stemmed from finding the body of someone at a summer camp she worked at as a teenager.

This forces Nikita to have to stop him, as Percy has set up several "little black boxes" filled with sensitive information that would bring down the U.S. government, set to be automatically released in the event of his death.
</li><li> This trope is what leads to Michael being recruited to Division in the first place: his wife and child were killed in a car bomb meant for him, and Percy promised to help him track down the man responsible. Nikita is the one who eventually helps Michael get revenge, and it is that plus Percy's lies that lead to Michael's eventual defection to Nikita by the end of season 1.

His younger sister Trudy was mentally handicapped and spent most of her life in and out of mental institutions, as was commonplace in the time they were young. When Al was old enough to gain custody of her, he went back to the institution for her but found out that she had died of pneumonia. The anger in his voice when he asks, "How does a sixteen year old girl die from pneumonia in 1953?" says a lot about how heavily the topic weighs on him.

The team is investigating a terrorist who is violently against any and all genetic engineering, despite having been a prominent geneticist for decades. He lost his wife a few years ago, and they assume that's what radicalized him, but the timeline doesn't match up. When they catch him and interrogate him, he explains his wife's death had nothing to do with it; of course he was heartbroken, but he worked through it and moved on. What actually radicalized him was a genetic experiment he performed on flies. A minor mistake created a genetic disease that killed every single fly on campus in days. <em>That</em> is what convinced him that genetic engineering was too dangerous to continue, and the main characters can't really argue with his conclusion.

Both he and Joseph Jr. were dead older brothers to Bobby and Ted, and sadly, JFK, RFK, and Joe Jr. <strong>all</strong> were dead older brothers to Ted, the only one who lived a full life.
</li><li> JFK's two sons, Patrick (dead two days after his birth) and John Jr. (dead in a plane crash alongside his wife and sister-in-law) are dead younger brothers to his only surviving child, his daughter Caroline. Who also has a dead older sister in Arabella (a stillborn child).
</li><li> The Kennedy Family's involvement in the Special Olympics is inspired by (or perhaps penance for) the fate of JFK's sister Rosemary, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lobotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lobotomy">lobotomized</a> and then kept in an asylum for most of her life because Joseph Kennedy Sr. was flimflammed into thinking it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse">good way to deal</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousPrincess">a willful daughter</a> by celebrity lobotomist Walter Freeman.

</li><li> Akiyuki Nosaka, author of <em>Grave of the Fireflies</em>, wrote it as an apology to his little sister who died of malnutrition in war-torn Japan during WWII. Internet rumor has it that she didn't die of malnutrition and that he simply lost her one day and never saw her again. The book (and subsequent anime film) were ways of convincing himself of this. Japan's records of the time are terrible at best and it's most likely that the story was crossed with one of someone else.

He also became extremely paranoid, assuming at least five separate aliases, disguising his handwriting, and carrying concealed weapons at all times—where he had previously been known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGullible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGullible">the exact opposite</a>.

</li><li> Philip K. Dick's twin sister died when the two were only five weeks old. Being raised as a child with this knowledge (his mother allegedly claimed that the wrong child had died during an argument), the loss haunted PKD throughout his life. The figure of the mysterious, dark-haired and unattainable woman that is prominent in so many of his works (especially "Flow My Tears, the Police Said") is said to be based on PKD's imaginings of what his sister would have been like had she lived.

The distraction due to this contributed to his losses in this time. Unfortunately in 2007 a woman ended up confessing to her murder, though the Belforts didn't initially believe her (fearing rather the possibility of her covering for someone else). Nevertheless, it was only after this that his career turned around — and at his UFC 142: RIO, her face was on his team banner.

It's been suggested this knowledge deeply influenced him and his artwork. Whatever the case, he was a very unhappy person in adult life, and eventually killed himself.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1b6r7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1b6r7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1b6r7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although recent re-examination (circa 2011) of the evidence has brought the suicide angle under heavy dispute due to the nature of the wounds.</span>
