Japan comments that he envies Greece's vigor as he considers himself rather lacking in that department, and Greece responds that it's best if he learns how to enjoy it more. Cut to a shot of Japan's house from the outside, with Japan screaming so loudly that another country, China, yells at him to be quiet. Cut to Japan in bed, yelling about how relieved he was that it was all a dream... and Greece sleeping right next to him. And they're both naked.

Asuna starts getting undressed, but Kirito protests that he didn't mean it <em>that</em> way, to her irritation. Next scene, Asuna is seemingly nude under the blanket, and having a conversation with a fully-clothed Kirito sitting on the bed. In the original version of the novels, they did have sex there, but that scene (which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">hilariously</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKEAErotica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKEAErotica">horribly</a> written anyway) is not included in the published version of the novels, so take that as you will.

Peter's old flame Betty Brant has had a fight with her husband, she comes to Peter for comfort. They end up kissing. Cut, next panel is "several hours later" and Peter is feeling really guilty...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em>Siege at Blue Mountain</em> there's a scene where Leetah and Nightfall (both female) dance naked in the woods by night. It's never explicitly stated that they go any further, but given the elves' liberal attitude to sex it's far from unlikely.
</li><li> A later <em>Elf Quest</em> story has a variation. One of Skywise's three girlfriends(!) wants commitment and not just meaningless sex. At the end of the story she's considering whether to join in with the other three anyway, but the ending doesn't tell us what she decides.

The "They didn't" side isn't helped by the fact that that storyline was followed soon after by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a></em> — Where Rogue and Magneto had a child together.

<ul><li> One of Marvel's Berkley paperback novels (which, needless to say, are not part of regular continuity) added fuel to the fire. At the end of the <em>Gamma Quest Trilogy</em> (2000) by Greg Cox, Rogue reflects on her adventure with the Scarlet Witch, thinking how glad she is
<div class="indent"> [....] that she could finally bury the hatchet with one of Carol Danvers' closest friends. <em>Still</em>, she thought cautiously, <em>now is probably not the time to mention that fling I had with Wanda's daddy down in the Savage Land...!</em> (Italics in the original).
</div></li><li> Poor Rogue got this in an earlier issue as well — while depowered during the original Genosha storyline, there is a panel showing her at the mercy of several Genoshan guards. Even though Chris Claremont has loudly mentioned that nothing major happened, and even had Ms. Marvel explicitly say this in the next issue, many readers were still left with the impression that she was sexually assaulted or worse during her prison stay.

</li><li> Another <em>Superman</em> example, this time from the Iron Age.

At one point Gert alludes to the fact that she and Chase share a bed, but they are never shown doing more than kissing. Another time Nico and Victor are shown sitting in bed together—fully clothed. The dialogue makes it clear that <em>something</em> just happened between them without giving away any details. On the other hand, there was the time Chase joked that Gert's new codename should be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">"Power Vacuum"</a>.

Laura is in a similar state of undress, their clothes are scattered across the room, and some of the furniture is upended. Laura remembers very little of the night before, with Warren left to fill her in. However all the reader is shown is the pair getting into a fight with some punks while dancing at a club, and Warren telling her that was only the beginning as he flies away with her. Whether or not they slept together is never even discussed, as the conversation is focused mainly on Laura asking Warren why he likes her, and touching on how badly she needed a night away from the insanity of being an X-Man. The end of the issue leaves it ambiguous whether they did indeed have sex.

At one point Kitty even refers to it as "one night and a mistake", however by the end of the story Kitty reveals that the event of that night was actually Gambit stealing a sword that Kitty was keeping safe.

<ul><li> Subverted in the novel <em>Death and Diplomacy.</em> Benny and Jason get drunk and go to bed together; the narrator talks about how things are usually affable and casual the morning after a drunken hook-up because both parties subliminally know they fell asleep before anything serious could happen. In this case, however, those subliminals are featured using words like "repeated," "volcanic," and "multiple," so breakfast is tense and miserable.
</li><li> An example of the first variety occurs in the Eighth Doctor novel <em>The Taint</em>, although the reader knows exactly what went on — Sam got a little drunk and a whole lot concussed, and Fitz put her to bed, undressed her down to her underwear, and got in bed with her naked, and in the morning claimed they had wild, amazing sex and is very hurt that she doesn't even remember. Somehow, she eventually forgives him.
</li><li> In the epilogue of <em>The Dying Days</em>, Benny told the Eighth Doctor (whom she'd only just met) that before he left there was something she needed to do. Before he could ask what, she "grabbed the lapels of his frock coat, kissed him square on the mouth and pushed him down hard onto the bed" and...? There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">Shrug of God</a> in the author's notes, and that's probably as close as it's going to get with the Doctor.
<ul><li> In the Big Finish audio <em>The Company of Friends: Benny's Story</em> (technically a sequel to this), Benny narrates that "At the end of that [The Dying Days] he dropped me off back at my native time zone, and we...<em>ahem</em> shook hands, and said goodbye".

Maybe because they're <em>twelve years old</em>.
<ul><li> This one has a lot more problems than just the text itself. No other interpretation seems to make sense. Add to that the massive amounts of phallic and vaginal imagery throughout the books, the fact that now Will is an adult the only thing that breaks the knife is an image of Lyra instead of his mother... Likely the only reason Pullman won't confirm this is because he knows he would be crucified for their age (which is arguably closer to 14, but that's digressing).

But with Talia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">sudden departure</a>, it was never clearly resolved exactly how far things had gone.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, several of Sheridan and Delenn's off-screen encounters, particularly the 'problem solver' scene, fit into this category.

<ul><li> In Season 4's "Greg's Triangle", where he is clearly starry-eyed and gaga over Jennifer Nichols. It fits Example 4 — heavily implied intimacy, and it is never stated outright whether they did it. But the clues are there: Greg getting very close to Jennifer at the beach; Greg asking to bring Jennifer over to meet his folks; and Mike having a candid talk with Greg, cautioning him on whether she really is "the one."
</li><li> Season 5's "Getting Greg's Goat": All sorts of misunderstandings happen, and at one point several of the Bradys — at least Mike, and later Peter and Bobby — conclude that the fracas going on was Greg sleeping with a girl. Viewers were in the know all along: Greg was keeping the rival high school's goat in his room and was trying to keep it under wraps.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Giles and Joyce Summers</span> are implied to have sex in "Band Candy". It is confirmed in "Earshot".
</li><li> In the final episode of Season 7, on the night before the big showdown with the First Evil, Buffy and Spike spend the night together in Spike's corner of the basement, and they are seen cuddling in bed. However, the scene echoes an episode not long before in which they were cuddling in bed and it was explicitly stated that nothing else happened, so it's never clear whether they had sex or not. When asked, Joss Whedon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">refused to confirm or deny</a>.
</li><li> In a very late episode, a freshly introduced character is trying to get her head wrapped around the team's past relationships, and blurts out, "Have any of you <em>not</em> slept together?!" Xander and Spike (two male characters who nearly never interact except to bicker and snipe, but also spent several months living in a one-room basement apartment) look at each other... and the camera cuts away before they have a chance to speak up. The fandom goes crazy speculating. Joss does this a lot.
</li><li> For some time due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> Willow and Tara's relationship could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourGays">not be portrayed openly</a>, but it's implied that Willow and Tara shared either their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstKiss">First Kiss</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime">Their First Time</a> in "The I in Team". Buffy returns to her dorm the morning after she's slept with Riley for the first time, to find the dorm empty and the bed still made. Willow then enters, having spent the night "casting spells" with Tara. Willow is holding a crystal which she'd earlier rejected as a gift from Tara because it was a rare family heirloom, implying that she's now accepted it as a lover's token. The following episode has one of the more famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">spellcasting = lesbian love</a> conversations in reference to what happened the previous night.
</li><li> Faith got this a couple of times. When she tried to seduce Angel in "Enemies" Buffy fears they did do the deed, though it's later revealed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> spin-off that they didn't. Likewise in Season 7 there's a scene where Buffy catches Faith sharing a smoke with a shirtless Spike making audiences wonder if they slept together. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> in the comics when Faith gripes that she's meant to be a slut when everyone but her has slept with Spike.

When they finally did do it, they kept it between the two of them. When Sam tried to stand up for Rebecca later, by stating how good she was in bed (this <em>is</em> Sam we're talking about), none of the other regulars bought it... because they'd kept it to themselves (something totally counter to Sam's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> nature and, to be fair, prior actions).

Unless sex is a part of the character's immediate plot, two characters in a relationship are rarely confirmed to have sex. Often it's only confirmed much later if they did or didn't by a throwaway piece of dialog when sex is a part of the plot. Spinner having sex with Manny is only confirmed in Season 5 (when Spinner becomes a virgin again as part of Friendship Club), and Ellie's not having sex with Sean is confirmed in Season 6 (when she tells Ashley she's a virgin afraid to be seen as a kid with her older more experienced boyfriend).

On the first night they meet, Miriam and John end up spending the night in a hotel together after she ties one on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (nothing happens, except a <a class="urllink" href="http://outthere.keenspot.com/d/20060710.html">REALLY good dream<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)</span>.

Still later, Miriam wakes up on Araceli's couch and has trouble remembering what they did the night before, but she <a class="urllink" href="http://outthere.keenspot.com/d/20100325.html">figures it out on her own<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, confirming (in her own mind) that she doesn't have a drinking problem, after all.
</li><li> A retroactive version pops up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SequentialArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SequentialArt">Sequential Art</a></em>: It appeared that Pip and Hilary (Kat's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> rival) <a class="urllink" href="http://www.collectedcurios.com/sequentialart.php?s=782">ended up in bed together<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and subsequently forming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAccountingForTaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAccountingForTaste">a real bond.</a> Until later, when we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hilary has been slipping Pip "roofies", and staging the "morning afters" to get Pip to cover for her at work, while she looks for better employment.</span> Thus calling into question whether or not the first time was real or not.

<ul><li> In a "they did" example, Doug and Lindsay confirmed two years later that the fans were right when they thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaChick">The Nostalgia Chick</a> had sex twice (the hand-holding pregnancy-inducing scene and their fighting cut off by static and turning into happy dancing with different clothes) in their crossover review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FernGullyTheLastRainforest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FernGullyTheLastRainforest">FernGully: The Last Rainforest</a></em>.

In "Lost in Translation: Bromance Version", Donnie goes to an anime con and meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UncleYo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UncleYo">Uncle Yo</a>. The two of them hit it off and go back up to Donnie's apartment and we get several scenes of them both drinking and steadily losing outer items of clothing. Later on, Donnie goes back out to the con and meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Egoraptor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Egoraptor">Egoraptor</a>, and something similar happens, followed by Uncle Yo discovering them and acting basically like a jilted lover.
</li><li> In "The Blair Witch Hangover", Rebecca and Tacoma wake up after a night of heavy drinking, Rebecca looking rumpled and flopped on top of Tacoma and Tacoma in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedIntoDrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedIntoDrag">princess dress</a>. They spend the rest of the episode trying to figure out what happened, and while the question is coyly stepped around, the two had plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> before and after.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CriticalRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CriticalRole">Critical Role</a>: In Episodes 42 and 64 Vax and Keyleth respectively call at the other's door at night saying they don't want to spend the night alone, and are let in. That's all we ever see. It's certainly implied they had sex, but we may never know for sure. And as of Episode 65 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Keyleth tells Vax that she's finally ready to love him,</span> it doesn't really matter anyway.
