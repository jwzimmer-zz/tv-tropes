</p><p>A Noble Demon is a villainous character with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour">Code of Honour</a>. He doesn't care that he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">bad image</a> — he may even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">actively cultivate and embrace it.</a> However, every so often a situation presents itself and he's just not willing to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">the extra mile necessary</a> to be <em>completely</em> evil. He'll topple your castle, but he'll do it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverHurtAnInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverHurtAnInnocent">right after everyone has cleared out first</a>. He'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">sacrifice whole armies</a> to achieve his goal but he'll also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrifice himself</a> if he must. He'll conquer your village but he won't cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">more destruction than necessary</a>. He wants to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> but he won't stab an enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">In the Back</a>. His ambition might be to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, or merely to uphold the evil side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Good and Evil</a>.
</p><p>Some will be obsessed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasJustPassingThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasJustPassingThrough">explaining this behavior</a> so people won't think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">he's gone soft</a>.

Alternately, their nobility often gives them an opportunity to demonstrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValour">Villainous Valour</a> in the face of the hero's successes. And while Noble Demons are generally far from nice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">being noble</a> and powerful seems to imply they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">above petty and malicious acts</a>, or at least uninterested in them.
</p><p>A Noble Demon who's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> often comments that his enemies are (or have become) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">petty and cowardly and stain the name of their species</a>. Likewise, when other villains show their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">true colors under pressure</a>, the Noble Demon is likely to show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousValour">Villainous Valour</a>.
</p><p>Often experiences <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheDevil">Sympathy for the Devil</a> from the heroes, and may perhaps show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheHero">Sympathy for the Hero</a> right back. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">Eviler Than Thou</a> comes up, the Noble Demon will likely be on the less evil end. May also be the "grayer" character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfGrey">A Lighter Shade of Grey</a>.

</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil">Ambiguously Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a>.

Also contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">Faux Affably Evil</a>, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithTheHeartOfAJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithTheHeartOfAJerk">kind acts only serve to benefit him</a> (though milder examples of this may still qualify). Villains lacking this trait will usually be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>. Compare and contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero">Nominal Hero</a>, a character who does heroic deeds for all the wrong reasons.
</p><p>None of these examples are of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> variety, as both their actions <em>and</em> means are purely evil and have no code of honor to abide to.

She genuinely loves her daughter, Urd (though that won't stop her from beating the crap out of Urd if Urd stands in her way), and is distinctly less evil than many in Niflheim, evidenced when those more evil revolted against her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has plenty of this, as the Straw Hats and the Whitebeard Pirates are the <em>very rare</em> pirate crews that don't hurt anyone and help others. Many others will acknowledge their selfish goals as pirates but will stop short of excessive killing and violence. Meanwhile, whilst many Marines are heroic characters who are only antagonists to the Straw Hats through their duty to fight piracy, some actively further the undoubtedly evil goals of the World Government and sympathise with some of its aims. They will then often be horrified at the immoral means the World Government goes to to protect its interests, and see protecting civilians as more important than the World Government's abstract and self-serving philosophy of 'Justice'. Some prominent examples include:
<ul><li> Smoker is basically Luffy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> and shows no mercy whatsoever to pirates, no matter how honourable their goals. He also stops every now and then to help his subordinates and prevent civilians from getting hurt in the crossfire. He also grudgingly acknowledges Luffy commanding Zoro to rescue him when an underground tunnel is flooded with water (leaving him powerless due to his Devil Fruit), and gives the Straw Hats a headstart in escaping.
</li><li> Aokiji was horrified at Akainu's massacre of the Oharan civilians, even though he had a point, and later on <em>left the Marines</em> where it meant either serving under him and taking part in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> deeds, or being a silent spectator in a lower rank.
</li><li> Sengoku, the honorary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the first part definitely counts, as he would rather leave his prestigious position as Fleet Admiral, than see the cover up of history's worst criminals just to save face.
</li><li> The New World captains who come to the aid of Whitebeard during the Summit War. All of them are known for their terrifying infamy as pirates, but honour their debts to Whitebeard and come to his aid when Ace is threatened with execution.
</li><li> Shanks. He is the series' first introduced example of a 'real' pirate, and his crew kill a bunch of bandits in the early chapters to establish that they aren't joking around. Shanks, however, is a deeply honourable figure. When Kaido, one of the Four Emperors alongside Shanks, Big Mom, and Whitebeard, attempts to take advantage of Whitebeard being distracted by Ace's pending execution to attack him, Shanks intervenes on Whitebeard's behalf and stops Kaido, then shows up to stop the war after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Whitebeard's death</span> to prevent any further pointless bloodshed.
</li><li> Some members of CP9, more prominently Lucci and Kaku. Despite being cold-blooded killers, they originally honored Robin's request to spare the Straw Hats, only fighting them because of a favorable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. Lucci is more of an honorable warrior, not going after Robin even after Luffy was distracted, and showing disgust of Spandam's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> treatment of Robin and the Buster Call, while Kaku straight up admitted he liked being a Galley-La shipwright, and gracefully handed Zoro his key leading to Robin's freedom. It is because of this that the CP9 basically got a Redemption Arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and then Lucci and Kaku getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankUp">Rank Up</a></span>, where Spandam faced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> and being a subordinate to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lucci and Kaku, whom he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftForDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftForDead">Left for Dead</a></span>.
</li><li> Trafalgar Law. Being one of the series' most ruthless pirates, he nonetheless showed disgust at the slave auction, with him gracefully recruiting Jean Bart, a former slave, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with him saving Luffy at the tail-end of the Marineford War, when all hope seemed lost</span>, and betraying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Caesar the moment he realized the kids are being used for fatal experiments</span>, and all his actions post Punk Hazard being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an elaborate revenge for his <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherFigure">Big Brother Figure</a>'s murder 13 years ago</span>.

<ul><li> Durbe of the Barian Emperors might be the original embodiment of this trope. While he showed in the battle of Saragasso that he will use any means to win, even using a dirty trick (which was part of Vector's plan), he only does so because of his noble intention in saving the Barian World, no matter the cost. He is also known to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainRespect">praise his opponents</a> for their skills as he did with Shark (before knowing his true identity) and Droite (in the final battle on Earth). He puts an end to any unnecessary fights between the emperors, and trusts them and acknowledges their skills. Even his Chaos Number is named after this trope. His noble soul is shown the most during his final duel with Merag against Vector, Where he sacrificed himself to ensure Merag's victory on the traitor. Might also overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured">Wicked Cultured</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>.

<ul><li> Hiei fits this trope to a T. Not only is he a demon, but he keeps insisting that he's bad to the bone and cares about nobody, but his actions keep on betraying him. By the end of the series, he's loosened up enough that he actually admits to having friends and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he gets emotionally close to a female demon with a past even more ghastly than his</span>.
</li><li> Yoko Kurama also plays this straight. He was once a sociopathic and ruthless thief, but by the time that he first appears in the series (midway through the Dark Tournament arc), he has since abandoned that for the most part. While it was feared that Kurama would pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> once he transforms, his former demon self is shown to be more than willing in helping his human half and Team Urameshi.

He always keeps his promises, treats people below his station and even his enemies with respect (even when they're really annoying), and is one of the few Roman politicians we see who isn't plotting to backstab everyone else, stealing money from the state, being completely ineffectual, or fantasizing about getting the Gaulish magic potion and using it to kill their friends and become god-emperor. It should be noted that in no way is he a nice guy, though; he's still a colonialist tyrant who tries to have people executed, is delighted by various Villain of the Week characters with bizarre and horrible gifts, and is trying to destroy a culture's way of life simply because they're getting on his nerves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin">The Kingpin</a>, archenemy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>. He's an unabashed crime lord who will ruthlessly eliminate people who hinder his operation. However he almost always keeps his promises, has a fairly strict code of honor, genuinely cares for his friends and family, and treats his underlings well as long as they pull their weight and don't try to backstab him. He actually has a fair amount of respect for Daredevil, if only because Matt so strongly adheres to his convictions. In this regard Kingpin is often contrasted with Daredevil's other archenemy Bullseye, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> who commits evil for the fun of it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a> may be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">King of Terror</a>, but he will <em>not</em> harm children (and in fact he likes them), has little tolerance for human traffickers and drug smugglers and <em>zero</em> tolerance for rapists and biological weapons, tries to avoid collateral damage (not that he cares when he has to cause it), respects those who give him a run for his money, and will <em>always</em> keep his word.
</li><li> Another literal example was the Straw Man, a scarecrow-like demon and one of the Fear Lords: a group of demons who could feed on fear and conspired to conquer and rule the Earth. (The most notorious of them was Nightmare.) The Straw Man eventually double-crossed the others, aiding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> to oppose Nightmare. (The reason behind this shift in allegiance isn't known, but it may have been part of its stated goal of taking vengeance upon a group called the Cult of Kalumai.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, this is either played straight or occasionally subverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a>. In the latter, he acts like he has a sense of honor, but will do anything to achieve his goals, up to and including sacrificing a woman who loved him to a demon. In the former, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">Doom is a man of his word</a>, and keeps his promises, <em>even to his enemies</em>. For example, when talking with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> after the latter has assisted Doom in dealing with an assassination attempt, he told Spider-Man that he would repay him for saving his life one day, and when he rejected the offer, Doom stated that he immediately repaid the debt by <em>not</em> killing him for his ingratitude. It is not surprising then that he does make few promises, or that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">very carefully words</a> those promises which he does make.
</li><li> This could be said of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Rogues</a> because they have a code of "ethics" that they live by and consider themselves above killing women and children. Captain Cold is a particular stand out in this regard. This is also the reason they generally keep to themselves and don't work with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">the Secret Society</a>; they're so stubborn and honor-bound that more amoral villains like Lex Luthor can't manipulate them, and instead alienate them by proposing schemes that none of the Rogues can stomach.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em>'s succubus Chantinelle (Ellie) is less noble than extraordinarily unlucky. Having tried to seduce an angel and succeeded, she fell in love with him and bore his child, leading to his demise at the hands of other angels and her exile from Hell. John Constantine notes that she's not a bad sort considering what she actually is, to which she replies, "I don't think so, John...I think I'm just polite."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iznogoud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iznogoud">Iznogoud</a></em>: Sultan Pullmankar is mostly known as a ruthless conqueror and a terrifying enemy, but he has a lot of rules (including always sparing his enemy's generals), is very affable to the Caliph when they are allied, and is shown to be a pretty good father.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> may very well define this category, at least when he's on the Heel side of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">HeelFace Revolving Door</a>. He only wants to protect his people and sees a war between mutants and humans as inevitable so he wants to strike first. He may even have a point or two about this, he just can't resist going several steps too far.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> often writes to this trope. Denizens from Hell can often be bargained with (after all, being a demon is all about lying, backstabbing, betrayal, and personal gain) or reasoned with, and frequently have a code of honor by which they will abide, to the extent of helping out a protagonist. Lucifer in the earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSandman">Sandman</a> arcs is particularly representative of this trope.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix">Secret Six</a> sometimes fall into this, though it's usually more a case of punishing the evil (with torture) than saving the good. One of the best examples is Deadshot's revenge mission to a North Korean political prison.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> consists of a few.
<ul><li> A literal example is Demogoblin, who was created due to a curse placed on the second Hobgoblin, who had previously made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>. Through most of his career, the Demogoblin acted like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">Sinister Minister</a>, killing people who he believed were sinners, which usually included many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander">Innocent Bystanders</a>. <em>However</em>, in a battle with the actual Hobgoblin, he made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save an innocent child who the Hobgoblin had deliberately put in harm's way, dying in the process. This made Spider-Man more disgusted with the Hobgoblin than he ever had been; in the end, the demon who his wickedness had spawned had been nobler than he had been.
</li><li> The Sandman is often portrayed as rather heroic despite being a villain. He has a moral code and is not above teaming up with Spider-Man if the situation requires it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a>. He may be a violent psychopath determined to destroy Spider-Man and anyone who gets in the way of that goal, but he always tries to avoid hurting innocents and tends to go out of his way to protect them. This is because, in Brock's delusional mind, he's the hero of the people and Spider-Man is the monster that New York needs to be saved from.
</li></ul></li><li> Namor the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner">Sub-Mariner</a> retains his nobility the times he passes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelRevolvingDoor">FaceHeel Revolving Door</a> between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>. He's fully smitten with Sue, but respects her choice and seeks to legitimately win her heart.
</li><li> This is the common characterization for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a> the Mad Titan of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityGauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityGauntlet">The Infinity Gauntlet</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarlordOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarlordOfMars">Warlord of Mars</a></em>, Joshua Clark differs from many previous villains, that while a ruthless man driven by revenge, he has a wicked sense of honor; he is willing to show mercy to Dejah if she tells where is her husband, and not once tries to force himself on her. While he orders her execution when she attempts to escape and is unwilling to comply, he clearly laments being forced to do so. In the final duel between him an Carter, he declares that if Carter wins, then Clark's armada will abandon Barsoom's conquest and leave their world alone.
</li><li> Princess Lucinda from the reboot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WitchGirlsTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WitchGirlsTales">Witch Girls Tales</a></em>, <strong>so</strong> much. She has quite a sadistic side and a reputation as an evil princess... but for all her loudly-proclaimed villainy, she almost <em>always</em> seems to end up on the side of good, despite her rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>-riffic methods — even by the standards of the setting, which is loaded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> transformations and remarkably casual murder. It's actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a></em> in one side comic, where it's noticed that unicorns will approach her, despite supposedly being amazing judges of character that never approach anyone evil. When someone suggests that this means she's just <em>acting</em> evil, she turns them into a frog for it.

In fact, multiple times he will come to the defense of a helpless neutral party.

</li><li> Mr. White in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em>, who coolly and emotionlessly kills police officers and is willing to kill innocent civilians if it will help him, but expresses disgust at the psychopathic excesses of Mr. Blonde and treats the terminally wounded Mr. Orange with almost paternal care.

<ul><li> Also, the Knights of Takhisis, who modeled themselves after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">Knights of Solamnia</a>.

<ul><li> In fact this trope was deliberately invoked in-universe. Age after age, the forces of evil would attempt to conquer the world, get most of the way there, determine that victory was inevitable, then start to turn on each other as each petty evil overlord tried to come out on top of the others when the dust settled, which gave the heroes the chance to regroup and turn things around. Takhisis was sick and tired of this, so she discarded the majority of her forces, all the hordes of monsters and minor tyrants, in order to found a knightly order who would follow a strict code of conduct and honor. They were much less powerful overall than her previous armies, but their unity and integrity made them much more dangerous than the less discriminate monsters of the past.

In reality, he is as ruthless, pragmatic and evil as any Red Court vampire and just puts on the act for political advantages, as shown when tries to force Harry to lose the duel by continuing to threaten his loved ones and pulls out a gun when things don't go his way.

<ul><li> Aziraphale actively works against Heaven's plan to bring about armageddon just as resolutely as Crowley works against Hell's. The story implies that the actual differences between the two afterlives aren't as big as advertised and that God isn't actually actively on either side.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>: there are quite a few theoretically villainous or antagonistic characters that act rather decently, at least to some people. These include Jaime Lannister, Sandor Clegane, Jaquen H'Gar, and Petyr Baelish, all of whom have acted decently towards protagonist characters when they didn't have to. Then again, the series tries to show all of its characters as three-dimensional and well-developed.
<ul><li> Your mileage may <em>definitely</em> vary on Petyr Baelish; the only character he's kind to is Sansa, and that's only when he's not sexually harassing her. His nobler moments come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> to some. This is the problem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">Petyr</a>... you're never quite sure when he's donning any particular behaviour pattern (including this one) as a mask, even as a reader: heaven help the characters he interacts with.
</li><li> Jaime Lannister is probably the best example; his biggest evil act was the murder of King Aerys after swearing to protect him, but what most characters don't know (or conveniently forget) is that Aerys was a crazy son of a bitch, who, if he had lived just half an hour longer, would have ordered his capital city burned to the ground with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire">wildfire</a>, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians as well as the enemy. Jaime himself laments that he's loved by one for a kindness he never did, and reviled by thousands for his finest act—though, despite a sympathetic PoV and some heavy-duty character development, he remained pretty unrepentantly demonic until <em>A Storm of Swords</em>.
<ul><li> He also threw the young son of his host out of one of the higher windows of a castle, permanently crippling him. He becomes much more sympathetic when (two books later) we realise that he did it for the great love of his life (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">not a nice lady herself</a>), that he had intended the child to be killed instantly, and that he is deeply remorseful for it, considering it his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>. By the time his PoV comes up, he has a <em>humongous</em> pile of other things (many immediately dangerous) to worry about... so, it's not looked at again in any great depth due to having been put in the stockpot of "miscellaneous things to guilt about in aggregate at 3 am, but which I don't usually have time for" he has constantly on the backburner.

<ul><li> For a Sith Lord, Darth Plagueis surprisingly fits this trope. For one thing, when Plagueis takes Palpatine under his wing, he makes it very clear that, although he is going to make Palpatine's training a living hell, he will not attempt to continue with Darth Bane's legacy of backstabbing, and intended to share everything he knew to Sidious expecting that he'd do so in return. Unfortunately, Sidious still managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">continue the legacy</a>.
</li><li> In his appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a></em>, Thrawn comes off this way. He's cold and fairly callous and calculating, but he's also <em>fair</em> - when he thinks another character is responsible for the deaths of some of his men, he tries to find out the facts, and as soon as he's sure they didn't do it, he lets them go. He's also the only character in this series to really acknowledge that the protagonists are <em>children</em> - when Tash is rude, he crisply informs her that since she's a child, he won't take offense.

His justice is just much more direct and no-nonsense. The "evil" in him comes from the fact that he believes order, no matter how it is achieved, is preferable to chaos; so he'll work for a genocidal xenophobic totalitarian faction like the Galactic Empire because he genuinely believes it's better than the alternative of chaos across the galaxy without a unifying power. But he has standards and acts on them frequently, refusing jobs that do not meet his exacting standard of justice or outright refusing to do things that he considers wrong, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like sniping the clone of Starkiller when he was distracted kissing Juno Eclipse</span>.

</div></li><li> Remember the last temptation of Christ? Another show-only flashback tell us that it was Crowley that did it, and even then he hadn't intended it as a temptation, he just thought Jesus was a "bright young lad" who deserved to see the world.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Crowley:</strong> Well he's a carpenter from Galilee, his traveling opportunities are limited.
</div></li><li> Similarly in the book, Aziraphale is also a mild inversion of the Noble Demon, being genuinely committed to being good and believing in those values, while having decidedly <em>un</em>-angelic traits such as materialism, pettiness, and going on drinking binges with a demon. And just like show!Crowley, show!Aziraphale is also some shades different to his book original in that he's just a little less petty and a bit more uptight about (trying) to follow heaven's orders. He still ends up choosing humanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext">and Crowley</a> over his designated allegiance, recognizing that heaven really has no idea what it's doing regarding God's actual Plan.

However, the series introduces several Imagin who don't know their original goal or simply don't care for it; all of these Imagin end up as good guys. The singular best example is Kintaros, whose partner wished to become stronger. While most Imagin would beat up anybody stronger than their partner, Kintaros possessed the young man's body and underwent physical training using his extreme strength. Throughout the entire ordeal, Kintaros displays exceptional honor, courage, and compassion, and it's no surprise he ends up partnered with Den-O by the end of the two-parter.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em> we have Morgause. When trying to kill the king of Camelot (a dude who drowns children) she puts everyone who might try to fight her immortal soldiers under a sleeping spell. While considered the villain, she actually doesn't do much of anything that is really evil and has a lower body count than the heroes. Ultimately Subverted, as the next season shows she'll happily murder innocents, engage in slavery, backstab her own lover and is responsible for corrupting Morganna.

It eventually turns out that his honorable side was an artifact of his previous heroic personality before he was turned evil by a magic spell.
<ul><li> Zen-Aku in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Power Rangers Wild Force</a></em> also has shades of this, although it's implied to be mostly a result of having fused with Merrick. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even after they're separated and he's defeated a second time, he somehow survives and decides to accompany Merrick on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">seeking atonement.</a> </span>

Not wanting to lie, he says that yes, he was directly responsible for the deaths of over three thousand people, many of whom he had killed with his bare claws...ed hands. "In fact, sixty of them were here in this city. Why do you ask, officer?" Attempting to arrest him, he defends himself by resuming his demonic form right there in the interrogation room. After the frightened cops drop 30 bullets into him without much effect, he apologizes and resumes his human form. The demon is then sentenced to one thousand years in prison, a sentence set to commensurate with the demon's extraordinary life span.

There were even cases of Khorne sending his daemons after servants who had offered him the skulls of noncombatants or other equally "unworthy" opponents. While this is no longer true of the vast majority of his servants, Khorne himself is still usually portrayed as honorable, and he refuses to allow his servants to use psychic abilities as they would be unfair. He is generally suspicious of Tzeentch, the god of sorcery and secrets, for the same reason.

He is a thief, who trains others to be thieves, and works with Bill Sykes, but deep down he doesn't like his life and wishes the things he does weren't necessary, and tries his best not to be too bad.

I'm reviewing the situation; can a fellow be a villain all his life?... I'm a bad 'un and a bad 'un I shall stay. You'll be seeing no transformation, but it's wrong to be a rogue in every way. I don't want nobody hurt for me or made to do the dirt for me, this rotten life is not for me, it's getting far too hot for me, there is no in-between for me, but who will change the scene for me?

<ul><li> Thundercracker in almost every continuity. He expresses disgust towards Decepticons who kill innocents because "the Decepticons are forged through combat, not slaughter". In at least one continuity he abandoned the Decepticon military and became a neutral civilian after Megatron attempted to use a nuke on a civilian population just to kill Optimus Prime and his team.
</li><li> Cyclonus. He's brutal in combat and serves the Decepticons willingly, but avoids unneeded cruelty and holds a strong code of honor. In the IDW continuity, he refuses to feel bad about actions committed during his time in the war, but strives to be a good person and is driven by a desire to return Cybertron to its golden age.
</li><li> Soundwave in most continuities is undyingly loyal to Megatron and ultimately wanting peace and equality. He also tries to avoid violence that he considers unnecessary. The IDW comics highlighted this the most, with Soundwave attempting to start up a peaceful Decepticon commune on Jupiter after the Great War ends.
</li><li> Thunderwing in the original comic series. He's most famous as being the only Decepticon leader to gain the position through a fair election.
</li><li> Sixshot, a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> who will ruthlessly carry out missions, but who has a strong code of honor and refuses to harm children.

In another he grappled with severe depression and remorse over his actions in the war, feeling like he had let himself be used as a weapon by evil people.
</li><li> Krok, at least in the IDW continuity, where he's ruthless in combat but reasonable and polite off the battlefield. He also bears no true hatred towards his enemies, as he's come to realize that there aren't as many differences between the Autobots and Decepticons as most think.
</li><li> Deathsaurus, well-known as one of the noblest Decepticon leaders. Not only does he try to avoid unneeded cruelty and have a soft spot for children, but he's very polite towards soldiers under his command, treating them with respect as long as they pull their weight. He's also motivated partly out of a desire to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">provide for his wife Esmeral</a> and holds respect towards his archenemy Star Saber.

Multiple times he has a clear opportunity to coerce Aang by threatening either bystanders or captured prisoners, but he never does. During their first fight, he clearly sees that Aang will surrender instantly to protect innocent bystanders, but never exploits this, and keeps his word to leave the village in peace if Aang surrenders. When he has Katara prisoner, he tries to bargain with her and appeal to her better nature rather than threaten or coerce her, and he forces pirates to help him capture Aang rather than use Katara as bait. Likewise, when he has Katara and Sokka prisoner, he still insists on fighting Aang one on one rather than try to use them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This eventually turns into a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.</span>

It also helps that he's the only one of the rogue's gallery to <em>not</em> be insane, thus his crimes all center around monetary gain rather than revenge or just sheer insanity and tend to cause much less collateral damage.
</li><li> Despite considering himself an official villain, Puma Loco from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElTigreTheAdventuresOfMannyRivera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElTigreTheAdventuresOfMannyRivera">El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera</a></em> puts his family in first place than his criminal schemes most of the time, and is often seen helping his grandson Manny and his son White Pantera in beating up the other criminals of Miracle City.

Notably, Macbeth only attacked Goliath's clan in his introductory episode because he thought they were Demona's allies. In all subsequent episodes, he refuses to harm anyone outside of his feud with Demona.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">He-Man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower">She-Ra</a> Christmas Special, Skeletor gradually falls under the influence of the Christmas spirit, causing him to become this for a time. He does not enjoy the experience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ultra-Humanite is quite morally ambiguous for a villain. While he does a series of serious crimes, like blowing up a modern art museum because he despises Modernism, he also tends to help the heroes in certain occasions. A particular example is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> where he helps the Flash giving a desired toy to a group of orphans.
</li><li> Oddly enough, both of those plots are from the same episode! Ultra-Humanite waited until Christmas because he knew the museum would be empty, thus making for exactly zero casualties. In the ensuing fight with Flash, they accidentally smash the toy, and Humanite helps to repair and deliver it. He sums it up best when he points out he not only repaired it but improved it as well (it now tells stories instead of trashily rapping) and Flash asks if it's going to explode:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Ultra-Humanite:</strong> Flash, <em>please</em>. It is Christmas.
</div></li><li> Earlier, in his introduction episode, (which is really Batman playing on all of the Injustice Gang) Batman is forced to trying to offer Ultra-Humanite double whatever Luthor was paying. Humanite counters by revealing he's not being paid but is in it because he cannot stand the lack of culture in modern society. Batman counters by offering to donate enough money to his favorite opera program on PBS to upgrade him from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersLikeYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersLikeYou">Viewers Like You</a> to a named donor... and he'd put in a good word to the prison to get Humanite a TV to watch that. Humanite's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> is what stops Luthor's plan once and for all.
</li><li> Though more overtly evil than Humanite, Atomic Skull has a clearly much stronger moral code than his fellow Legion of Doom members. He rarely commits crimes on his own and typically operates as an enforcer for other criminals or participates in Meta-Brawl which, while illegal, is merely an underground fighting ring where people gamble on battles between willing metahuman combatants. He's also much more strongly in favor of allying with the Justice League to save the world than most of his allies, stating "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion">Hey it's our world too!</a>" and even risked his own skin to save Hawkgirl's life by carrying her unconscious body clear of an explosion.
</li></ul></li><li> Gene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a></em>. Despite technically being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, he puts himself and his (cough) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">business</a></em> at considerable risk to save a girl when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> could not (she's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>, not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> that could be useful to him, just a friend).
</li><li> Nightmare Moon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide">Drunk on the Dark Side</a> doesn't seem to want to harm her subjects. Compare how she merely tried to block and distract the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Mane 6</a> to how she actively tried to <em>kill</em> Princess Celestia. This is explored a bit further in the Season 5 finale where, as opposed to the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Futures</a> that are war-torn ruins or outright post-apocalyptic events, the future under her rule is merely dark, unpleasant, and gloomy. Nightmare also seems to be surrounded by loyal followers, while most of the other villains either act solo in their Bad Futures or had to brainwash followers, implying that while things under Nightmare Moon might be different and arguably worse than under Celestia, they're not necessarily <em>bad</em> and some might even prefer her rule.
<ul><li> Discord seems largely unwilling to kill or hurt ponies, at least physically. (He's fine with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>, until his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> is usually cited as an explanation; dead ponies just aren't fun to play with.
</li><li> The sphinx from "Daring Done" is willing to strong-arm (paw?) food out of the ponies to the point they're starving, and she <em>is</em> willing to cheat by demanding a second chance, but when she's beaten at her own game she stays true to her terms and leaves. Considering she's about 200X the ponies size, apparently able to warp reality to a degree and capable of breathing fire, there was nothing stopping her from just eating Somnambula and continuing her reign of terror when she was "defeated".
</li></ul></li><li> Brain from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a>, but if the push comes to shove, he'll choose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">taking over the world</a>: he <em>did</em> take over the world in one of the Christmas episodes thanks to toy bears that hypnotized people, but when he realized how badly he had alienated Pinky and crossed a line he shouldn't have, his only order was for everyone to just have a happy Christmas and be with people they cared about; another episode had Pinky sell his soul to Satan to give Brain world domination, but Brain eventually decided that if he couldn't rule with Pinky by his side, he wouldn't rule at all.
<ul><li> Whenever the world is in danger from some other threat, Brain will do whatever he can to save the world. ("So it is available to take over tomorrow night.")
</li></ul></li><li> Alvin from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SabrinaTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SabrinaTheAnimatedSeries">Sabrina: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Planet of the Dogs". He starts off as a normal dog, but when Sabrina neglects him, he gains the ability to speak from the Spooky Jar and becomes the leader of a gang of mistreated dogs. Also, he kidnaps Sabrina's family but never puts them in mortal danger.
</li><li> Captain Skyhook from <em>The Space Kidettes</em> is a pathological Noble Demon. His evil minion, Static, enthusiastically suggests all sorts of gruesome villainy be done to the Kidettes, only to be chastised by Skyhook, who replies that "They're just itsy bitsy, teeny weeny little kids!", and promptly bashes Static's helmet in.
</li><li> Red X from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, so very, very much. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">talented thief</a> using a powered suit that he stole from Robin to commit crimes, and he outright tells Robin that he <em>likes</em> being a criminal. On the other hand, whenever Red X shows up, he inevitably ends up doing <em>something</em> good in spite of himself, up to and including making enemies out of nine other supervillains to ensure Robin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">wins a race</a>.
</li><li> Duncan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> becomes this when he plays the villainous role, though he's usually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> delinquent who loves to push people's buttons, but usually he's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">playing up his bad-boy reputation</a> so he doesn't seem "soft".
</li><li> Cyclonus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em> occasionally had elements of this. Sixshot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersHeadmasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersHeadmasters">Transformers: The★Headmasters</a></em> suddenly became one towards the end of the series so he could do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.
