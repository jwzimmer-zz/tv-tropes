What you see and perceive is real. Sometimes characters are betrayed, but the player never is."</em>
</p><p>The above quote from Ken Levine to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-greatest-games-of-all-time-system-shock-2/1100-6130956/">GameSpot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> describes the standard relationship between a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">Video Game</a> and said game's players. Games won't deceive you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsNeverLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsNeverLie">Villains Never Lie</a> (or if they do, it is obvious) and you're the one pulling the strings. Characters' expectations will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">subverted</a> but <em>yours</em> will not be. As such, the common relationship between the player and the game constitutes a trope. Therefore, it can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">played with</a>.
</p><p>Playing The Player is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">Video Game</a> plot device that occurs when this common relationship is played with in a manner <em>designed to make the player uncomfortable</em>.
</p><p>There are quite a few ways to do this. Most involve deliberate deception of the player (not just the player character). But it has to be a significant betrayal of the player's expectations in order to qualify, and this betrayal must be intended to make the player squirm. And this is not the only manner in which a game can do this. By definition, the game has to have a level of understanding about how players relate to it in order to pull this off.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>One example of an expectation gamers have is that achieving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, if it does anything, will make the ending happier, or at least clarify it in some way, to reward the player for going deeper into the game. Thus, a game can play with that expectation by offering up a <em>worse</em> ending or by adding something that turns a previously understandable series of events into one big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">admonishing the player</a> (either by proxy or by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a>) for thinking all that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">grinding</a> would matter.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">"Seinfeld" Is Unfunny</a> also applies to this trope. To someone that has played, for instance, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> does not seem to betray the player in a shocking way. Of course, to someone that has spent their time with only the earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games and no other games, <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> would come as quite a shock. In short, it partly behaves like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaTwist">Meta Twist</a> and depends significantly on a player's initial expectations. Arguably, as the "standard" (i.e. expected) relationship between a player and a game changes, there will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingTrope">evolution</a> in what a game has to do to qualify for this trope.

Additionally, this is not the same as having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">No Fourth Wall</a>. Also, this trope often deals with plot details, so spoilers ahead.

This seems to be the case at the start of the game, but as time goes on, the hero's appearance begins changing, becoming ragged and dark, and some of the monsters you defeat seem benign and even peaceful. Some won't even attack unless provoked. The player must confront their feelings of the morality of continuing to play the game. The big turning point comes after killing Phalanx (#13), a <em>truly</em> majestic creature that never once tries to attack the player.

Some of the later bosses beg you not to continue (their opposition is based on self-defense since the success of your quest is tied to the end of their existence).

Thus, he pulls Nate into helping him find a major treasure with leads to conflict with fellow treasure hunter Rafe. The entire fifth level is Sam telling of his escape as the player goes through a wild gun battle filled adventure before getting out. Held by Rafe at gunpoint, Nate tells him that they're willing to help in exchange for a cut of the treasure to get Sam out of Alcazar's grasp. Rafe's reply: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">"Whoa, What the hell are you talking about, Nate?

It turns out there was no huge "breakout," Rafe just bribed the warden to let Sam walk right out of jail. Sam then spent two years helping Rafe with the treasure hunt only to double-cross him and trick Nate into helping out. In other words, the game had an entire level for an event that never even happened.</span>

As an ARG, it presented itself as part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, sending the player phone calls, emails, instant messages, and faxes (why yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">it was 2001</a>) with clues to solve the mystery. The game began with the player receiving news that the developers had been killed, and it only got worse from there. Since the game was based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheory">Conspiracy Theory</a> material (specifically, the Majestic-12), the player being constantly lied to makes sense. Many of the people that played the game reported being rendered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">completely paranoid</a> during the time they played it, and indeed, <a class="urllink" href="http://forums.ukcs.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=38035&amp;start=0">"messing with the guy that plays 'Majestic'"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> became an office hobby during the brief time the game was operating. Unfortunately, it suffered from absolutely dreadful timing — it launched only a month and a half before 9/11, and due to both its subject matter and its use of the phone network, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> temporarily suspended it, later canceling it outright in April of 2002.
</li><li> Years later, a game called <em><a class="urllink" href="http://kotaku.com/the-fake-terrorist-conspiracy-game-that-fooled-people-f-1710418998">ALFA-ARKIV<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> or, alternatively, <em>Junko Junsui</em> did something similar, and wound up being so effective that some of the material from the game was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/junko-junsui-and-alfa-arkiv-behind-the-curtain/">logged in intelligence databases<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the game's characters mistaken for actual terrorists. Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorists</a> also thought that the game was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1023320/pg1">a Russian psy-op<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Haze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Haze">Haze</a></em> attempted to play this trope straight. The game has you as a trooper for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">the Mantel Corporation</a>, jacked up on a performance-enhancing supplement called "Nectar" and fighting a guerrilla-terrorist army led by a madman that wears human skin.

Not a bad idea, but the execution was lacking, and it didn't help that the gameplay doesn't hold up terribly well.

Throughout the game, you constantly see and interact with Reznov, one of the main characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyWorldAtWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyWorldAtWar">Call of Duty: World at War</a></em>, as he encourages Mason to take out the three main villains at any cost. The player, who can only see what Mason observes, unless they are playing as Hudson, simply take Reznov's word for it, like Mason. However, there are subtle hints throughout the game that not all is as it appears, as no one else, minus the interrogator, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is Hudson,</span> even acknowledges Reznov's presence. One even asks what is wrong with you. As it turns out in the big reveal, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Reznov was never by your side. He had instead hijacked a brainwashing attempt on you in order to take revenge on the three main villains, hence his constant quote, "Dragovich, Kravchenko, Steiner. All must die", whenever he appears, and why only you acknowledge his presence. Indeed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">you were just simply following his commands</a>.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock2">System Shock 2</a></em> is <em>infamous</em> for doing this.

</li></ul></li><li> Several critics noted that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em> series's habit of including "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">shocking moments</a>" during their respective campaigns were often so shocking precisely because they played with the player's expectations of video game conventions. In the first game, a nuclear weapon explodes, killing the player character, who spends several agonising minutes dragging his body around before succumbing to radiation poisoning. Early in the second game, the player briefly plays as an undercover American agent in a Russian terrorist cell, who is forced to watch/participate as the terrorists mercilessly gun down an airport full of civilians. As Yahtzee of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">Zero Punctuation</a></em> put it:
<div class="indent">What made [the nuke sequence in <em>Modern Warfare</em>] even more interesting for me was that it played with the expectations one has of a game. You do not expect the character you are playing as to bite it in such a drawn-out, hideous way. The one thing you're usually sure of in a game is that whatever happens to everyone else, you are going to survive. There's no game otherwise. Even while watching your arms and legs getting sawn off half-way through <em>Quake 4</em>, or getting thrown clear of a crashing vehicle in every fucking shooter in the universe, you know there's no possible way you won't live on. Even better, moments before that moment in <em>MW1</em> your lads had just gone back into the danger zone to rescue a comrade, which you'd think would give you a double layer of plot armor. [The second game] finds a different way to play with our expectations of a player character by having us participate in a massacre of innocent civilians. It gives us the usual nose-leading mission directive but simultaneously, within the context of the world, condemns us for following it. It brings to mind that one science experiment where members of the public continued electrocuting a prisoner because an authority figure told them to. How much would it take to persuade an average person to commit an atrocity?
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLifeAlyx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLifeAlyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a></em> presents itself as a prequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> where you play as Alyx in an unknown adventure before the events the second game. Seems pretty standard stuff, saving her dad, inconviencing the Combine, making her way through dangerous territory, etc <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until the end where you try to capture a "important cargo" the Combine has and it turns out it's the G-Man. In graditute for saving him, he offers Alyx a glimpse into the future into the events of <em>Half-Life 2 Episode 2</em> and sees the death of Eli, allowing her to change events to save him. She takes the offer only to now end up in his "employ". So essentially the whole game was a time-traveling ploy on his part to get around a loophole the Vortigaunts exploited to keep Gordon out of his "employ" and you were played like a puppet. On the upside the game ends at the end of Episode 2 with you briefly in control of Gordon as Alyx's now alive father recovers, both find Alyx missing and Eli swearing revenge on the G-Man for his actions.</span>

The heroes succeed, but now what happens beyond the Midgar chapter is completely a blank slate where anything can happen (And indeed we see some of the changes such as Biggs, Wedge and Jessie all surviving the collapse of the Sector 7 plate, and Zack having managed to defeat the Shinra forces that initially killed him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em>, which <em>will</em> absolutely change the timeline).

</li><li> The killer's identity, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is a person both you and the cast least expect.

<ul><li> Firstly, the game completely plays with your perception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>. Play through the game like it's a normal RPG, fighting enemies and bosses, earning exp and leveling up? Well, at the end of the game you're told that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">EXP</a> stands for <strong>Ex</strong>ecution <strong>P</strong>oints, and is a measurement unit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">how much pain you've inflicted on others,</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel">LV,</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">LOVE</a> as it's otherwise called in <em>Undertale,</em> is <strong>L</strong>evel <strong>o</strong>f <strong>V</strong>iolenc<strong>e</strong>, and acts as a measurement unit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItGetsEasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItGetsEasier">how desensitized you've</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainingTheWillToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainingTheWillToKill">become to killing.</a> Playing this way puts you on track for the worst ending, which reveals that <em>YOU</em>, the player, are the real villain of the story, and every boss you mercilessly cut down was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a> out to stop you. It also invokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks">Being Evil Sucks</a> by making every fight an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnticlimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnticlimaxBoss">Anticlimax Boss</a> that goes down in one hit, and the few that don't are designed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">as frustrating as possible</a>.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> by sparing the sympathetic characters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">only killing minor enemies</a>? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You're told that every monster you killed could have had friends and family, the general populous and one of those main characters will still remember you as a mass murderer, and you get called out for being a hypocrite.</span> The only way to achieve the best ending is through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">Pacifist Run</a>.
</li><li> Even that contains a bit of this: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> actually hints you towards the True Ending because he <em>knows</em> that you'll want to go for it as a completionist, and through this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> uses you to get everyone you befriended into one place so he can absorb their souls.</span> The game also plays with your notions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>: the game itself <em>begs</em> you not to reset after achieving a happy ending, because you'd be taking that away from all the characters. If you reset a Pacifist file and go for an evil playthrough out of curiosity, multiple NPCs will be aware of this and will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">call you out on it.</a> And getting the worst ending even <em>once</em> permenantly taints any future happy ending you achieve. In other words, exploring every route the game has to offer is a <em>very</em> bad thing, some paths are better off never being taken.
</li><li> The game also plays with the concept of saving by exploring one simple question: <em>what does saving and resetting look like to the characters within a game?</em> One character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a> simply due to being aware of the player's save/reload powers: he knows the world is being continually reset, so he doesn't see the point of caring about anything anymore. Other characters are aware of what you did in earlier files, some bosses are <em>aware of how many times you've died to them</em> and as said above, resetting a True Ending file is seen as undoing everyone's happy ending. The few characters who are fully aware of the resetting treat the player as some kind of horrifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> who torments them out of boredom.

So the only thing he can do is just focus on rebuilding and paying those back who destroyed his base. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Except he's <em>not</em> the Big Boss. The character you play through the game is really the nameless medic from <em>Ground Zeros</em> that got caught in the helicopter blast. He was just given cosmetic surgery and hypnotized into thinking he was the real Big Boss to act as the decoy to the Patriots while the real Big Boss rebuilds his forces in secret (In fact Ishmel, the man who helps you at the beginning of the game, is the real Big Boss just helping you escape to put his plans into motion). It's <em>heavily</em> implied that this is the Big Boss you fight in the first Metal Gear game. So you pretty much more or less created the villain of that game.</span>

This is all typical video game stuff designed to move the plot along, because in real life this guy would have serious problems. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That's because he does. Turns out his wife only died a few weeks ago, because he <em>murdered</em> her, and the whole game is a karmic beatdown he well deserves</span>.

<ul><li> What's especially notable about this example are the endings <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as they technically are not "endings" whatsoever in the typical fashion. The story will always end with Cheryl leaving the session and meeting up with her mother before fading to black. So what do the "endings" dictate? <em>Harry's character</em>. That's right...your actions are determining the kind of person Harry was before his death, as either a good man who divorced his wife but assured his daughter that they both still loved her, a weak man dominated by his wife entirely, an alcoholic, or an adulterer.

It then double twists it by having the actual player character be Brian's closet gay best friend Kyle, who became jealous of Sam and Brian's relationship and orchestrated the events that ended with her death and him moving away.

Meanwhile you have a witness who seems to know a lot more than she's letting on. There's a dark secret hidden behind everything, which could form a plausible motive for her.

Japanese gamers don't like the idea of playing as old men because they can't be awesome (basically). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So the game has you play as an old man but tricks you into thinking he's college age.</span>
</li><li> Also in <em>VLR</em>, you can choose to ally or betray characters, like in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>. Ally with a character who betrays you and you would understandably realize you should have picked betray as well. Going back to betray will, on a few occasions, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cause the other character to pick ally, and the characters deride you for betraying someone who was willing to ally with you.</span> Your character even questions this, but isn't really sure why he's questioning it until later. In one specific example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the game switches roles, and this time you're allying with a character who has already been betrayed by you in a different timeline, who is taking revenge on you on HER subsequent playthrough.</span>
</li><li> The third game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma">Zero Time Dilemma</a></em>, abandons the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">Visual Novel</a> presentation in favor of a more cutscene-based game inspired by more western examples of visual novels like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then it turns out that those cutscenes were actually recordings by security cameras set up by Delta, a tenth participant in the game that you as the player don't find out about until the reveal, but the rest of the cast knows already.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The featured romance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MagicalDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MagicalDiary">Magical Diary</a></em> is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with a 'bad boy' character who is actually playing on the trope expectations of the target audience to lull the character, and the player, into doing exactly what he wants.</span> Many players recognise the manipulation on a character level and laugh about playing out the "cheesy romance", but don't realise that they themselves are being tricked as well. There are YouTube videos of <em>horrified shrieking</em> from players suddenly discovering that they were being played all along.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/YouAndMeAndHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/YouAndMeAndHer">You and Me and Her</a>:</em>
<ul><li> One of the supporting characters in the game is Haru, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> and member of the drama club who freaks out at the slightest encounter with Shinichi, and who works at the store <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BromanticFoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BromanticFoil">Yuutarou's</a> family owns. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Because Haru isn't a girl, he's actually Ryuujirou, Yuutarou's oft-mentioned crossdressing younger brother. Carefully, the game only shows Haru in uniform in the auditorium, just to trick you into thinking they're separate characters.</span>
</li><li> Despite some strange metafiction sprinkled throughout involving Aoi, the Miyuki's route, the first route of the game is a fairly normal romance story. After the player decides to do Aoi's, however, a series of strange questions begin popping up that, if chosen incorrectly, suddenly lock the player into replaying Miyuki's ending. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Because Miyuki's actually fully aware of the events of her route, and intentionally trying to sabotage you. Once she reveals herself, she hijacks the game and intentionally removes the save feature, just to ensure you can't fight her.</span>
</li><li> Near the end of the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the player drugs Miyuki and steals her phone to try and restore Aoi to life</span>. In order to access it, the player needs to fill out a ten question quiz on Miyuki, with the answers all being spread out throughout the latter half of the game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except it's a lie. Not only is Miyuki faking being drugged, but the questions are actually randomised to a variable of over <em>two trillion</em> and are something she intentionally included just to try and make you love her more.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FleuretBlanc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FleuretBlanc">Fleuret Blanc</a></em> is materialism and obsession — two things that video games, by their nature, tend to encourage. This makes for a very interesting choice of medium, and the dissonance is played up for all it's worth. The mechanics encourage you to reduce your co-workers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> and hoard their prized possessions — which don't even have any meaning to you! — all while characters wax philosophical about the meaning of objects in our lives and if we can really gain happiness just through having enough possessions. One of the characters is an avid gamer obsessed with virtual achievements and the like. Gaining an item results in a cheerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemGet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemGet">Item Get!</a> jingle, while losing one results in a sad trombone noise, even when it's part of a scripted sequence. This makes many players have a kneejerk negative reaction to losing items, even when it makes perfect sense and is the smarter option. The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gold placard</span> is a particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a> in this regard; it's <em>only ever added to the inventory in cutscenes</em>, because Florentine always discards it again by the end of the scene. You never keep it permanently, even though it looks like a legitimate item. The game also dramatically tallies up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoringPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoringPoints">Scoring Points</a> at the end of every day over a background that says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Everything is collectible</a>"; these points do absolutely nothing. While there is never any explicit betrayal of the player on the level of some other examples here, the game is carefully crafted to make the player uncomfortable and reevaluate their behavior.
