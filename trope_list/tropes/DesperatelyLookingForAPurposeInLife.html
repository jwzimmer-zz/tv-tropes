</p><p>Some will be lucky enough to quickly find a thing they can do. There are others who have to search a little bit more. The person who is Desperately Looking for a Purpose in Life is searching for what they could be good at or what would spiritually satisfy them and will try every possibility, even the most outlandish and odd. Obviously, with little or no success. If for some reason they succeed in their new field, they will still feel empty and will quickly abandon the effort at the first chance, going back to the pursuit of their "destiny".

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: Cell becomes a minor example after reaching his perfect form; he candidly tells Trunks that now that he has attained ultimate power, even killing Goku, the purpose for which he was created, has lost all meaning to him. The Cell Games are basically his way of figuring out what to do next. He finally discovers it through an epiphany caused by his near-death and rebirth from self-destruction: that Dr. Gero hadn't created him just to kill Goku or destroy the Earth, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">to be the end of all living beings in the entire universe</a>, a role Cell embraces wholeheartedly with joy.
</li><li> Medaka of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em> was the perfect human. Everything she tried she could do, she could outdo any adult in any academic study <em>at the age of one</em>, she had and could read entire libraries and she aged physically faster than her older siblings. This, of course, meant she had no clue how normal humans worked and didn't understand what failure even was, having never experienced it. By the time she was two, she was dangerously close to losing all connection with humanity, not being able to see a reason for anything anymore. Then she met Zenkichi, who told her that she existed to make people happy. This became <em>her</em> entire reason for existing from than on. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When she fails for the first time when Zenkichi beats her in the school president election, she nearly snaps and breaks down on the spot, thinking her reason for existing is no longer there and is <em>literally</em> unable to function without it.</span>
</li><li> Hisashi Mitsui from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em>, who was a talented basketball player until a knee injury got him out of the courts. He eventually becomes a delinquent and gang leader out of pure grief; but when circumstances (and the messianic intervention of a certain professor) give him a second chance to came back, he willingly and gleefully abandons the thug lifestyle. Perhaps <em>too</em> willingly.
</li><li> Yusuke Urameshi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> is a bit of a darker example in that ultimately only fighting ever seems to bring happiness, but even that feels empty. He finally dies saving a kid and becomes a "Spirit Detective" but even then he still does not know.
<ul><li> Eventually he builds up a network of allies, revolutionizes demon politics for at least a while, opens a ramen stand, and gets married. Somewhere in 'having loads of buddies,' 'being a major political presence due to being able to punch mountains to death,' 'starting a family,' and 'not needing to worry about spending his time wisely because he's probably immortal,' he seems to find a happy place. And yes, there is a very bad case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a> going on here. In the first volume, he got blasted into outer space by the ghost of a little girl.
</li><li> Note that this is a guy who began the series with only one friend (the girl he ends up married to) and she spent most of their interactions yelling at him. The moments when he started treating Kuwabara as an ally, saved Kurama's life and trusted Hiei for no good reason respectively set him up to completely change everything at least as much as dying and getting superpowers ever did. And he'd never have survived long enough to recover from his second death without his team.
</li><li> This comes full circle in the anime, where during his final fight of the series with Yomi, Yusuke realizes that he still doesn't have a purpose beyond his anger and that this is a problem since he is no longer angry. It takes a scolding from Raizen for Yusuke to finally realize what his purpose is: protecting his friends and reconciling his identity so he can be happy with Keiko.
</li></ul></li><li> BlackWarGreymon spends most of his time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> running around and destroying things for this reason, though this is mostly stemmed from his agonising over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure is a Non-Digimon?</a>. Eventually, he does find a purpose... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">if a very short-lived one.</a>
</li><li> Nozomi, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5">Yes! Pretty Cure 5</a></em>, is like this at the start of the series, though she finds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">something to do</a> by the end of the first episode. She's mentioned to have joined a series of different clubs, always ending in disaster. This is mostly credited to her rather short attention span, but when she actually <em>decides</em> to do something, she'll see it through it to the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>. Haruhi's titular melancholy comes from the fact that she's desperate for something so fun and exciting that it'll shake up her life. She's joined every club, dated every boy who asked her out (however briefly), and never lasted more than a week with anything but the SOS-dan, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn">she started herself</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The irony here is that the things she's searching for are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasWithYouAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasWithYouAllAlong">right there</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">trying to keep her from finding out</a></span>.
<ul><li> Subverted by Kyon. The novel opens with him claiming he wanted espers, aliens, and time travelers to exist, but closes that speech by saying he's given up and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">is fine with school and normal stuff</a>.

<ul><li> The heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> was like this when we first met her (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">very</a></em> much like this in the manga supplement of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">cinematic adaptation</a>), despite the fact that she was <em>nine years old</em>. When a <strike>boy</strike> ferret from another world asked her for help, she rushed to help him. Hers isn't so much a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall">Jumped at the Call</a> as it is already at the springboard looking for it. By the end, she's found her place in life and we now know her as the most badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> in history.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation">Sound Stage</a> for the first movie where her daughter Vivio is worried that she'll never find her purpose in life because <em>she isn't desperate enough</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/CielTheLastAutumnStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/CielTheLastAutumnStory">Ciel The Last Autumn Story</a></em>, due to sort of having an empty abyss in her soul, Yvienne Magnolia is at a loss for why she should care whether she lives or dies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>-experiencer Lariatte Kingdiamond ultimately helps provide some dreams for her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoldenBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoldenBoy">Golden Boy</a></em>:
<ul><li> This ecchi anime series has the hero's lust for women. Every episode he meets some new ridiculously attractive woman and goes on an epic-level mission to win her favor. It inevitably ends with him having somehow managed to win her heart, leaving her ready and wanting... and watching him as he heads off into the sunset, off to win his next prize without even having claimed the last. (Oh, Japan.)
</li><li> In the manga, one of the girls of the week shows the dark side of this trope. During her arc, she gradually falls out of love with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">her master</a>, and in love with Kintaro because he will not break no matter what she does to him. So after he leaves because he has learned what he wanted to that arc she decides to chase after him to find a new purpose. In her efforts to track him down she runs across some of the people he helped in the past. She systematically broke them to find out if the purpose they gained from meeting him could be one she could use.
</li></ul></li><li> Autor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em> starts to do this when it turns out he's not "chosen" to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Drosselmeyer's heir</span>. He even lampshades it in one scene, when he marches through the streets of his town grumbling to himself "What was I born into this world for?!"
</li><li> Lelouch Lamperouge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> was shown to have elements of this in the first episode, before he got his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye">Magical Eye</a>. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopOrIShootMyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopOrIShootMyself">even threatened suicide early on</a> when the prospect of becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High-School Student</a> again was almost forced upon him by the person who gave him the initial opportunity to change his fate. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his memories were rewritten by the Emperor</span> at the beginning of R2, he was shown to have reverted to this feeling of crushing boredom, tired of high school but convinced the adult world wouldn't afford him any opportunities to live up to his potential, since important jobs were generally reserved for nobility. In both cases, he resorted to high-stakes gambling in order to make things interesting. Luckily, encounters with C.C. changed all that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, this is a major theme for most of the more sympathetic antagonists. Haku, Gaara, and Kimimaro all have shades of this, with Haku and Kimimaro finding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">meaning in being tools to their masters</a> (while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> this trope as the reason why they are happy with their situation), while Gaara is so lonely and desperate to find a purpose that he constantly tries to "prove his existence" by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">killing people</a></em>. Even the bigger arc villains like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">Orochimaru</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Madara</a> have shades of this, with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> showing them desperately latching onto an idea from someone else in order to find happiness/achieve their goal in life while at their lowest point.
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> has this as her fundamental character problem. Though it gets eclipsed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">later events</a>, she was quite willing to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> just to have a purpose.
<ul><li> Homura was also this, being a socially isolated orphan who spent half her life in the hospital. Part of the reason she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">protects Madoka</span> so adamantly is because—painful as the task is—it gives her a purpose to strive for and center her identity around. (In the finale, when this goal is actually achieved, she freaks out and starts crying.) Homura's character arc ends with her finding a meaningful purpose <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that isn't dependent on Madoka or anyone else</span> and asserting it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as she fights Wraiths</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Hachiken Yugo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilverSpoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilverSpoon">Silver Spoon</a></em> has this as one of his major problems.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, Shinji gets assigned to save the world from aliens starting in the first episode, but he still feels like he doesn't know what his purpose in life is. Pretty much the entire show becomes about this. Midway through the show, he discovers that piloting the Eva gives him purpose, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">last two episodes</a> are all about him now trying to find meaning without it. Other characters have arcs like this too.
</li><li> A darker example happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombieLoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombieLoan">Zombie Loan</a></em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Reiichirou Chiba</span> becomes so jaded with his boring life and how predictable his future will be that he kills himself. At which point he comes back to life as a superpowered zombie and becomes a serial killer. He is an <em>extremely</em> happy character. So, yeah. Cruel, psychotic bastard, but quite happy. So... he did kind of get his wish.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>, the main character Touma bemoaned his lack of ability, with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">power</a> not able to fight thugs, help his test scores, or get him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">girlfriend</a>. That is until Index falls onto his balcony and he is suddenly thrust into a world where his ability is the only thing keeping him alive as he desperately tries to save people.
</li><li> Maon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Tamayura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Tamayura">Tamayura</a></em> has this, making her hop from one hobby to the next.

Despite assurances to his friends and family that he was happier as a normal person, all of them understood he was lying to himself. It's no surprise to anyone when he blindly latches onto the first opportunity to gain power again.
</li><li> This is Yagami Light's state of being as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> opens. He despises the state of the world, finds no challenge or meaning in anything, has no hobbies, views his highest ambitions as a matter of the course of time, and yet <em>always does everything perfectly</em>, like laughing at jokes that aren't funny told by people he may even loathe because good, clean-cut students socialize, and studying for exams he could pass in his sleep. He shows symptoms of a clinically depressed possible psychopath, with reputation-defense and control issues to beat the band. And his egomaniacal tendencies begin to dominate his personality after he finds his purpose in conquering the world by fear and murder once he got his hands on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> that removed the consequences from hurting people.
<ul><li> Though during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemoryGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemoryGambit">Memory Gambit</a> though, we see another side of Light. having relinquished possession of the Death Note and losing his memories as part of an elaborate ruse, Light changes considerably. He's more optimistic and idealistic than even before getting the Death Note yet also more mature in accepting certain aspects are outside of control though still wanting to do the right thing. Light not only helps L in finding "Kira" but also works to try and rein L in.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is what at least Niikura Shou was experiencing when he discovered his origins and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akumetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akumetsu">Akumetsu</a> the clone army was born. Most other Shous are only shown after a lot of brain-sharing, body-replacement, and Akumetsu's launch, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SendInTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SendInTheClones">they aren't really individuals anymore</a>, but him at least, and probably Hazama too.

Typified by his not actually playing any baseball even though he likes it and trying to walk away and let Muraken get bullied, but not being able to go through with it once he realizes he's been recognized. <em>Then</em> he gets himself swirlied into another dimension while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Murata apparently cravenly abandons him, presumably runs straight for the cops, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">reality</a></em> must have stood right beside the toilets facilitating the dimensional leap from his side to make it possible.</span>
<ul><li> But he doesn't take the kingship because they're offering him power and meaning; the whole deal freaks him out until he can only influence whether there's war by accepting. It takes him a while after that to adapt, and even then it's largely less him 'growing up' than him forgetting to whine or worry about himself because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">MUST SAVE THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD AS SOON AS HE NOTICES EVERY PROBLEM IT HAS</a>. If he weren't such an unobservant moron, he'd work himself to the bone.

The majority were in one manner or another failing in life and lacked direction or purpose prior to meeting their Sekirei, but this is best exemplified by Minato and Mikogami. Minato was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary College Student</a> type that was failing at life, and feeling lost until destiny literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrashIntoHello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrashIntoHello">fell on him</a>, while Mikogami was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">Lonely Rich Kid</a> with controlling parents, who desperately wished for "something amazing" to happen.

Her mother was furious when she broke off their engagement after she caught her fiancee cheating, and demanded Bria get back together with him because of the "great match" the pair had in her mind.

He succeeds in finding one as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becoming the new Guardian of the Roamers in service of Lala the dancer, whom he falls in love with.

If you do a sidequest for him, he eventually finds his knack for chocobo ranching. There is some exploration of this theme in the case of the Youth League, New Yevon, and the Ronso as well.
<ul><li> In fact, it's a theme for the main characters too. Yuna having completed her supposed suicide mission is left with a lifetime of summoner training and no ability to use it. Paine is looking for a purpose, any purpose to distract her from what happened on the Crimson Squad, and Rikku (unbelievably, but accurately the most well adjusted of the three) just wants to have fun.
</li><li> All of Spira seems to have fallen into this after Sin's downfall. It's still an improvement since the only "purpose" they had when Sin was around was simple survival.

After shifting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> following the first Act of the game's story, he admits to Ashe that even with his hatred of '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>'' he had no purpose in life, making up stories like "I want to be a Sky Pirate" simply to stave off the feeling of being hollow and alone. He sticks with the party because he's hoping he will find his purpose in life with Ashe.

When the party enters his section of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld">TV world</a>, it turns out to be an NES-style RPG dungeon, aptly titled "Void Quest." Along the way, we get some delightful narration along the lines of "Mitsuo slays Television Anchor (referring to a real murder in the outside world). Mitsuo gains a level. Mitsuo gains 2 Emptiness points." His shadow (the repressed part of himself) tells him that he has no purpose in life and that he'll never feel satisfied with anything. Unlike everyone else thrown in the TV world up to that point, he doesn't conquer his shadow and merely gets arrested while still in denial.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> has Junpei Iori, who struggles with the knowledge that defeating the Shadows will mean having to face this trope head-on. It also has Yuko Nishiwaki facing the same problem, with her Social Link revolving around her discovering that purpose. It is also treated negatively; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Jin Shirato</a> turned evil because Takaya gave him a purpose in life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1">Persona</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> Maki Sonomura, who puts on a brave face but swiftly becomes apparent that she hates her life stuck in the hospital with reading and painting as her only escapes - but she really doesn't know what she'd do with herself because she's not sure she'll be healthy enough to ever do <em>anything</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By <em>Persona 2</em> she has started working in psychiatry and finds fulfillment in helping others find their own fulfillment and purpose.</span>

And then you died!" In the third game, you find him among refugees, unknowingly "recruiting" for a pro-human organization that has actually gone bad. Except he was being used again as an annoying distraction while someone else was doing something nefarious. Talking to him again reveals that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> has a Ph.D. in astrophysics and had written a dissertation on dark energy</span>. Even with that, he had drifted around trying to be something he was not.

Assuming he survives Act I, this can lead to one of two things happening: Either he contracts the Darkspawn taint and is forced to become a Grey Warden to survive, or he chooses to join the Mage-hunting Templars. Ironically, despite having it forced upon him, he finds work as a Grey Warden fulfilling. The Templar order, on the other hand, he turns out to not quite have the stomach for...
<ul><li> Viscount Dumar's son Saemus finds the Qunari extremely attractive due to their absolute certainty of purpose in life compared to his own wanderings. Not that this ends well for him, as it alienates his father and others. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Plus he winds up being killed by Petrice to kick off a war with the Qunari.</span>

A recurring gag on the show is Homer protesting to Marge that this new job is his lifelong dream, only for Marge to bring up another "lifelong dream" Homer had which he'd already accomplished or failed miserably at. Inevitably, he either gets fired for his incompetence or abandons it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision">for the sake of his family</a>.

</li><li> Audrey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleShop">Little Shop</a></em> (the <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em> cartoon) had a new life's ambition in each episode.

Once he has Lex at the palm of his hand, he doesn't intend to kill him, but only ask one important question, what is his purpose. He ask Lex because he embodies the most mankind would ever want, yet he craves more. Lex simply tells him to search for one, as no one really knows it. The episode ends with Doctor Fate offering Amazo to find a purpose in life, simply because it's his purpose, to which Amazo accepts.

<ul><li> "Call of the Cutie" reveals that ponies gain their cutie marks after discovering their purpose. This tends to occur around a certain age, leading to Apple Bloom desperately trying to discover her purpose because she doesn't want to be the last young pony in her class left 'blank-flanked'. The episode ends with Apple Bloom and two classmates forming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> called the Cutie Mark Crusaders, specifically devoted to carrying out this trope. They spend various episodes trying to get their marks and while they might not have gotten the desired results yet, at least they're having a lot of fun trying. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Cutie Mark Crusaders <em>finally</em> get their marks after five seasons of trying in "Crusaders of the Lost Mark". Their purpose is to help others find or understand their purpose. Of course, that means they're also at a loss at what to do <em>afterward</em>, so initially they (or at least Apple Bloom) still do this in the episode "On Your Marks".</span>
</li><li> This trope is also used to a lesser extent in "Winter Wrap-up", with Twilight spending most of the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantSong">singing</a> and attempting to find a way to help in the titular event that specifically forbids her using magic.

A pilgrim comes to a stone idol in the desert, and asks it, "What is my purpose?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the idol comes to life and eats him, then spits out his staff onto a nearby pile of similar staffs.</span>
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleBill">Little Bill</a></em> played this lite, with Bill going around trying to "find my thing", the thing he's good at.
</li><li> Betty Staines from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StainesDownDrains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StainesDownDrains">Staines Down Drains</a></em>, who is shown starting a new job at the beginning of every episode.

As he begins to question his goals, however, this trope comes more and more into play, culminating in the first half of season 3.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pearl rebelled against Homeworld both out of devotion to Rose Quartz and to break from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace">Servant Race</a> status. However, her primary role in the series proper has been to continue the clean-up from the Gem civil war and take care of Steven, both tasks inextricably tied to Rose Quartz and the Crystal Gem's mission. Despite being a free Gem for 5000 years, she hasn't established an identity outside of that in all that time, and for the most part, doesn't seem to know how to. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Peridot</span> asks her "What are you for?" in "Back to the Barn", she is left incapable of coming up with an answer. Season 5 has made this more complicated with the reveal of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pink Diamond being Rose Quartz and thus, Pearl being the Pearl of Pink Diamond. It further explains that without her Diamond, Pearl is at a loss on what to do in the long term.</span> She is slowly getting better though.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Future</a></em>, Steven himself has no idea what to do with himself now that everyone else around him has managed to find contentment in their lives, as his life previously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">had been spent helping them through their problems</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The show ultimately ends with him leaving the Crystal Gems on a journey to go find a new purpose in life.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jasper</span>. also seems to be suffering this in <em>Future</em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As a quartz, her whole purpose in life was to fight and conquer - and unlike the rest of gem society, she adamantly refuses to adjust to the new status quo after the Gem Empire gives up on conquest. She's shown spending her days in a cave outside Beach City, and training for fights that will now never happen. She <em>embraces</em> the idea of having Steven as her new Diamond after her accidentally shatters and heals her, and seems genuinely crestfallen when he denies her that</span>.
