</div></div><p>A trope often found in situation comedy, it's where the boss (often a somewhat unpleasant one) places a relative or in-law in a position of power. Invariably, the relative will be incompetent or worse. A variation on this trope might be to actually have the relative be the protagonist, and have to earn the respect of his or her subordinates before they can actually accomplish anything meaningful. The trope can also be subverted if the relative is actually <em>competent</em>, in which case the grumbling can quickly subside. It can be averted in cases where nepotism is <em>expected</em>, such as a prince becoming king when his father dies, in which case most people just accept it as the way things are supposed to go.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth</a></em> manga, Randolph Miller, director of the Seselagi Art Museum, hires his niece Monet Kreskin because she needs a job after graduating college, even though she knows nothing about art. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's actually in large part <em>because</em> she knows nothing about art, and won't be able to tell that he sold the painting "Officers" to pay the museum's debts, replacing it with a fake</span>.
</li><li> Discussed and defied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ActionHeroineCheerFruits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ActionHeroineCheerFruits">Action Heroine Cheer Fruits</a></em>; Misaki Shirogane realizes that Hatsuri Momoi would be the perfect candidate to join the Cheer Fruits, but since their families have a business relationship it would look suspicious if they just let her join no questions asked. The girls hold an audition, but Hatsuri fails because she goes overboard with the pyrotechnics; that night at home her father offers to put a word in with the Shirogane family but she refuses, saying that she has to <em>earn</em> her spot on the team with her own talents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> has two examples, both of which are played atypically.
<ul><li> The first is Ladd Russo who, while definitely not incompetent, <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">completely off his rocker</a>. His uncle made him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">a hitman</a> mostly to channel his homicidal urges more efficiently.
</li><li> The second and more serious example is, surprisingly enough, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Luck Gandor</a></em>. While he certainly doesn't <em>seem</em> like someone who got his position from connections alone, careful examination of the evidence (and eventual confirmation in <em>The Slash</em>) would reveal that he's been in the higher ranks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">since age fifteen or younger</a>, and only because his brothers were in charge. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid">He has quite a bit</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask">of a complex over it</a>, and goes to considerable lengths to leave no possible doubt that he's capable.
</li></ul></li><li> Ren's old teammates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BigWindup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BigWindup">Big Windup!</a></em> feel that he's in the pitcher position only because he's related to the school board director and that he is incompetent. He's actually a good pitcher, but the team just doesn't co-operate with him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em> has Saeko Nogami: she's an extremely competent police officer of her own, but it's implied that she gets away with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">her non-standard methods</a> and some other stunts of hers (such as <em>hospitalizing six suitors</em>) by virtue of being the eldest daughter of the superintendent general. Her sister Reika was heavily implied to having got back her job as a police officer after quitting thanks to this... Then she quit again, and for good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. While several members of the Britannian Imperial Family may be very qualified and competent, there are plenty of others who were less so. Clovis and Odysseus come to mind, who each have "son of the emperor" as their best qualities.
<ul><li> They do have some talent: Clovis was able to run a decent conspiracy, and Odysseus has the remarkable talent among the royals as 'generally sane'.
</li><li> Nunally was appointed Governor of Tokyo by her father, but NOT because he wanted her to be safe or empowered in any way - it was so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYourWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYourWife">her face on the news every month, just out of reach, would tick Lelouch off</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope nearly destroyed The 108 Dragons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CryingFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CryingFreeman">Crying Freeman</a></em>. The former leaders' son was an uncontrollable monster. The granddaughter was even worse.
</li><li> Masaki Kirihara, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a> police officer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> is the daughter of a high-ranking Japanese politician, and some of her connections and position probably come from him, although she is very competent. In one episode, he draws upon his connections to offer her a promotion to a desk job — it's ambiguous whether this is out of concern for her safety or whether he's trying to have her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a> because he's a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">The Syndicate</a> himself (or possibly both). In any case, she turns him down. By the second season, she's so frustrated by this (and other meddling in the police department) that she quits and barely looks back.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> manga states that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Touta</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Matsuda</a> has relatives in the Police Force, hence why he has a job there despite being more or less well-intentioned, yet incompetent. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Until he goes all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass</a>, that is.</span>

Furthermore, the movie ends with the superintendent making it clear that his son will be prosecuted for the role he did play in the crime (blackmailing the victim).</span>
</li><li> In a filler case, a very rich guy got away with being a middle-class girl's absolutely terrifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> because of his rich family. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The poor girl realized that the only way to stop him from killing her would be brewing a plan to kill him first. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">Which she did</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ">Detective School Q</a></em>, Sakurako Yukihira defies the trope by not only being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> in her own right but by hiding the fact that she is the niece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Morihiko Dan</a> aka the director of the prestigious detective school that the members of the cast attend. She explains to Kyuu that, much as she loves and admires her uncle, she doesn't want other students to know their blood bond so she will be able to develop her detective talents in her own right.
</li><li> One of Ayumi Himekawa's main motivations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em> is to actually <em>avert</em> the trope. Both of her parents are veterans in the fields of visual media: her father Mitsugu is a famous film director, her mother Utako is pretty much <em>the</em> other Grand Dame in Japanese acting aside from Chigusa Tsukikage. Ayumi herself is very beautiful and genuinely talented in acting, but she's absolutely determined to <strong>not</strong> let people even utter the trope in front of her, and prove that she can reach stardom on her own and without any influence coming from her parents.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan">Haiyore! Nyarko-san</a></em>, Cuuko first shows up working with kidnappers, and then immediately after that case is resolved she gets into the Planetary Defense Organization because her uncle works in HR.

<ul><li> Daisuke Aurora has his job <em>in part</em> because his older brother is the police chief.
</li><li> Also, on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains">villains</a> side of the equation, Clair has his position of "Vampire" (Mob Boss) because his father specifically stated it in his will (the other members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> are <em>not</em> happy about this, partly because Clair is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid">only 19</a>, and partly because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>).

</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Zabis</a> all got their positions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> because their father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionBigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionBigBad">Degwin</a>, trusts them more than anyone else. It's played for tragedy in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">Garma</a>, whose obsession with proving that he deserves his job ultimately gets him killed; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Dozle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Kycillia</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Gihren</a> all establish early on that they <em><strong>are</strong></em> fully capable of doing a good job.
<ul><li> Garma's characterization gets completely inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin">Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin</a></em>, which makes him play the trope straight. In the anime he wanted to prove that he didn't just get his job because of who his father is; in <em>The Origin</em>, he literally throws a stompy-foot temper tantrum to Daddy and demands to be given an important position so he can show off to Char.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> has a half-example of sorts: the Hokage. All of them are related in some way, ever since the first one, Hashirama. The second was his brother, Tobirama, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who also created the Resurrection Technique used by both Orochimaru and Kabuto</span>, the Third was Sarutobi, their apprentice. The Fourth was Minato, who followed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain">Master-Apprentice Chain</a> from Jiraya, and was eventually replaced by Tsunade, Hashirama's grandaughter. Danzo would later point it out to the Fire Daimyo, saying how this chain has left the village soft on military issues, since the Hokage so far all had pacifist philosophies, resulting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Konoha's destruction by Pain</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a>, wouldn't you say? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not if he's using <em>that</em> example. Pain's turn to evil instead of the pacifism Jiraiya taught him was the direct result of his own interference. Though he probably doesn't know that.</span>
<ul><li> In addition to the relations, the Fourth is the father of the title character who strives to become Hokage himself. The eldest grandson of the Third also has the same goal, albeit to find some way to step out of his grandfather's shadow and be seen as something other than the Hokage's grandson (although his uncle Asuma did not have any apparent ambitions of the sort, though he did have a strained relationship with his father that resulted in him joining the 12 Guardian Ninjas for a while).
</li><li> If Naruto actually becomes Hokage, he'll not only be part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain">Master-Apprentice Chain</a> and the son of the Fourth Hokage but also related to the First, Second and Fifth Hokage on his mother's side of the family. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naruto becomes the 7th Hokage, so this happens. The 6th Hokage, Kakashi Hatake, also applies, as he was a student of the 4th Hokage and part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain">Master-Apprentice Chain</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Bizarrely enough, this gets referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>.</em> Since Shinji winds up becoming an accomplished EVA pilot and his father is the supreme commander of NERV, it's inevitable folks might start to look at things a little funny. In one episode, Gendo's superiors at SEELE joke about him having given Unit-01 to his son like it was a new toy, and in the second Rebuild movie, Asuka refers to Shinji as a "Daddy's Boy" who only got the job because he was well-connected. In reality of course, Shinji would give anything to <em>not</em> have to pilot the EVA, and Gendo is the last person to do his son any favors.
<ul><li> It's also suggested that accusations of this have shaped Ritsuko Akagi's view of the world since her mother Naoko worked at NERV's predecessor GEHIRN and it's implied she had something to do with Ritsuko gaining a position. To combat this Ritsuko has tried to be as little like her mother as possible, including dyeing her hair, but her breakdown at the end of the series comes about largely because she realizes she failed at this as well <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including sleeping with (and being heartlessly used by) Gendo just as her mother did</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NewGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NewGame">New Game!</a></em>, a variation happens. Umiko Ahagon and Nene Sakura are not related and had never met prior to the latter joining the former's company as a debugger, but gradually became friends over the course of their work. Sometime later, Nene applied for a job as a programmer, and Umiko hired her since while Nene didn't have enough skills at the moment, she did have potential. Tsubame "Naru" Narumi, who was hired at the same time, was displeased to hear about the circumstances behind Nene being hired since Naru herself had worked hard and paid her own way through school to prove that she could be a programmer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Naru isn't exactly wrong</a>, but she does come to realize that Nene is more skilled than she gives her credit for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: This is implied to be the reason why Spandam ended up being chief of CP9, despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Failure</a> and all-around waste of human life. His father, Spandine, was also chief of CP9, and almost as bad as him, though he was also decidedly more competent and had standards, unlike his son.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakiAchigaHen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakiAchigaHen">Saki Achiga-hen</a></em>, the Senriyama mahjong team includes the coach Masae Atago's (whose daughters play for another school's team) niece, Hiroko Funakubo, who, unlike many of these examples, is actually quite competent. Masae is pleased when she sees Hiroko doing well, hoping to avoid rumors of nepotism, but Cera, one of Hiroko's teammates, says people will make those rumors anyway.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SheBecomesATree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SheBecomesATree">She Becomes A Tree</a></em>, Kisaki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeLady">Office Lady</a> coworkers spread rumors that she got her job due to knowing one of the president's relatives. Kisaki seems to be quite good at her job, since her tree body parts enable her to work several times as quickly as other employees and other people routinely dump work on her, so the rumors seem to be mainly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">the other women disliking Kisaki for her being a tree/human hybrid</a>.
</li><li> This issue is explored thoroughly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SmileDownTheRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SmileDownTheRunway">Smile Down The Runway</a></em>. Sakuma Mii, the head of the novice department where Ikuto is first assigned to when he is hired as a full-time employee in Aphro I dite, is the daughter of the company's main sponsors. She spends most of her time lazing about and passes her actual work to the head designer of the company, and is seen as incompetent by pretty much everyone else. Later, she helps her former private tutor Hazime Yanagida to get a position as a department head in Aphro I dite, and he faces similar criticism from his subordinates. Ikuto is also accused of getting preferential treatment when his colleagues find out that he used to work for Yanagida. However, Yanagida mentions that it's alright to use one's connections to open up new opportunities for themselves, as long as they can prove themselves worthy of the position afterwards. Yanagida certainly proves his worth when his first Capsule Collection results in a resounding success; while Mii, who cannot do the same, loses her position to Ikuto.

The bank has for long been the private toy of the Lavish family, so Topsy passes it on to Moist Von Lipwig, who also keeps Hubert around.

It's said that even the customs officers change after dynastic succession. This isn't presented as entirely negative: families in the Empire are so extended and politically active the nepotism is less about giving incompetent family members sinecures as about filling positions with people who can be trusted not to be conspiring against the current imperial family.

It <em>was</em> nepotism that got Miles into the Imperial Military Academy, despite him not meeting the physical requirements, and nepotism that <em>kept</em> him in the Imperial Service after the Kyril Island incident.

There are also some people who reach high rank faster than normal or end up with plum assignments because of their family connections, who end up proving that they have the skill to go along with the rank nonetheless (Michael Oversteegen is the most obvious example, getting a heavy cruiser - a senior-grade captain's slot - while still a captain jay-gee and then using it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberWhenYouBlewUpASun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberWhenYouBlewUpASun">blow four enemy heavy cruisers out of space in a single engagement</a>).
<ul><li> Also averted with Michelle Henke, who is a noble in her own right as well as standing in succession to the throne (however distant) and is so terrified of being accused of this that it actually holds back her career quite significantly because the admiralty cannot promote her for her actions without fear that she'll see it as nepotism.
</li><li> Considering how often incompetents are shuffled off to "non-critical" posts and how it inevitably spectacularly blows up in their faces when Haven launches a surprise attack there, one wonders why nobody in the Admiralty has wizened up yet and just start beaching or outright discharging incompetents, politics be damned. Then again, we've already seen how incompetent politicals <em>also</em> get in the way of proper governance. It is acknowledged as the biggest weakness of having a House of Lords.

</li><li> Stated to be one of the problems facing the Solarian military: most of their senior military leadership gets their positions through having relatives who are also senior military leaders.

Who is in command of the host? Why, Ilya's own first cousin once removed General Ilovayskiy XII (Ilya just calls him "uncle"). Ilya's rank in the host is Khorunzhiy, a junior officer rank corresponding to a Second Lieutenant. Ilya frequently pulls stunts and displays the amount of insubordination that would get another Cossack whipped or kicked out (the first thing he does in the novel is steal his uncle's prized Arab horse and nearly gets the horse and himself killed), yet his uncle feels obligated to forgive his nephew in memory of Ilya's father.

The Night's Watch seems to be vulnerable to this beyond the cultural belief that nobles are more suitable, because it relies on the aid of others to sustain itself, and a lord is more likely to be helpful if his son is a prominent ranger than a random builder (though this can be justified because the noble has appropriate training from a young age). It's noted that the five youngest Lord Commanders of the Watch have all been close relatives of the Lord of Winterfell, and one of them was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem">ten years old</a></em>

They all have far-reaching, dangerous powers, and they were chosen because it was more important that they get their powers under control than the guy who teleports randomly every time he sneezes. The exception is Alice Adair, who simply levitates whenever she gets emotional. While hardly pleasant, she just has to stay inside and she's fine. However, her father is the richest man on the planet and owns a significant stake in the company that is running the procedure, so he insists she be part of the first run. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's implied that he knew she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">Gravity Master</a>, and that if she didn't get her power under control before that part of it manifested, she would start leveling buildings</span>. And then in Year 3, it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alice's father started the entire project to turn his Powered wife into a Super (who is supposedly dead, but actually in a coma). He put his daughter into the program because she is physiologically the closest person on the planet to his wife, and thus the best test case to see if the process would work on her</span>.
</li><li> A notable aversion in Year 2, when Alice joins the Subtlety class. Professor Pendleton absolutely refuses to show her any kindness or support and constantly tries to convince her to give up, since the class is completely outside of her skill set. Even when she does prove her skills, he threatens to throw her out for cheating. The only reason he doesn't is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">cheating is part of the point of the class</a>. The reason this is worth pointing out is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alice is Pendleton's niece (though she doesn't know it), and in fact the only reason he agreed to teach at all was that she was going to the school</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoirsOfAGeisha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoirsOfAGeisha">Memoirs of a Geisha</a></em>, this was why the Chairman's future son-in-law and heir nearly didn't go through with the marriage to his daughter, because he feared the Chairman might change his mind and leave the company to an illegitimate son instead simply because they were blood-related (as had happened to another company to much scandal). This is what led Sayuri to emigrate to America, because, as she put it, a child raised in America would likely never come back to Japan. (Understandably, she's mum on whether she gave birth to the Chairman's son.)

</li></ul><ul><li> This gets played with on <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BadBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BadBlood">Bad Blood</a></em>. Mob boss Vito Rosetti got his position because he is the son of the previous Don Nico Rosetti. However, everyone, including Nico, agrees that Vito is the more competent mob boss and is the one primarily responsible for making the Rosetti Family the most powerful mob family in Eastern Canada. Vito always makes a big deal about the importance of family but he actually sidelines his own son Nico Jr and promotes Declan Gardener, a man with no family ties to the Rosetti clan, to be his Number Two. He justifies this by claiming that he is preparing Nico to be the head of a legitimate Rosetti business empire and Declan's loyalty and long service to the Family has made him an honorary Rosetti in Vito's eyes. This all falls apart when Vito goes to prison and an attempt is made on Nico Jr's life. Vito tells Declan that he is just an employee and that Vito would gladly sacrifice him to protect his real son.
</li><li> Extensively played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>. Lee Adama gets accused of this by Kendra Shaw concerning his assignment to command of the <em>Battlestar Pegasus</em> by his Admiral father, which "your daddy just gave to you, like he was tossing you the keys to a new car". However, Adama only appointed him to the post after first going through two senior officers who both died in quick succession. Likewise with Lee becoming President — while Adama was committing something close to a military coup by refusing to recognize Zarek's control of the Colonial government despite being legally entitled to that position, Zarek was an unreliable power-seeker and Lee one of the few people available who he could trust. Baltar also espouses this for sympathy baiting in his political writings when he questions whether the fleet will ever be run by someone whose last name <em>isn't</em> Adama. But while the above examples are justified, Adama senior does have a strong tendency to let Lee, his assumed daughter Kara, and others close to him get away with a lot of crap and spends an inordinate amount of time and manpower to search for Thrace when she is stranded on a planet, even at the expense of fleet security.

Rather the Reagan family are brought up with tradition and heroic tales of police work until they each determine to become competent cops on their own account.

</li><li> Played with in one episode. An officer's name is recommended to him for promotion, which he initially rejects because he's the son of one of the chiefs and the name came recommended by Grandpa Henry. Frank is trying to avoid developing an "old boys club". Then he interviews the officer in question, who to his surprise agrees with him that he shouldn't be promoted because of connections. Frank is so impressed by the officer's humility that, coupled with his favorable record, he gives him the promotion after all.

Whenever he tries to discipline them, they <em>always</em> turns out to be a general or field marshall's nephew. In one episode, Hogan even disguises a Russian soldier as such an officer.

The sheriff is disqualified from running and his opponent becomes the new sheriff. Boyd Crowder bribed the sister and the county clerk to put her name on the payroll list so that Boyd's candidate would win the election.

When the board representative sarcastically exclaimed that he was surprised the manager wasn't playing his cat, the manager defensively claimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">it had a groin strain</a>.

Even the ship's computer was designed to deal cards and is partially there to add the names of their sponsors to their first contact message. Stewart's sister Karen may have also been placed there because of their relationship - specifically that they were hoping she wouldn't attempt a coup against the captain if it was her brother (she does).

He isn't totally incompetent and his status as Tony's cousin/"nephew" doesn't exempt him from hazing like random strip searches and having to buy everyone's meals. However, he rises up the ranks much faster than he probably would on his own merits, and is allowed far more free passes and second chances than Tony would ordinarily grant. Played straight when Tony privately tells Chris that he plans to eventually make Chris his Underboss rather than any of his longer serving and more qualified soldiers solely because he is blood.
</li><li> Subverted by Jackie Junior, who feels that since he is the son of a legendary mafioso, he is entitled to be a powerful and respected mob boss. Nobody takes him seriously, Tony actively prevents him from getting involved in anything, and his attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeBadass">be a badass criminal</a> end up getting him killed.

<ul><li> D'Angelo Barksdale is a softie and not really cut out for the game. However, his kinship as Avon Barksdale's nephew gives him great leeway.
</li><li> The dangerously incompetent Roland Pryzbylewski owes his police career to being the son-in-law of the influential Major Stan Valchek. He's prone to overreacting and panicking when out in the field, which causes all sorts of problems in his career that Valchek can't erase. Sadly, Prez is actually quite competent when analyzing data and working the paper trail. If he'd relied on his own devices to pursue a career based on his strengths rather than accept a handout from his father-in-law, he's probably have made a great analyst for the FBI or CIA.
</li><li> Proposition Joe has a big problem with this, his nephew Cheese being a major, but not the worst, example.

The Major Crimes Unit even contemplates busting a dealer higher up the chain in hopes that Drac gets promoted.

Frank assures the customer he'll square things with the customer's shipping agent, and yells at Ziggy, telling him he's fired. Frank storms off, and Ziggy looks at the customer contemptuously before wandering off as well. La La informs the customer Ziggy is Frank's son, and so the "firing" was just for show.
</li><li> Namond Brice got pushed by his mother De'Londa into street dealing. He coasts on his incarcerated father Wee-Bey's name and street reputation, but everybody realizes he's not cut out to be a player. Everybody, that is, except his own mother, who seems to think Namond could build a street empire the way Wee-Bey did with Stringer and Avonwith disastrous results. Colvin sees potential in Namond and eventually persuades Wee-Bey to give parental custody to him.

His supervisor bluntly tells him, "Good, because you're not getting any." Despite this, for the duration of the show, he had to fight accusations of it—it's assumed that the very reason he got such a plum position so soon after graduating from the academy is because of this and for the first few episodes, he overcompensates to prove his mettle—his father's attempts at displaying it—protecting him from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalAffairs">Internal Affairs</a> investigation—and people determined to bring him down to prove that it wasn't happening.

<ul><li> The closer you are to someone higher on the card (specifically those in the main event), the more likely you're going to get a push. Especially when that person is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>.
</li><li> Nearly every booker in the history of professional wrestling is guilty of this, at least to <em>some</em> degree. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes">Dusty Rhodes</a> became booker of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> back in the early nineties, his son Dustin (aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust">Goldust</a>) got pushed to the moon, but he at least <em>had</em> talent — Erik Watts, son of Bill Watts, was absolutely terrible but he got pushed at the expense of everyone else. The fans were aware of this and had no issue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">booing Erik out of the arena</a>.
<ul><li> In fact, it's widely believed that the reason Dustin went to WWF after he was fired from WCW (for blading in the infamously bad "King of the Road" match, which he must have known was against company policy) instead of letting Dusty get him rehired again was because he wanted a chance to make a career for himself out of his father's shadow and away from accusations of nepotism. It drove a rift between the two of them for years, but they made up eventually (helped by the fact that Goldust became such an iconic character).
</li></ul></li><li> If you're a second- and/or third-generation wrestler, expect a little favoritism. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>'s son David didn't even want to be a wrestler (he wanted to be a state trooper), but the large paychecks WCW was paying him changed his mind. The fans are very vocal about their hatred of this treatment unless the wrestler proves to have actual talent. Special mention must go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock">The Rock</a>, who debuted as goody-two-shoes Rocky Maivia (grandson of High Chief Peter Maivia) and was absolutely hated. "Die, Rocky, Die!" chants were not uncommon — until Rocky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turned heel</a>, joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNationOfDomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNationOfDomination">The Nation of Domination</a>, let himself loose on the mic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">and became</a> one of the two biggest wrestling superstars in history.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> is even worse than WCW in this regard, if that was even possible. Though, it was at its absolute worst during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> era, who, of course, brought in their guys and put the spotlight on them while basically pushing all the homegrown talent down the card. Dixie, a well-known money mark, did nothing to dissuade them and was even guilty of this herself at times, especially when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso">Vince Russo</a>.
<ul><li> It was so apparent that they eventually lampshaded it by debuting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EC3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EC3">Ethan Carter III</a> (NXT's Derrick Bateman), Dixie Carter's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>) nephew, who was showered with all sorts of attention in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">narmiest</a> way possible. Ironically, he's very popular with whatever is left of TNA's dwindling fanbase.
</li><li> TNA owes its very <em>existence</em> to this trope — the promotion was born after WCW folded. Jerry Jarrett created it to not only replace WCW but to also put the spotlight on his son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a>. Though eventually they lost control of the company to Dixie, and the nepotism became so bad under her rule that even Jeff was sick of it, tried to buy the company back, and when that didn't work, left and started <em>another</em> promotion.
</li><li> Then there was Garrett Bischoff. Garrett actually does seem to have talent, but he's still very green and got shilled by every main-eventer in the promotion, which did not endear him to the fans all that much.
</li><li> Brooke Hogan. Despite having no talent as a performer, not even being a <em>wrestler</em>, she got a disproportionate amount of screen-time — her romantic storyline with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys">Bully Ray</a> eventually became <em>the main event angle of TNA</em>, which just screams of nepotism.
</li></ul></li><li> More recently in the WWE, it's been said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> has been getting a Main Event push because of his Anoa'i family ties along with having the look and size Vince loves despite the fans having turned on him by Wrestlemania 31. That being said, Roman worked hard to improve in the last year and it became very clear that he does have talent. The problem is that the company still has no idea how to write his character and refused to let him use the one character that <em>worked</em> until it was too late, so people still hate the character despite him being a face. Occasionally, brilliance shines through, though it's muddled up by the company's terrible writing.
<ul><li> While Roman finally managed to win the fans over, the same accusations came to be leveled at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax">Nia Jax</a>, distantly related to Roman and The Rock (her father is The Rock's grandfather's first cousin). While she isn't as overpushed as Roman was, the backlash against her is far more vehement as, despite her intimidating size and presence, she's not only a mediocre ring worker, but she's proven to be a dangerous performer, <em>repeatedly</em> injuring other women she has to work with. WWE has been heavily criticised for continuing to employ her despite calls for her to be sent back to developmental for further training at best, or be released at worst, before she <em>cripples</em> someone.
</li></ul></li><li> As with so many other things in wrestling, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> is the <em>king</em> of this trope. Not only did he make himself one of the WWE's most prominent villains during the Attitude Era, but his children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie</a> have also had prominent roles as onscreen characters. Like Dusty and Cody Rhodes above, it's mitigated somewhat by Vince and his kids having genuine charisma and skill at drawing heel heat, and have even wrestled decent matches themselves. It also doesn't hurt that they've had multiple occasions of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkeys</a> who suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>. However, it <em>did</em> manage to infamously ruin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheInvasionAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheInvasionAngle">The InVasion Angle</a> when the angle started with Shane buying WCW out from under Vince and Stephanie buying out ECW and the two children teaming up to take on their father, turning the angle from the "WWF vs WCW (and ECW)" story that everyone wanted to see into yet another "McMahon vs McMahon" affair.
</li><li> A milder example cropped up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling">All Elite Wrestling</a> when they hired Dr. Luther, a bona-fide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOldies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOldies">ring oldie</a> who just entered his 50s, on the basis that he's a very old friend of top star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a>. The general consensus of the fans is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">it's hard to say that Luther has</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillGotIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillGotIt">Still Got It</a> (unlike Jericho, who's having one of the best runs of his career) and his ring work is considered mediocre at best, but since he's not pushed and hangs around the lower card mostly putting over young up-and-comers it's considered a harmless enough case of Jericho doing a favour for an old friend.

In fact, Arnold gets benched for several games just because he passed the ball to Gerald as Tucker wasn't open, despite the fact that they scored. Thus most of their drilling revolved around learning how to "get the ball to Tucker." It takes Tucker himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">calling out his father</a> for putting too much pressure on him to win basketball games to get Coach Wittenberg to stop.

<ul><li> In one episode, Mr. Krabs gives his daughter Pearl control of the restaurant. She promptly flips the place upside-down and changes the target demographic to vegetarian teenagers, much to SpongeBob's dismay. She was actually making horrible business choices so that her dad would take the restaurant back as she didn't want to run the place.
