This is often a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">artistic license</a> as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> technicalities frequently don't apply the way they are depicted or may not even <em>exist</em>. If the accused person is the protagonist, then the "technicality" will actually be an albatross for them, because no-one will believe they're actually innocent until the end of the story/series when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">actual criminal</a> is found.
</p><p>Most prevalent back in the 1960s and 1970s with the vigilante justice fad in fiction, after several court decisions seemed to tip the balance of the legal system far in favor of the accused. Since then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> police and other law enforcement personnel have had these changes included into their training to avoid screwing up their cases, and the fictional versions have become rarer. It still happens, but unlike in fiction, it's more often the excuse for the acquittal, rather than the reason. Such as when a judge or jury doesn't feel the person is guilty in spite of the evidence or does, but feels their actions were justified, and exploits the technicality as a legal grounds to dismiss the case. <em>Multiple</em> technicalities certainly <em>can</em> be the reason for someone being acquitted, but it wouldn't be this trope, as this is when a <em>single</em> technicality results in a "not guilty" ruling.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed versions</a>, on the other hand, are absolutely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. One example is where the technicality doesn't acquit someone outright, but goes in the defendant's favor. Most court cases are not made or broken on one thing, for <em>either side</em>. So a technicality can still reasonably be expected to <em>influence</em> the outcome of a case, but isn't likely to make or break it. Another example is the technicality resulting in a shaky case being dropped, or police falling just short of either reasonable suspicion or probable cause based on technicalities. If a case that's being built isn't particularly strong, it's not unheard of for prosecutors to either drop such cases or avoid putting too much energy into them if something, technicality or otherwise, gets in the way. So a technicality being <em>just enough</em> for an already iffy case not to end up in court is also Justified, as it happens in Real Life. If they get off completely when the case against them looked strong, it is almost always because the police or prosecution engaged in serious misconduct or completely dropped the ball on something extremely important. Even then, for them to get off completely instead of just getting a few charges thrown out, the judge has to <em>really</em> want to send a message, or the misconduct or bungling has to be so extreme that the entire conviction would have been overturned on appeal anyways.

</li><li> The man who shot Commissioner Gordon during the <em>Officer Down</em> storyline walked free. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKillerBecomesTheKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKillerBecomesTheKilled">His death</a> isn't so much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">made to look like an accident</a> as it is obvious that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">his old associates</a> got the leak on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitnessProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitnessProtection">Witness Protection</a> identity.
</li><li> It has even been played, at times, that confinement to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">Arkham Asylum</a> is less the result of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense">Insanity Defense</a> on the part of villains, but a legal technicality directly resultant from the fact that they were arrested and investigated by Batman rather than an agent of the law, which presumably would make evidence inadmissible if the cases went before a jury. In reality, the opposite is true — <em>any</em> evidence collected by a private citizen is always admissible, without exception; the exclusionary rule only covers evidence collected by government action. However, Batman might qualify as an agent of the police, since he works so closely with them (and has even been deputized), in which case the rule would apply. In any case, you can't just commit anyone to an institution anymore without grounds to believe they're a danger to themselves or others (committals are also subject to regular reviews by a judge).

</li><li> District Attorney Adrian Chase became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">The Vigilante</a>, because he was tired of seeing "by the book" arrests being quashed on technicalities. As Bob Ingersoll pointed out, this strongly suggests he became a DA without actually knowing what "by the book" <em>means</em>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> comics, being apprehended by the web-slinger (and possibly any costumed vigilante) is a violation of your civil rights and is the source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Joker Immunity</a> for anyone he has a hand in bringing down, particularly the Shocker, who gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOutOfJailFreeCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOutOfJailFreeCard">"Get out of Jail Free" Card</a> for breaking out of jail as well as for his original crimes which Spidey had nothing to do with. As of <em>Ultimatum</em>, the DA's office has done absolutely nothing about this loophole, instead blaming Spider-Man for their cases getting tossed. The Punisher is listening when this is brought up at Ryker's— a rapist says that he's free as a bird, because Daredevil beat the crap out of him as he was about to nail a thirteen-year old in a house he broke into and says that as soon as he's free he's going to finish what he started— aaand that's how the reader discovers that nesting the bowl of a spoon in your palm with the handle between your middle and ring fingers will enable you to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlashedThroat">slash open someone's throat</a></em>. The Kingpin was cleared of murder charges after his lawyer got the video of the murder ruled inadmissible. Even though news station played the video for all to see, the citizens of New York treat this as the same thing as him as being completely innocent.

<ul><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfic titled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/GrowingUpBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/GrowingUpBlack">"Growing Up Black"</a>, years after Sirius Black was sent to Azkaban, some of his relatives started having doubts about his guilt, decided to check the facts and found out he wasn't allowed to have a trial. They got him free by invoking a law stating that no pureblood can be forced to spend more than one month in Azkaban without a trial and that all charges against purebloods who are forced to stay more than that time there must be dropped. Sure, he's innocent, but since this is not what got him off, it can arguably be counted as a technicality.
<ul><li> Actually, while the law invoked to get him free was supposed to work regardless of Sirius being guilty or not, the relative who brought the case to the Wizengamot did point out reasons to doubt his guilt before invoking the law. However, people who don't believe Sirius Black's innocence usually say he got Off On A Technicality. It doesn't help that his family had to pull some strings just to have a chance to plead Sirius' case.
</li></ul></li><li> In another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfic, "My Parents' Secret Keeper", Sirius Black <em>did</em> get a trial and was acquitted but, since the Wizarding World believed him to be guilty, he wasn't allowed to take Harry away from the Dursleys. In that fic, the Fidelius Charm leaves a magical trace on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keeper</a> and Sirius Black had no sign of that trace, which got him acquitted on the charge of being the one who betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, despite everyone being sure the only reason he had no sign was that, with James and Lily dead, the trace had vanished. And Sirius couldn't prove his innocence on the mass murder charge because there were no witnesses (the wizarding world believed the lack of witnesses to be the reason he wasn't convicted). Years later, after Harry's second year at Hogwarts, Sirius found a law that allowed him to take custody of Harry. Unfortunately, Harry was so convinced of Sirius Black's guilt he refused to listen to his Godfather's pleas of innocence until Peter Pettigrew showed up and almost killed Harry in an attempt to get Sirius finally convicted of something. Peter wouldn't feel safe living as somebody's pet rat with Sirius free to look for him.
</li><li> In "These Grim Bones", yet another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fic portraying Sirius Black as a Death Eater who got Off On A Technicality, Cornelius Fudge, wanting to conceal the fact that (in the fic) some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> allegedly killed by the explosion actually fell victims to blunders from Obliviators, convinced most of the Wizengamot members to pass a motion to have Sirius only answer questions regarding his guilt or innocence of the crimes he's been charged with. Fudge's official excuse was that, even under Veritaserum, Sirius could twist the truth to the point of getting himself acquitted if he ever got a chance to give elaborate answers. After Sirius claimed under Veritaserum that he didn't betray the Potters to Voldemort, didn't kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> and didn't kill Peter Pettigrew, Albus Dumbledore accused Sirius of being able to overcome Veritaserum and tried to have him convicted on the remaining evidence, but failed, because it was Dumbledore himself who said Veritaserum would be needed to settle any doubts. That and the fact the Wizengamot wouldn't go back on the ruling of having Sirius answer only the basic questions got him acquitted but still believed to be guilty.

This would only invalidate the confession of that case (even without Scorpio's confession, there's more than enough hard evidence for a conviction), but certainly not Scorpio's <em>attempted murder</em> of Callahan, assault with a deadly weapon, possession of an illegal automatic weapon, and kidnapping him, which is enough for a life sentence by itself.
</li><li> In the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagnumForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagnumForce">Magnum Force</a></em>, the film opens with a known racketeer, his attorney, driver, and bodyguard being executed by a traffic cop after the former gets off on a technicality for the killing of a labor reformer and his family.
</li><li> The Sally Field movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EyeForAnEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EyeForAnEye">Eye for an Eye</a></em> has this as its premise, as a woman who loses her daughter to a rapist tries to get him behind bars, but seeks her own kind of justice on him after he gets off on a technicality. The tagline of the movie is "What do you do when justice fails?" In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, at the very least, the killer's constant making faces at Field would earn him a bunch of "contempt of court" charges.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, most governments would at least expel diplomats who were proven to be heroin smugglers, and probably be prosecuted at home to keep the host country happy (especially as South Africa was a strong US ally). Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">it doesn't turn out well for them in the end.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ANightmareOnElmStreet">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a></em>:
<ul><li> Child-killer Freddy Krueger was let off because, as expanded on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddysDeadTheFinalNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddysDeadTheFinalNightmare">Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare</a></em>, a drunken judge failed to sign the search warrant in the right place, so the parents of Elm Street banded together and burned him alive. A case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">Hollywood Law</a>, as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/law/back20021126.shtml">these<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/law/back20030121.shtml">articles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the column "The Law Is a Ass" detail why that particular arrest was, in fact, valid and wouldn't have been tossed out.
</li><li> The circumstances of Freddy's arrest are expanded on in a few books (including the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddyVsJason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddyVsJason">Freddy vs. Jason</a></em> novelization). Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> suspicious of Freddy actually broke into the Krueger house and utterly trashed the place looking for him, stumbling across Freddy's hidden "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoomFullOfCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoomFullOfCrazy">trophy room</a>" (where he kept scrapbooks containing newspaper clippings and such); afterward he rushed to the power plant, found Freddy there and brought him in.

</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreddysNightmares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreddysNightmares">Freddy's Nightmares</a></em> stated that Freddy got off simply because the arresting officer failed to read Freddy his Miranda rights (which is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">not legitimate</a>, since it only means any statements he made couldn't be used, but other evidence could be).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarChamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarChamber">The Star Chamber</a></em>, having to free obviously guilty murderers on technicalities inspires Judge Stephen Hardin to join a secret court which "tries", convicts and sentences them to death, with a hitman carrying it out. Two specific examples from early in the movie:
<ul><li> The film opens with a pair of undercover cops chasing a suspect who pops his gun into the trash when he gets home. The cops are unable to legally search the trash because they don't have a warrant, so they attempt a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> and search the garbage truck when they pick up the trash. In court, it comes out that the trash was still in the truck's hopper when it was searched, so it was still the suspect's trash. Judge Hardin reluctantly dismisses the case.
</li><li> A pair of men are picked up for raping and murdering a child when one of the cops claims to smell marijuana in their van and they find the victim's shoe. The technicality this time is that the search was illegal because there was no marijuana present in the van to justify the search. The reasoning behind this one is what drives Hardin to join the secret court. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The men are later revealed to be innocent as someone stole their van, let someone else use it to commit the rape/murder, and returned it without their knowledge.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiarLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiarLiar">Liar Liar</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until the end, where Fletcher gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment.</span>
</li><li> In the thriller <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SomeoneToWatchOverMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SomeoneToWatchOverMe">Someone To Watch Over Me</a></em>, the villain is released after being arrested for murder because no one read him his rights, even though he was never interrogated and no statements made by him were used as evidence against him. Especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm">facepalm-worthy</a>, since the movie actually (apparently unwittingly) provided a legitimate reason for why he might be released: he isn't represented by counsel during a lineup, even though he requests it, tainting the resulting identification (which is the prosecution's whole case).
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarlitosWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarlitosWay">Carlito's Way</a></em>, five years after drug dealer Carlito Brigante is sent to prison for murder, his lawyer gets him out because of prosecutorial misconduct and illegal wiretaps that led to the evidence being tainted. The judge that ordered Carlito's release made it quite clear this was the only reason he released him and deeply regrets having to do this (especially since it was the same judge who presided over his trial and sentenced Brigante to prison the first time anyway. In fact, he'd been forced to since the appeals court reversed his ruling).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> had his conviction from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">the previous Superman movie</a> overturned because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> didn't show up to testify against him in the appeal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">There is no testimony in appeal hearings</a>; only the trial record is reviewed, making this a research flub, as Luthor clearly said he got off because Superman didn't show up to testify at the latest appeal. The reason for this was that Superman had left Earth to follow a false lead regarding the remains of Krypton. The false lead was somehow engineered by Luthor himself exactly for the purpose of getting off on that technicality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheresSomethingAboutMary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheresSomethingAboutMary">There's Something About Mary</a></em>: Mary's architect friend, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who was actually a pizza delivery boy</span>, claimed Pat was a murderer who stayed in prison for five years until a technicality got him off. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The claim was false</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMurderOfCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AMurderOfCrows">A Murder of Crows</a></em>, the man responsible for the death of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>'s family got off on a technicality, and triggered his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>.

Naturally, his use of the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">gets called out</a> by the enraged Admiral.

In <em>The Short Victorious War</em>, Harrington learns that the reason Young was not removed from command after the events in On Basilisk Station was because he had covered his withdrawal with a barely justified return to the shipyard for repairs, a legal move, shielding him from retribution.

</li><li> <em>The Indictment</em> by Barry Reed, defense lawyer Dan Sheridan (the protagonist) uses this when defending a man charged with drunk driving. It seems like a slam dunk for the prosecution, but he faces an inexperience assistant DA. Thus, after the prosecution rests (with the case based solely on the testimony from the state policeman who arrested the defendant) he immediately moves for a judgment of acquittal. Why? Since the prosecutor didn't have the officer confirm the defendant was on a public road, or the driver of the car. As a result, the judge grants his motion, and chides the prosecutor, telling him to let it be a lesson in not forgetting the basics. Some of the jurors complain of this trope as they're leaving the courtroom afterward.

Martin says that when it came time to testify in court whether the man had his rights read in full, Martin lied that they were so he wouldn't get off on a technicality. He justifies it with the fact that the man had been arrested so many times that "he could have read me my rights" and that it was the right thing to do (since the man was a violent criminal). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">This misrepresents the nature of the Miranda warning</a>: the man <em>assaulted a police officer</em>, and the officer (just like anybody else) is legally perfectly able to testify about a crime if he's the victim, whether the suspect was Mirandized or not.

<ul><li> "Juvenile": A suspect cannot be tried as an adult because the murder took place before the law allowing minors to be tried as adults was passed and she's way too old to be tried in Family Court.

One example would be a letter written by the psychiatrist of the defendant to the victim warning her of danger was ruled inadmissible due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpousalPrivilege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpousalPrivilege">Spousal Privilege</a> (as the psychiatrist was counseling both as husband and wife). But since they were legally separated at the time, Jack McCoy was able to argue that spousal privilege was void, making the wife a third party to the sessions, thus voiding doctor-patient privilege, thus letting the letter back in and nailing the defendant.
<ul><li> In another episode, he's able to bring a priest up on sexual abuse charges for crimes that were technically well past the statute of limitations, by arguing that his attempt to bribe a cop (who was one of his former victims) to keep his mouth shut constituted a perpetuation of his crimes and therefore reset the statute. In fact, the major court arc in that episode is the arguments over whether the statute should apply or not; as soon as he realizes it's going to go through, the priest pleads out.

<ul><li> A sexsomniac mistook his fiancee's sister for his fiancee while "sleepwalking" and the DA can't charge him with rape because he wasn't conscious of what he was doing and he regularly had consensual sex with his fiancee in his unconscious state.
</li><li> An alcoholic blacked out to find he'd killed the woman he had a one night stand with. The DA bungles the case, first by accidentally showing a reconstructed video of the crime with his face tacked on instead of the video with the faceless model, then by showing up drunk to the hearing to determine if the case should be thrown out on her misconduct. She has to suffer through having the drunk test performed on her <em>in the courtroom</em> and fails, which results in her dismissal and sanctions.
</li><li> A murderous schizophrenic nutcase got his case thrown out after the overenthusiastic lab tech <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Dale Stuckey</a> mis-labeled his DNA sample.

<ul><li> The schizophrenic man did also try to kill two cops, both of whom can attest that it was him and that he indicated his intention to kill, so he's probably not walking away a free man. At best, he might get off on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense">Insanity Defense</a> and be put in a hospital instead of prison, which would probably be a good thing for everyone involved.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode had Novak and a judge actually join forces with a defense attorney to pull off a version of this. Earlier in the episode, Novak and the defense attorney had negotiated a plea bargain for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">a teenager who killed his mother's murderer</a>, only for the victim's relatives (backed by a lobbyist group) to sue in civil court to block the deal, which could set a very problematic precedent. So how do they solve it? When the opposing attorney in the case calls the criminal defendant as a witness, Novak and the judge persuade the defense attorney to let him testify in the civil case, knowing that in order to make his point, the plaintiff's lawyer will have to badger the boy into talking about the shooting. As soon as he does, the defense attorney appeals to the criminal judge for a mistrial, based on the fact that the defendant has just been compelled to incriminate himself in court, thus violating his Fifth Amendment rights. The criminal judge agrees and declares the case dismissed with prejudice (meaning he can't be re-tried on those charges). Casey immediately uses this as a basis to argue for the dismissal of the civil case, since there is no longer anything to fight over. The civil court judge agrees and dismisses the case.
</li><li> A case of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> occurred when a character who committed an outstandingly heinous (even for this show!) double murder, during which he buried a baby alive, got off because before he confessed and led the detectives to the corpses while waiving his right to counsel, he mentioned that he had an upcoming burglary case. Because the mention of the burglary case was an offhanded comment in the middle of a conversation, and the suspect didn't draw any attention to it, the detectives didn't pay it any mind, and he later argued that having mentioned his lawyer, even in the offhand way he did, constituted asking for a lawyer, so any further questioning and the responses elicited would be inadmissible — and the judge <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">agreed</a></em>. Unlike the other examples from SVU, this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">a deliberate plan by the suspect</a> rather than a bit of good luck for the defendant or the detectives grasping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>.

A sailor is charged with the murder of a prostitute in Baltimore, but the case is thrown out due to an improperly-written warrant. Everyone the sailor knows — including his wife — is convinced he's guilty; so he approaches Gibbs about re-opening his case...saying he's even willing to stand court-martial in an effort to clear his name.

In this case, the guilty party (a civilian) had murdered a marine on patrol at the Mexican border, having lured him over the border line so the crime wasn't committed on US soil and he can't be charged there. He admits to all this under interrogation, pointing out NCIS now have nothing to charge him with and no right to detain him. G thanks him for his cooperation and points out that since the perp knowingly attacked an on-duty marine, he's now an enemy combatant. Instead of the legal system with its rights and pre-hearings, he gets to be detained indefinitely as a POW in a military prison, and tried by a military court, and this interview is absolutely admissible as evidence. The perp <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">panics and tried to backpedal</a>, only for G to declare the interrogation complete and wish him luck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues">Hill Street Blues</a></em> had this come up regularly. On one occasion a murder trial nearly collapsed because the impound lot where a search of a seized car had lost its contract with the police department mere hours earlier, which meant that chain of evidence regs were technically violated for the murder weapon; fortunately the judge ruled it admissible despite this oversight. Another time a man on trial for rape had the charges dismissed because he claimed he didn't speak English and couldn't understand the officer giving out his Miranda Rights, and a sting operation had to be set up with an officer wearing a wire in order to prove he'd lied so that a retrial could go forward.

</div></li><li> Sideshow Bob tries to pull this off when he kidnaps Bart with the intent to kill him at "five corners" (a fictional location where five states come together). His plan is to stand in one state, fire the gun in the second, the bullet travels through the third, hits Bart in the fourth and he falls and dies in the fifth. Bob thinks it would be impossible to convict him because no single act in any state would be illegal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">This is of course</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonSensoleum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonSensoleum">complete nonsense</a>; he could be convicted of murder in <em>any</em> of those states or a federal court.

When Dr. Mrs. The Monarch asks her husband what Sunshine did to him, he explains (visibly annoyed) that Captain Sunshine is an idiot with no understanding of "due process": he flew the Monarch to the state prison, dumped him in front of the guards in the courtyard, then flew away (this is a jab at Superman's use of this tactic). The prison guards, however, simply let him go...given that he hadn't been formally given a trial of any kind, or even <em>formally arrested</em> in the first place.

<ul><li> One UK lawyer makes a very nice living getting the rich and famous off traffic tickets, speeding, drunk driving etc, exactly on this. The press started calling him "Mr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole</a>". He <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">trademarked it</a></em>.
</li><li> A great many cases the judges don't want to decide (that is, political cases) are dismissed when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">the judges rule that the person bringing the case doesn't have standing to sue or that there was some sort of error in the procedure of the court or administrative agency below</a>. This is especially true when the judges know that their decision would be hugely controversial (or alternatively, that they don't want to make the correct ruling because they like the status quo, even if it's wrong), but is especially common when, after reviewing the case and hearing oral arguments, the judges realize that they can't come to a majority decision on the merits, but that some technical ground exists that can avoid the embarrassment of a fractured or plurality decision.
<ul><li> A particularly famous case of this is <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_v._United_States">Clay v. United States<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, the case about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a>'s refusal to submit to the draft.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3c7mt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3c7mt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3c7mt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Details: As Thurgood Marshall had been in the employ of the Department of Justice at the time the case was initiated, he recused himself, leaving the Court at an eight-man panel. After oral arguments, the vote was 5-3 against Ali, but after Justice Harlan — who had been assigned to write the opinion — had read up on Black Nationalist and Nation of Islam doctrine, he was convinced that Ali really was a conscientious objector. This changed the Court to 4-4, which presented a problem — the Court <em>hates</em> 4-4 decisions, because they uphold the status quo without publishing an opinion, meaning Ali would go to jail and never even know why. Eventually, Justice Stewart found a technical issue in the procedure followed by the Draft Appeal Board, and a unanimous Court issued an opinion striking that procedure down.</span>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk_Grove_Unified_School_District_v._Newdow">That whole Supreme Court case<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about whether it violates the separation of church and state to have kids saying "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance at school <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">ended very boringly</a> when the Court ruled that since the father who filed the lawsuit didn't have custody of his kid, he couldn't claim to be protecting her First Amendment rights.
</li><li> The Scopes "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial">Monkey Trial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", over the teaching of evolution in schools. Scopes's conviction was set aside on appeal: the Butler Act, forbidding the teaching of evolution, carried a mandatory fine of $100, which is what Scopes had been fined when convicted. However, Tennessee law of the time forbade judges from setting fines above $50, rendering the judgment invalid. It's been suggested that the judge knew this and did it intentionally, so the supreme court could overrule him on technical grounds, preserving the law from a constitutional challenge. Not to mention the entire trial was a fabrication to save the town of Dayton, Tennessee by putting it on the map, bringing tourist dollars in — Scopes hadn't even violated the law, only going along with it for this purpose.
</li><li> This is what happened with <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollingsworth_v._Perry">Hollingsworth v. Perry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the case regarding California's Prop 8 (a ballot initiative prohibiting same-sex marriage). The Supreme Court kicked the case back to the lower court on the grounds that the plaintiff was not a party to the original case and therefore lacked the standing to appeal it (the original defendant, the state of California, had elected not to appeal after losing the initial case; a third party attempted to do so in its place), which meant that the original ruling would be upheld for the purposes of this specific case, but no precedent was set for the country at large.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4v79b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4v79b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4v79b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The exact same Supreme Court panel did, however, rule on the underlying issue two years later in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges">Obergefell v. Hodges<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.</span>
</li><li> The one about the cake baker who refused to bake one for a gay wedding? SCOTUS sidestepped the core issue about whether a businessperson can refuse service to a group on religious grounds (which would in essence re-legalize a form of segregation), in favor of ruling that the state ethics board which originally adjudicated the case had been unfairly biased against the baker <em>having</em> a religion.
</li><li> The 2019 US Census Supreme Court lawsuit. The SCOTUS sidestepped the larger question of whether the US Census form can include a question about whether the taker is a citizen, ruling instead that the Commerce Secretary didn't go though the proper channels to include the citizenship question on the census form in this particular case.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> If the US government has spied on you illegally and they classified the spying as secret, you can't sue. Because the fact that they spied on you is classified, you can't prove they spied on you. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catch22Dilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catch22Dilemma">If you could prove it, you could sue, but the evidence is secret, so you can't.</a> Even if you can prove that the government illegally spied on you, the feds will try to have the entire case thrown out on "state secrecy" grounds. Even if some of the evidence you have isn't secret. In evidence involving government spying, they can legally conceal the "sources and methods." All thanks to the Espionage Act.
</li><li> Very often, technicalities (for example, improperly collected evidence or confessions) will result in a retrial with said data excluded, not a defendant "getting off scot-free". Ernesto Miranda himself was convicted on retrial, and went to prison (though he was paroled in only three years).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">Older Than Radio</a>: The 1714 Riot Act (read out to persuade a group of 12 or more delinquents to disperse, and yes, this is the source of the expression "reading someone the riot act") featured precise wording in what needed to be said, and multiple cases were thrown out because of the omission of "God Save The King".
</li><li> As an example of how people think this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndersonCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndersonCooper">Anderson Cooper</a> reported a story about a young woman who robbed a bank, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">and then bragged about it on YouTube</a>. She even flashed the money she'd stolen in front of the camera. The police found out about the video, and compared it to footage from the robbery, and noticed that she was wearing the same clothes in both. They promptly went to her house and arrested her. A reporter filmed the arrest from a safe distance. As she was being put in the squad car, the robber looked right at the camera and said "They didn't read me my rights," with a smile on her face showing that she thought she was about to get off scot-free. She probably sobered up quickly when her lawyer explained the situation to her.
</li><li> An Australian man discovered that his bank would allow him to overdraft his bank account without any limit. He used this to pay off his mortgage and then spent the next few years living it up. By the time the problem was discovered, he had over-drafted his account by more than a million dollars. He was convicted of fraud and sent to jail. He represented himself at his appeal and argued that while his actions were immoral they were not actually illegal under Australian law. If he got the money by exploiting a computer glitch, it would be illegal but all his requests for money were actually approved by human bank officials. Fraud requires an element of deception but he never lied to anyone at the bank. Legally, all he did was ask the bank for a loan and the bank gave it to him no-questions-asked. The appeal courts agreed and overturned his conviction on the grounds that no crime was actually committed. He still owed the bank a ton of money but that was a civil matter. The bank seized all his assets but forgave the rest of the debt in order to avoid further bad publicity.
</li><li> In a non-criminal example, this is how supporters of 1912 US Olympic athlete Jim Thorpe got his medals from those Olympics reinstated after he was stripped of them for violating the rules at the time that required athletes to be amateurs. Rather than continue to argue the underlying violation, they pointed out <em>another</em> rule that required any protest of this type to be made within 30 days of the closing ceremony and provided evidence that the objections leading to Thorpe's disqualification had not been raised until after the 30-day window had already passed. It worked; Thorpe's medals were reinstated in 1983, 70 years after the initial disqualification.
</li><li> In the US State of Maryland, a man was involved in a very bad traffic accident. The news did not report if the man had been drinking, but since the State Trooper wrote him a ticket for reckless driving - a driving offense punishable by a fairly serious fine and points on his license - drunk driving was probably involved. At some point, probably a while after the accident, one of the victims died. The driver went to see a lawyer. The lawyer essentially told him to run, not walk, to the courthouse and pay the ticket before someone realized what was going on and cancelled it. So he paid the ticket, which is the equivalent of pleading guilty. Shortly thereafter he was charged with manslaughter, (either vehicular or involuntary, it didn't say) and was convicted. On appeal, the Maryland Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) found his paying the ticket was a conviction for reckless driving, making his subsequent trial for manslaughter a violation of double jeopardy, and set aside his conviction. <em>His paying a fine saved him from jail time and a criminal conviction.</em> To this day, many years later, police in Maryland never write a ticket for serious auto accidents with bodily injury or death until a prosecutor has a chance to review the case.
</li><li> As recounted in <em>Ojibwa Warrior</em>, Dennis Banks and others of the American Indian Movement were involved in a standoff with federal forces at Wounded Knee over an attempt to secede from the United States. Afterwards, at his trial, the judge dismissed the charges related to fighting the US Army because the military is not allowed to participate in civilian law enforcement.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5l3ir');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5l3ir" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5l3ir');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The rest of the case was dismissed separately for reasons that don't <em>quite</em> fit this trope.</span>
</li><li> Charles J. Guiteau, the man who shot US President James Garfield, attempted to do this in order to evade a murder charge, arguing that even though he shot Garfield, he wasn't responsible for Garfield's death because Garfield's death resulted from medical malpractice in the treatment of his injuries rather than as a direct result of being shot (which is technically true — many historians believe that Garfield would likely have survived with proper care — but does not negate the fact that Guiteau set the chain of events in motion). The argument failed to persuade, and Guiteau was found guilty of murder and executed.
